She wasn't someone who easily lost her temper, and her relationship with Philip hadn't even been clearly defined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't get so worked up over something like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Paige, let's talk calmly. This is a public place, so don't embarrass Philip like this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearing the conflict might escalate, I rushed forward and took Paige's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me not to embarrass him? Do you know what he said to me?" Paige was still on the verge of breaking down. "He said he doesn't know who's the father of my unborn baby! He said he won't take responsibility unless we have a paternity test after the baby's born! Madeline, what does he think of me? Does he think I'm some kind of cheap woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige couldn't hold back her heart-wrenching cries, and the implications of her words left me wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what do you mean by that? Are you saying you're pregnant? Paige, are you really pregnant?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like I had just heard the most unbelievable thing in the world. I was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had always been someone who lived for the moment and didn't believe in marriage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pregnancy and having a baby were things I couldn't believe were related to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew her better than anyone else. Despite enjoying the nightlife, she was not promiscuous. She wouldn't casually sleep with someone if she didn't have feelings for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, her overly emotional reaction tonight proved her deep affection for Philip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time I had seen Paige cry, looking so helpless and panicked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood better than anyone how much turmoil this child's arrival had caused her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, now that this has happened, we need to </span><span>deal with </span><span>it. Let's go somewhere and talk!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I approached Philip, grabbing him by the collar as my voice turned cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of my best friend's distress, I couldn't stand idly by.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip's defiant eyes met mine, and a hint of resentment appeared on his handsome face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's gone crazy. How can I reason with her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you mean you don't want to take responsibility for what you did?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was furious. Philip's indifferent attitude made me want to punch him, not just for Paige's sake but for my own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could act, Elliott, who was beside me, spoke up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, if you're a real man, you</span><span> should stand up</span><span> and take responsibility for Paige. There are too many people here. Let's go somewhere else and talk."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Elliott finished speaking, I felt a strong force supporting my waist from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hesitated for a moment, then turned to look at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he would have stood by and watched his friends mock me. He never took my side, let alone reprimanded his friend in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he stood firm beside me, disregarding the crowd's gaze, and chose to stand with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time I felt such powerful support, and my heart warmed even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip was known as a playboy. He never listened to his parents, but he always obeyed Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Elliott's words, Philip immediately stood up and said in a low voice, "Okay, let's talk somewhere else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip finished speaking and led the way out of the crowd.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="279.html">« Prev</a><a href="281.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
