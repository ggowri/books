Thanks to Lily's care during this period, you looked much better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never have done these things before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, seeing him being so considerate, both my dad and my mom were surprised, and they couldn't help but exchange glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline was a picky eater, so I catered to her preferences and made some food that she loved. Elliott, I don't know if the dishes I made suit your taste. If you like them, you can come back often in the future, and I will cook for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother quickly smiled and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, the food you cooked was delicious, no less than a Michelin chef. In the future, I will often bring Madeline back to eat here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled and said, and his words surprised me. I quickly said, "I already live at home now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect it, but he just smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were already married, but you kept living here. Austin, Lily, I want to take Madeline back today. It's been so long since we've been apart, and I miss her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words confused me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Does he... miss me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do you want to take me back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is Elliott up to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since we got married until now, the two of us haven't even had sexual intercourse. His sudden display of affection has left me at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him strangely, not knowing what kind of play he was acting. However, his eyes were exceptionally sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad and my mom heard Elliott say this, and the two of them looked at each other, instantly becoming even happier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They used to criticize Elliott before, just because they felt that Elliott didn't care enough about me. Tonight, Elliott took the initiative to give me a gift and came to pick me up. My dad immediately said, "That's right. We have been persuading Madeline too. Since she got married, she shouldn't keep living at her parents' house. Elliott, I'm very happy that you could come today. After dinner, I will let Madeline go back with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you haven't even asked for my opinion yet, how could you make decisions for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately expressed my opposition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I have always sided with my father, but this time I spoke up for Elliott. He deliberately put on a stern face and said, "Where have you ever seen a married daughter still living with her parents? Elliott came specially to pick you up today, so stop making a fuss. Since you two are married, you should live together and get along well, understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I didn't want to. The reason I moved back to live with my parents was that I didn't want to live with Elliott in the cold and lifeless Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't argue, Madeline. Elliott has already made concessions. Just listen to us and go back with Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what magic Elliott used, not only did my dad persuade me, </span><span>but </span><span>even my mom persuaded me to go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that I can only go back now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents have already said so, what else can I say? I could only pout and couldn't help but complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My complaints amused my dad, my mom, and Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of my parents, Elliott affectionately pinched my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your parents did this for our own good. They only have you as their precious daughter, and they want nothing more than to see you happy."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="76.html">« Prev</a><a href="78.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
