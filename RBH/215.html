I rarely have time to accompany Cormac, so let me look after him this time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing my words, Laura glanced at me subconsciously and was a little hesitant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Elliott spoke for me, "Madeline hasn't been feeling well in the past few days, so it won't be appropriate for her to stay. Mom, please stay and take care of Grandpa today. Madeline and I will take care of him tomorrow. As for Giselle, you'd better go back to work. Don't let my family's affairs delay your work."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was originally proud of herself, but as soon as Elliott said that, her eyes dimmed instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Elliott in disappointment and whispered, "Elliott, don't you consider me as your family member?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, but taking care of patients is very tiring, and you have your work to do. That's it. Dad, Mom, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't feel pity for her but said it seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then it's settled. The rest of you go back and rest. Your mother and I will stay here," Jasper agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Elliott and I left the hospital together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's attitude toward Giselle made me feel much better, so the moment I walked out of the hospital, I took the initiative to hold Elliott's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't been so proactive for a long time. Elliott was surprised by me for a second, but he soon turned to look at me and smiled slightly. Then, his palm naturally touched mine, and we walked side by side in the direction of our car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, Madeline!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when we were about to reach the car, we suddenly heard Giselle's voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice made me feel annoyed, but I still stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I turned around together and saw Giselle carrying a small black backpack and running towards us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong, Giselle?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned and asked calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, my mother didn't have time to thank you for sending her to the hospital last time. She wants to invite you to my home for dinner tonight. Would you like to come?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle looked at Elliott expectantly. Although I was standing beside Elliott, she had no intention of inviting me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned to look at me. At this time, we were still holding each other's hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said softly, "Let's go together and see Nicole?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that Giselle wanted to invite Elliott only, so I wondered whether it would make her unhappy if I went with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her existence was just to make me unhappy. Instead of letting her bother me, I'd better make her unhappy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll go wherever you go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Madeline, you can come with Elliott. I will call my mom and ask her to cook more dishes."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was clearly a trace of disappointment in Giselle's eyes, but she soon pretended to be happy.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="214.html">« Prev</a><a href="216.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
