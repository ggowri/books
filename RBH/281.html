"Paige, are you alright?" I asked, my concern evident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige pressed her lips before suddenly straightening up with resolve.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. Tonight, I'll have a serious talk with him. If that jerk doesn't want to own up, so be it. I'll head to the hospital tomorrow morning for an abortion," she declared firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her strong words, I detected a glint of tears in her eyes as she mentioned getting an abortion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless he leaves Hoswich, he's obligated to take responsibility for what he did." Elliott's deep voice sounded beside me, once again catching me off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these words, Elliott strode forward without hesitation, evidently intent on having a conversation with Philip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two go ahead. I'll stay and manage the party. With Elliott mediating, it should be fine. And Paige, don't rush into anything. This situation blindsided Philip, and he might need some time to process everything." Quinn's sudden appearance and reassurance to Paige and me provided some comfort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it," I responded, realizing that hosting such an event must have been stressful, and Quinn still had many tasks to oversee. With a nod, I swiftly escorted Paige out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and Philip sought out a quiet restaurant near Quinn's club, opting for a private room where the four of us could sit down together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't privy to Elliott's conversation with Philip, but once Paige and I were seated, Philip approached us, taking Paige's hand and saying softly, "I'm sorry, it was my fault. This situation caught me off guard, and I wasn't prepared, but don't worry. Since you're pregnant, I'll step up and take care of you, Paige."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's eyes welled with tears, and she averted her gaze, her voice tinged with frustration. "It's fine. If you don't want to take responsibility, you don't have to. I could just get an abortion."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Paige's strong demeanor, her emotions were palpable, and everyone could see she was on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Philip immediately knelt down, gently cradling Paige's face in his hands as he said earnestly, "Don't say that. This is an innocent life, and you can't just kill it. When you showed me the pregnancy test report, I didn't brush it off deliberately. I just didn't know what to do at that moment, but I've been reflecting a lot lately. Honestly, I've enjoyed our time together. I believe we could be great parents. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip's sudden change in attitude toward the matter was clearly influenced by Elliott's earlier words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback and couldn't help but steal a glance at Elliott. Unexpectedly, our eyes met.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reclined casually across from me, a lazy smile playing on his lips, drawing me in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was engrossed in Philip and Paige's exchange when suddenly I felt a discreet touch on my leg beneath the table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Elliott leaned forward, his hand disappearing from the chair. A warm sensation on my knee followed as his gentle touch traced along my thigh, sending a shiver through me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't anticipated Elliott's boldness. I felt momentarily flustered, unable to move or meet his gaze.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="280.html">« Prev</a><a href="282.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
