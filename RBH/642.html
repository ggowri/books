Listen to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle tugged at Laura's sleeve, covering her swollen face that had been slapped, and cried sorrowfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Explain then! What was that video just now? And what's the deal with that paternity test report? Speak now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was so angry that she seemed to have lost her sanity. She grabbed Giselle's hair directly and, while asking, couldn't help but shake Giselle's head fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, someone must have set me up. That video... the video was edited, and the paternity test was also fake! Laura, Doctor Louis had already conducted a paternity test for me and the child before. Haven't you already confirmed it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle immediately knelt down on the ground. She cried in a pitiful manner while vehemently denying everything that had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Laura had already become suspicious, how could she possibly believe Giselle's words? Laura looked at Giselle and said, almost crazily, "How dare you mention Doctor Louis? I now feel that I shouldn't have trusted you too much in the first place! Maybe you did something secretly about the child! I used to wonder why the Bryant family, with such good genes, could have such an ugly child. How could a normal child be so ugly? Now I understand, it turns out you are so dirty in private! Giselle, you have wasted my expectations of you, and you have also wasted the Bryant family's years of cultivation of you! You have disappointed me so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura angrily pointed at Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The evidence was right in front of her, and Laura was not a fool. With just a little bit of imagination, she understood the whole story, so she would not believe Giselle's words anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying all this, Laura looked at Giselle and stomped her foot hard. Then, she angrily left the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Laura, who valued dignity more than anything else, simply couldn't accept this fact. Therefore, she didn't even have the energy to pretend anymore. Laura left first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bryant family had such a huge scandal that it reached a point where it could no </span><span>longer be concealed. The guests first looked at each other in astonishment, and then whispered to each other. Soon, everyone started leaving as if they had agreed upon it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spacious venue, which was recently filled with guests enjoying themselves, suddenly became empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, there were many people, and I mingled in the crowd, managing to avoid the Bryant family. Seeing everyone leaving one after another, I also followed the crowd towards the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I saw Giselle rushing toward Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Giselle looked like a miserable stray dog, too afraid to stand up. She crawled all the way to Elliott, kneeling in front of him, as if grasping onto the last hope, and grabbed onto his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, someone must be framing me, they must be! Don't believe those things in the video just now. I... I am innocent, I truly am innocent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle cried again. Her wailing cry made her look very pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood still in his place, not even wanting to glance at Giselle. Then, I heard Elliott say, "I have had a paternity test redone. I have had someone verify the authenticity of the video. Giselle, you better start praying from now on, everything is being falsely accused. Otherwise, you know the consequences of provoking me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tone, amidst calmness, exuded immense indifference. Clearly, Elliott had already understood something in his heart.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="641.html">« Prev</a><a href="643.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
