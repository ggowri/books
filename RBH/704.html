I brushed it off, ignoring the deeper meaning behind his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood the deeper meaning in my words as well. He smiled calmly and said, "I knew you would say that. I have also been through the same phase as you. The reason I am telling you all this today is to let you know that you should never give up the entire forest for just one leaf. You are wonderful enough, and there are many people in this world who want to cherish you. Don't linger too long with those who don't appreciate you or trample on your inner self, and don't exhaust yourself too much. It's great to be an independent and strong woman, but if you become too tired, it's also a good choice to take a break and find solace in a man's embrace before continuing on. No matter which path you choose, you will encounter different scenery. Don't rush to cut off all possibilities, try to relax. You are too tense, Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You were too tense, Madeline...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words scratched lightly on my heart like a cat's claw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like being poked right at the core by someone, the tears that I had been holding back for a long time couldn't be restrained any longer and suddenly welled up from my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly turned around and looked out of the window. I didn't want Marcus, or anyone else, to see through my vulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he still saw it and quietly handed me a tissue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I silently shed a tear, but within a few seconds I regained composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly blew my nose with a tissue, and then, I took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I cannot relax now because there are still many things I haven't done. When my child is born, I will have to face many things. Moreover, my parents are also getting older, and there is Glory Group. Although the previous crisis has been temporarily resolved, managing such a large company and taking care of so many people who depend on it for their livelihoods, I have to consider all of these. I don't want to be a powerful woman, but I am very clear that I don't want to rely on a man. I only want to rely on myself and stand proudly in this world, whether it's in my career, my family, or my child. I will give it my all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is also the reason why I have not rested since I got pregnant until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to stop chasing the world's footsteps and give up everything just because I was pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spent too much time in the past ten years on dating.
