And judging by his appearance, he'd been waiting at the entrance of this neighborhood for quite some time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked just as worn out as I did, his eyes bloodshot. He stared at me and asked point-blank:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last night, I heard a child's cry over the phone. Madeline, since when did you guys have a kid?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, he heard me. And he was suspicious of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, I instinctively spun a lie:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, that's my relative's kid. He's been staying at my place for a bit recently."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Which relative?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started asking again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know him, I have a lot of distant relatives."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to fob him off with some lame excuse, but he wasn't having any of it. He gripped my shoulders, looking straight into my eyes:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, your folks live in here, right? Why won't you let me meet them now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started asking that question again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the question I dread the most is the one he might ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at him, feeling a wave of irritation. I began to explain:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, it's not that I don't want to, it's just that my parents aren't keen on meeting you. You know you haven't been the best to me in the past, so they're a bit put off by you. Plus, they had a long night yesterday and they're already exhausted. It's not a good time for you to come over."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Same excuse, again..." Elliott looked at me, his gaze complex as he said, "Madeline, it seems like you're keeping a lot of things from me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm off to buy some bread for my parents. Elliott, you should head to the office early. I'll be heading to Glory Group later, there's a ton of stuff waiting for me to handle today."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was at a loss for words, unable to explain to him. So, I made up an excuse on the spot. Then, I turned on my heel, intending to continue my journey towards the bakery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott suddenly grabbed my hand, wrapping his arm around my waist from behind. He pulled me close into his embrace, whispering softly into my ear:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I've laid all my cards on the table, so I expect the same from you, alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a hint of humble pleading in Elliott's tone that caught me off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mhm."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a soft nod, instinctively pulling away from his hand wrapped around my waist. After a moment's hesitation, I strode towards the bakery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bakery was bustling in the early morning, with various types of bread wafting a rich aroma.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam, I'd like some bread..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm a regular here, pretty chummy with the bakery owner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much is the total? I'll pick up the tab!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to pay, Elliott suddenly appeared behind me. His deep voice stood out in the crowd. The bakery owner immediately looked up, giving him a thorough once-over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clad in a casual black ensemble, Elliott's towering figure stood out in the crowd, his aura even more so. His commanding presence was impossible to ignore, leaving those around him in awe.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="899.html">« Prev</a><a href="901.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
