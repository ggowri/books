You are Madeline, right? I am a loyal fan of Do Not Love. And Lily and I are members of the same beauty salon. Lily often mentions you to me, but I haven't seen her recently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder she just spoke for me, it turned out she knew Lily. Then I thought she should know something about me from Lily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, my dad has been sick recently, so my mom has been taking care of him at home. May I know your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately started chatting with her. But I didn't expect that after I finished speaking, she immediately laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She patted Quinn's shoulders and then said, "Quinn, why didn't you tell Madeline who I am? I'm Quinn's aunt, Grey Woods. I thought you know who I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened my mouth in surprise. No wonder I felt familiar when I first saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outline of her facial features did look as familiar as Quinn's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't tell me earlier!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It would have been boring if I had introduced you to each other. You now know each other by yourself. Gray, she wants to cooperate with Benjamin. She will need your help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled slyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gray's husband was still chatting with others at this time. Hearing Quinn's words, Gray smiled and said, "Okay, Benjamin is talking with others. When he finishes, I will introduce you to him. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Gray introduced me to her husband, Benjamin Woods, the CEO of Infinite Precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Quinn's help and Gray's affection for me, Benjamin and I had a very good chat. In addition, Isaac had already made preliminary contacts with Infinite Precision before, so Benjamin also had a general understanding of Glory Group's situation in the mechanical field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked me to go directly to his office to see him with the information later. If all went well, we could start working together next spring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing him say this, I felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I could reach cooperation with Infinite Precision, Glory Group would no longer have to rely on Bryant Group's core components in the field of machinery. In this case, the businesses of Glory Group and Bryant Group would be completely separated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After talking with Benjamin, I breathed a long sigh of relief. I was a little tired because I had been busy all night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was pregnant and still in the first trimester, so Fiona told me not to be too tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Quinn helped me and found a restroom to let me lie down for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, as soon as we walked to the door of the lounge, we heard Elliott's cool voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Do you want to be alone in a room?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="458.html">« Prev</a><a href="460.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
