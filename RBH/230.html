Just let her go back to her parents' place."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood in front of me. When she saw Quinn and me standing side by side, his eyes became extremely cold, and the little blood seeping from the corner of his lips made his face even more ruthless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm asking you one last time. Will you come home with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone was cold. It was obvious that everything I did tonight had once again challenged his bottom line.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't seen my parents for a long time, Elliott."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I expressed my thoughts tactfully. I didn't want to be a woman who obeyed him and only thought about him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him firmly, not afraid at all, even though his eyes were terrifyingly cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's lips were pressed tightly, and his body was tense. He stared at me coldly and then took another glance at Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if he understood something, without saying anything, he turned around, silently walked back, and gradually disappeared into the night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at his back. For some reason, my heart ached violently at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn patted me on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He might have misunderstood my relationship with you. Are you sure you don't want to go back with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled bitterly, "Leave him</span><span> alone</span><span>. We will break up sooner or later anyway. If a misunderstanding can separate us sooner, it will be a good thing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn lowered his head and looked at me in surprise and worry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think so? But you still have feelings for him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head and gave a wry smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, even if I haven't moved on and love him, do you think things will work out between us?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's answer was cruel and direct.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since it won't, why should I care if he misunderstands me? Anyway, it will end the same way."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, suddenly feeling that the path I had taken was so hopeless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't been reborn and didn't know the outcome, I might have loved Elliott regardless of the consequences as I did in my last life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I already knew how the story between Elliott and me ended. No matter how much we would go through and whether we loved each other, the thought of our ending made me feel </span><span>helpless</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's getting late. I'll walk you to your door."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Quinn suddenly twitched his mouth, and then blood flowed from his nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have a nosebleed. Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I exclaimed, hurriedly took out a tissue, and handed it to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He hit me so hard that my nose bone was almost broken," Quinn said helplessly,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you still be friends after the fight? It's all my fault. I'm sorry to have affected your friendship."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blamed myself upon hearing his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. We have known each other since childhood. I know him better than any</span><span>one</span><span>. Our friendship will not be affected by you. Even if it is affected, it will only be for a short period."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn had faith in his relationship with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And precisely because he knew Elliott better than anyone else, he knew if Elliott and I would end well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it this way, I felt more and more hopeless about Elliott and my future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn crumpled a tissue into a small ball and stuffed it into </span><span>his </span><span>noses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We walked forward slowly and unknowingly arrived at the door of my house. It was almost two o'clock in the middle of the night.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="229.html">« Prev</a><a href="231.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
