You'd better give up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of Giselle's message, there was a smug emoji. Although I didn't see her face, I knew how proud she must have been at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at this message, I couldn't help but snort coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "You can be proud for a few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more proud you are now, the more tragic your ending will be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then I calmly put away my phone. At that moment, Quinn came in, carrying a bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he walked in, he said to us, "Have you had breakfast? I bought sandwiches and hot milk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching the performance all morning, I felt hungry. I took breakfast from Quinn's hand and started eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's still down. Quinn and I comforted her for a long time until she finally drank a cup of hot milk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished breakfast, Quinn called me out of the ward. He whispered to me, "I have some bad news to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This morning, the police informed me that Jezebel had been released on parole."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't want Paige to know, so he lowered his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Quinn's words, I raised my voice and asked in shock, "What? How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone helped her. I didn't know who that person was," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about what Elliott said yesterday, I think he was probably secretly helping Jezebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered, "Who else could it be except Elliott? This morning, Giselle performed a suicide act on the rooftop. Elliott must have compromised with her and agreed to her demands. After all, Giselle gave birth to his son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing my words, Quinn said contemptuously, "Is Giselle going to jump off the building in the morning? This woman will stop at nothing to achieve her goals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I crossed my hands and said calmly, "It's normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I felt that the Bryant family would soon announce the news of Elliott and Giselle's engagement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to my words, Quinn gave me a meaningful look. He was afraid I would be hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked me tentatively, "If they got engaged, would you be upset? If you feel uncomfortable, we can also announce that we are engaged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head and said, "I didn't care about him anymore, so why would I feel uncomfortable? Quinn, you don't have to keep thinking about me. Engagements and marriages shouldn't be taken lightly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't take it casually. I mean it. I would always be your most reliable retreat," Quinn said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn became relaxed when he heard me say that I didn't care about Elliott and Giselle's engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why was Jezebel able to be paroled, Quinn?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The police said there is insufficient evidence to charge Jezebel with intentional murder. The current evidence only proved that Jezebel caused signs of miscarriage in Paige, but Paige voluntarily requested the abortion after going to the hospital, so..." Quinn explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to his words, I immediately understood and couldn't help but glance towards the direction of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jezebel was lucky. If we told Paige about this, she would be very emotional, and I don't know what she would do."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="621.html">« Prev</a><a href="623.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
