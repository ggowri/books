Seeing us taking photos, they immediately came forward and invited me to take a group photo for them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I readily agreed. They stood where we had just stood in a very intimate pose, and I took a few photos of them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's rare to meet a couple while climbing a mountain. Let us take group photos for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This couple was particularly enthusiastic and said to us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? Thank you, but we just took solo photos..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I had never taken a group photo. I was a little shy to take photos with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Elliott nodded, walked to that position, and waved to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here, let's take photos."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had already said that. I couldn't refuse anymore, so I walked over with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott naturally put his arm around my shoulders and motioned for me to put my arm around his waist. Then, the couple quickly took a few photos of us. We exchanged contact information and sent photos to each other through WhatsApp. After thanking them, we continued climbing to the top.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travel could not only broaden people's minds but also eliminate the barriers and grudges of the past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found that when we weren't in Hoswich, my relationship with Elliott had become more harmonious than ever before, and he could even drink a bottle of water with me naturally.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could we be so intimate?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had thought I could never cross the gap between me and Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after spending the two days together, I began to doubt this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We stood on the top of Flora Mountain. The wind blew. I watched him standing on a boulder not far away. His tall figure looked more majestic against the blue sky.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attachment to him deep in my heart suddenly surged again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I told myself to be rational and keep myself away from him, and I thought I could finally let go of the past... But I had to admit that as long as Elliotts showed tenderness to me, I could not bear to refuse him. And I would only become more addicted to him uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was I really willing to give him to Giselle?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong sense of unwillingness rose in my chest. I clicked Instagram. When I found that Elliott posted a group of photos of the scenery on Flora Moutain, I posted the group photo of him and me on Instagram. This time, it was still only opened to Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, she often used this trick to force me to see reality.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in this life, I could use her method to let her see the reality and recognize her status.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt more relaxed inside after posting the photo. I walked toward the boulder where Elliott was standing. Elliott looked down at me and pulled me up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He helped me to stand on the boulder. The uneven surface almost made me lose my balance. Fortunately, he put his hand on my waist and steadied me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott hugged me, and I looked up at him. The moment our eyes met, I felt like there was an electric current flowing between us. He leaned over and kissed me...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="210.html">« Prev</a><a href="212.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
