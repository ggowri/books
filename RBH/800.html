Subsequently, he led me across to the SkyPark restaurant, perched atop the skyscraper opposite my office, for a meal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the folks dining in such a charming place are usually couples.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rooftop was vast and expansive. Customers dined within individual white tents, each arranged to exude a sense of comfort and ease. Despite their tented nature, they were far from cramped, and the seating within was exceptionally cozy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We chose a spot tucked away in the corner to settle down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he sat down, Quinn looked at me with a face full of worry. His usually cheerful face was noticeably clouded over:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really have to do this? There are many ways to heal, it doesn't necessarily require your involvement. After all, medical science is so advanced now. Unless... you want to get back together with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" I vehemently denied, shaking my head vigorously. "I have absolutely no intention of getting back together with him. It's just that, all his injuries now are because he saved me. I don't want to owe him anything. Besides, Dr. Jones has already prescribed him medication, so the treatment process shouldn't take too long. Once the blood clot in his brain is gone and his memory is restored, naturally, I'll cut off all ties with him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that simple, you know," Quinn said, taking a sip of the bitter coffee in front of him, his eyebrows furrowed in concern. "Two people who once loved each other, now back in close proximity. Are you sure you won't fall for him again? Remember, he's the one you've had feelings for, for many years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood the apprehension in Quinn's heart, so I took the initiative to grasp his hand. The moment I touched his hand, I distinctly felt a slight tremor, as if he'd been shocked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I've got a handle on my heart. He won't sway me again. And even if he does, the mere thought of Noah will make me draw the line. After the way his parents treated me in the past, there's no way I'd let Noah get to know them. That should put your mind at ease, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my words, the tension on Quinn's face eased instantly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe this much. If it weren't for their interference, Noah would bear the name Mayers, destined to be a part of your family. But if the Bryants get wind of Noah's existence, they'll undoubtedly move heaven and earth to reclaim him. And given how much your parents dote on Noah now, they'd never let him go back to the Bryants. This tug of war between two families would only inflict more harm on Noah."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn really gets me. The moment I speak, he knows exactly what I'm thinking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah... I don't want my Noah to be torn apart in the future due to his complicated background. Besides, the Bryant family has done me wrong in every possible way, leaving no room for forgiveness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even if Elliott manages to move me again in this process, there's no way I'd remarry him, not when I have Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you understand, why worry then?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I flashed a small smile, not wanting to delve further into this topic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled, instantly clearing the gloom from his face:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I trust you. Let's not dwell on that anymore. You must be exhausted from all the hassle last night. The main courses and desserts here are quite delightful. I've ordered some of your favorites. Let's savor the food."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had Quinn finished speaking than the waiter brought the food.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dishes here are generally on the pricier side, but they're beautifully presented. Both the appetizers and main courses are unique, with a hint of Thai flair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn ordered a ton, and in no time, the entire table was swamped with delicious food.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aroma of the food wafted into my nostrils, instantly igniting my appetite. So, Quinn and I dug in, laughing and chatting as we savored every bite.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn has always been a free-spirited optimist. After chatting with him a lot, he instantly let his guard down.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="799.html">« Prev</a><a href="801.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
