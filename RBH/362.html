Breaking the silence, I asked casually, "Toby, I heard Mr. Bryant bought you a house?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby's response was humble. "Yes. I initially declined due to the high price, but Mr. Bryant insisted on covering the cost upfront. I'm grateful."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His simplicity stood in stark contrast to Giselle's greed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need for thanks. It was Mr. Bryant's idea. By the way, how's your sister lately?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I probed, hoping for some insights.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby shrugged. "She recently broke up with a classmate and has been helping out at the Bryant Villa, looking after Mr. Cormac Bryant. Why do you ask?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me with confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lack of connection with Giselle intrigued me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as we boarded the bus with Elliott, Toby's gaze remained peculiar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just making conversation," I replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that there were no more clues from his side, I dropped the topic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Glory Group, I mulled over our next moves.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade and my uncle, Bruno Sullivan, were currently in police custody, adamantly refusing to plead guilty despite the mounting evidence against them. This posed a significant challenge for Glory Group, especially considering the substantial funds they illicitly siphoned abroad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bringing them to justice was proving to be a complex task, and even with legal aid from Alexis, my prospects looked bleak. The best outcome I could hope for based on current evidence was a sentence of 1-2 years in prison for Jade and Bruno, with the possibility of probation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Katrina Mason did some digging and found out the damage caused by Jade and Bruno's antics could be over 500 million dollars.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a gut punch for Glory Group, and it was a bitter pill to swallow to me knowing those two might just get away scot-free.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at least I had managed to kick those troublemakers out of the Glory Group. Now, the most important thing was to patch up the mess they left behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a strategic meeting with Adam, Isaac Norris, and Katrina, I outlined our plan moving forward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from our core machinery business, we would support investments in healthcare and entertainment while phasing out real estate and cutting automotive and finance ventures.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam would spearhead business development in the film and television sector, while Isaac would oversee real estate, finance, and automotive divisions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I concluded the meeting, I couldn't help but feel the weight of responsibility on my shoulders. Every decision carried immense implications, underscoring the complexities of leadership.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While I longed for my father's recovery and guidance, I understood that, for now, I must navigate these challenges alone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the uncertainties, I remained resolute in my determination to lead Glory Group forward, one step at a time.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="361.html">« Prev</a><a href="363.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
