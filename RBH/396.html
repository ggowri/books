She scrambled to get Elliott to back off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, Giselle's got a baby now! Can you just chill for a sec? Let go first, and then you can say whatever. But if there's any drama with that baby bump, explaining it to your parents is gonna be a total nightmare," she pleaded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're saying this kid's mine, so I need some proof today! Doc, run some tests on her! I wanna know if that baby bump's really mine, no ifs, ands, or buts," Elliott shouted towards the door of the ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Elliott's shout, the doctor outside hustled in. With Elliott's orders, he wasted no time and turned to Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he said, "Ms. Cole, Mr. Bryant's calling the shots. Please cooperate, alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's eyes widened in shock, and she grabbed onto Elliott's sleeve.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what's this about? What are they gonna do to me? I'm not down for it! I heard those tests can be rough on the baby with the needle and all...."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't sweat it, Ms. Cole. Our gear's top-notch, won't harm the little one," the doctor reassured Giselle in a flash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Cole, since you're so sure this baby's Elliott's, why not put it to the test in front of everyone? It's a big deal, after all," Quinn piped up, breaking his silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's patience hit rock bottom, his voice dropping to a firm shout.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What're we waiting for? Get her outta here, now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor didn't waste a second, calling in some nurses to take Giselle out of the ward quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott's resolve, Giselle ditched the pity party act and shot me a look that said it all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, usually all delicate, was like a different person right now. She stood tall, giving me this icy stare that practically dared me to respond.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm down for the DNA test, but here's the deal. If this kid turns out to be Elliott's, are you gonna divorce him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her confidence was through the roof... like she was dead certain this baby was Elliott's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sent a shiver down my spine. I clenched my fists, my voice frosty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, whatever goes down between me and Elliott is our business, got it? It's got nada to do with you or that surprise package in your belly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Elliott, your turn. If this baby's yours, are you gonna step up for me and the kid? Because if you are, I'm down for the test."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle caught onto my vibe and shifted her gaze to Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You feeling guilty throwing conditions around like this? Or is there a chance this baby isn't Elliott's, and that's why you're so scared of a test?" Quinn jumped in, picking up on Giselle's game and deciding to play along.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not joking about something like a kid. But since I'm being pushed into this test, I'm gonna need some answers too. Otherwise, who's gonna handle the fallout from this test?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle put on a brave face, covering her belly and making her case.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smart cookie, that one. Even though she was freaking out a minute ago, she wasn't backing down from Elliott now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will handle any consequences."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="395.html">« Prev</a><a href="397.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
