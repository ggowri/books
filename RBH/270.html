However, you took my grandson back today, which is a great favor. Well, I'll prescribe you several pieces of medicine, and you can give it a try for the time being. If it doesn't work, come back, and I'll think of something else for you," Patrick said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was overjoyed to hear his words. It looked like there was a glimmer of hope that I could get pregnant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick quickly prescribed some medicine for me and asked me to pick them up from him tomorrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked him how much it cost, but to my surprise, Patrick waved his hand in denial. "The medicine doesn't cost anything. Consider it my repayment to you for returning my grandson."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can that be? Doctor Cullen, you must accept the money anyway." His explanation made me anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Patrick waved his hand calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't back down. I'm someone who sticks to his decisions. I appreciate your help today. I will try my best to heal you, but pregnancy is also about chance. I want you to relax and let nature take its course. Don't force it too much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that said, Patrick stood up, his actions suggested he was seeing me off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was somewhat arrogant. In dealing with such a man, it would be better to respect his opinions.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew he wouldn't accept the money, regardless of what I said, so I expressed my gratitude repeatedly before bidding farewell to Patrick.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Byron in his arms, he walked me to the door and returned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I left Patrick's house, it was still early, and the rain had stopped long ago, so I went alone to the night market not far from this old street.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the tranquility of this street, the night market was hustling and bustling. Various vendors put all kinds of small things on the street. It had been a while since I last went shopping. I bought a lot of rare gadgets on a whim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My long-dormant heart gradually opened up with this hangout. When I was feeling extra relaxed, Quinn called me out of the blue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got straight to the point and asked, "Madeline, where are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just wandering around the night market. What's wrong? What can I do for you?" I asked on the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The night market is boring. Come to my club in Louis City. There's a Halloween costume party tonight. I heard you've wrapped up that play. Come and relax," Quinn smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I hadn't seen each other for half a month while I was in Louis, but he had been calling me once or twice a day to talk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he never asked me what had </span><span>happened </span><span>between Elliott and me that night or what I was going to do, I knew in my heart that he was trying to provide me in this way with the comfort and warmth of a confidant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, we had become particularly familiar friends with each other. Hearing his invitation, I subconsciously wanted to go over and relax, but on second thought, I immediately said bitterly, "Did you just say it's a Halloween costume party? Where am I going to find a costume when it's so impromptu?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's quite easy. You're at the night market. There's a store that sells fancy clothes right there. Pick up an outfit now and hurry over," Quinn immediately suggested.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="269.html">« Prev</a><a href="271.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
