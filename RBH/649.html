Afterward, I drove directly to Quinn's clubhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn knew that I was very happy tonight, so he specifically called Fiona and Paige to accompany me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was pregnant and couldn't drink alcohol, and Paige had just had a miscarriage so she couldn't drink either. The two of us drank fresh fruit juice, while Quinn and Fiona had wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I vividly described everything that happened tonight in the banquet hall to them without mentioning that I met Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were very interested and felt excited after hearing the jokes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great job, Madeline. You did well! That despicable person will never be able to hurt you again from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Giselle hurt you for so long, you should have treated her so harshly and made her a laughingstock!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel sorry for the Bryant family. The video of their engagement banquet was spread all over Instagram. My parents told me about it after attending the banquet. It was so funny! I bet Laura never imagined that the grandson she had wanted for so long was Giselle's bastard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bryant family is a joke now. No one will respect them in Hoswich city in the future! Madeline, you are amazing. How did you discover those things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was captured by a friend of mine by accident. He originally intended to film Jezebel, but accidentally captured Giselle and Jezebel together," I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever I mentioned Jezebel, Paige instantly became angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You mean Giselle and Jezebel were together with those male models? Where's the video? Send it to me! I must make that bitch Jezebel lose everything too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I will send it to your email later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded immediately. Afterward, Paige and I celebrated with fresh juice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Paige and me in our current state, Fiona, who was sensible, couldn't help but laugh and tease, "I am glad that you've both moved on. I've told you that love is unreliable. You should focus on making money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, from now on, we will focus on making money and never believe in guys again!" Paige and I immediately agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not every guy lies. I am a good man!" Quinn hurriedly explained upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of us were having a lively conversation when, at that very moment, a waiter pushed open the door and walked up to Quinn, whispering, "Mr. Woods, a few VIPs have just arrived. They want the best room and the finest wine, and they also want us to find them female companions. Would you like to go and have a look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just arrange it for them," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you know them, so I thought you probably want to have a look," the waiter said hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your good friends, Mr. Bryant and Mr. Arnold..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and Philip?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and I were instantly shocked. She immediately asked loudly, "Is it Philip? He will never change."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige shouted very loudly. And as soon as she finished speaking, the door to our room was suddenly pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after, Philip's voice suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have changed. I swear. It wasn't me who asked for girls!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="648.html">« Prev</a><a href="650.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
