Plus, from Elliott's reaction, it doesn't seem like he and Giselle really have any connection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During pregnancy, it's possible to do DNA testing through amniocentesis. However, she needs to cooperate for that to happen," Fiona added.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige then chimed in, frowning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although we don't know what Giselle's intentions are, I don't think she'd dare to deceive the Bryant family, such a powerful and influential family, with a child from someone else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us were discussing when Quinn pushed the door open and walked in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the snacks they had bought on the table, Quinn must have been really hungry because he started eating without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn ate a lot before coming over to me and saying, "Madeline, Elliott wants to talk to you alone, but he's worried about affecting your emotions. What do you think, do you want to talk to him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he mentioned Elliott, my heart felt like it was scratched by cat claws.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Quinn instinctively. His eyes at that moment were calm and determined. It seemed like he had had a calm conversation with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I also need to have a good talk with him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My emotions were gradually calming down, and I slowly realized that now wasn't the time for emotional outbursts or tantrums.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this whole thing exploded like a bomb between Elliott and me, the person who triggered this bomb wasn't us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I fell into Giselle's trap like this, then I would be truly foolish.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My answer clearly relieved Quinn instantly. He immediately blinked at Fiona and Paige.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's leave the two of them alone and go out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Quinn left the ward with Fiona and Paige. Soon, I saw a tall, strong figure push open the door and walk in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worthy of being recognized as a noble man of Hoswich, even after a sleepless night and looking a bit disheveled, Elliott still possessed an unparalleled, distinctive aura. His perfect figure and those strong long legs drew people's gaze involuntarily to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott walked briskly towards me, not choosing to sit on the chair but instead sitting on the edge of the bed. Without a word, he pulled me, who had become thin and frail, into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively wanted to resist, but my hands were too weak from not eating for so long, lacking strength.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to push him away when he held my hand firmly in his palm. With a mature and steady voice, he said to me, "I've thought about it over and over. That night at Dikio, I did get drunk, but not to the point of being unconscious or not knowing I had sex with a woman. Honey, do you believe me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like he knew exactly what mattered most to me, this time, Elliott didn't evade, didn't sugarcoat, and didn't avoid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He straightforwardly addressed the part that mattered most to me. The sudden "Honey" he said was like a small hammer, tapping open a small crack in my tightly closed heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she's so certain the child is yours. How do you explain all of this then?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I couldn't push him away due to lack of strength, I lazily leaned against Elliott's chest, weakly asking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know. But I can't admit to something I haven't done," Elliott said in a deep voice. At the same time, he lowered his head, lifted my chin, and looked at me with concern.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="373.html">« Prev</a><a href="375.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
