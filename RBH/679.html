If you truly loved Madeline, you should have let go and allowed her to choose her own happiness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn angrily accused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My own happiness? Are you referring to yourself? Quinn, you should be well aware whether or not you can achieve it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stared at Quinn, his icy and narrow eyes filled with a hint of mockery toward Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words seemed to have a different meaning... However, I was not clear about what it was exactly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn couldn't hold back anymore and directly swung a punch toward Elliott's face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden act of violence startled both Sylvia and me, and we let out a loud scream. I hurriedly rushed forward, attempting to pull them apart, but it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's punch landed solidly on Elliott's nose. Blood immediately started trickling from his nose. He slowly turned his head and looked at Quinn, his eyes glowing with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He covered his face, and his fists were clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, this is the first time I am speaking to you as Madeline's boyfriend. From now on, I forbid you from getting anywhere near Madeline, do you hear me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Quinn finished speaking, Elliott immediately swung a punch toward </span><span>Quinn's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not your turn to give me orders! Besides, you don't have the right to say you're Madeline's boyfriend. When has Madeline ever admitted it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I admit it now, and I will continue to do so. I have always emphasized to you that Quinn is the father of my child! How many times do you want me to say it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was almost driven crazy by Elliott's stubbornness. I couldn't control my emotions anymore and I shouted loudly at Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it! Unless I wait until the child is born to do a paternity test, I will never believe that is not my child!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, seemed oblivious. He appeared to be trapped in some kind of illusion, and no matter how hard Quinn and I tried to pull him out, he refused to wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, and there was no trace of love in my eyes or heart anymore. I couldn't even remember why I used to love him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He in front of me only made me feel unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough, Elliott. I don't want to hear any more. If you don't leave, we will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed Quinn's hand directly and no longer wanted to stay in the same space as Elliott. Without any hesitation, I immediately walked out of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, a forcibly twisted melon is not sweet. You should understand this principle, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia couldn't help but interject when she saw the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as she finished speaking, I heard an incredibly loud sound coming from behind me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sound surprised me thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly turned my head and saw Sylvia, whose face was already swollen and red, being slapped by Elliott. Her face was slapped to one side. She covered her face and tears immediately started flowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injuries on her face were already severe enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott actually made a move on her!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="678.html">« Prev</a><a href="680.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
