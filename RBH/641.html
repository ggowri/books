Once again, the scene fell into a deadly silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host was experienced yet still at a loss now. He didn't know how to salvage the situation in the face of such an epic and shocking scene.

However, Quinn had already briefed the personnel beforehand, and Ken's technical skills were far beyond an ordinary hotel technician.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, no matter how anxious they were, they couldn't do anything about the scene, which was firmly controlled by Ken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screen went black again, and that eerie music reappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think it's over? No. There's something more exciting! Here, I'd like to congratulate Mr. Bryant. Congratulations on becoming the father of another man's child and taking responsibility for this group of indulgent men and women! Great man, I admire you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the sound ended, the paternity test report was also presented on the big screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banquet hall was so big, and correspondingly, the screen was also very big. The report was displayed on the screen, with each letter being enlarged to a size that was big enough for everyone present to see clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The displayed "no blood relation" above was enough to shock the Bryant family present at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle couldn't believe it. After meticulously planning everything, she was about to marry Elliott. However, at this final moment, her dream shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stood still, feeling helpless and trembling uncontrollably all over her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively walked up to Elliott and tried to grab his hand, but Elliott forcefully pushed her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, are you okay?
