Don't make a scene here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn cast a disdainful glance at Giselle and told Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face was sullen. He didn't say much or respond to Quinn. Instead, he dragged me out of the bar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly followed and called out loudly from behind, "Elliott."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, kept pulling me forward, not bothering to turn back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he had deeply misunderstood my relationship with Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Elliott pulled me to his car, Quinn had already caught up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me and Madeline went to see her cousin tonight, and we passed by this bar on the way back. We just figure we could have a few drink to celebrate. It's not that complicated as you think."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was clearly worried that Elliott might misunderstand, so he explained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is my woman. She doesn't need your copany."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't buy it and ignored his explanation at all. He just pushed Quinn aside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was also enraged. He grabbed Elliott's arm and growled in a low voice. "Elliott, can you stop being so possessive? Do I look like someone who would steal your woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then stay away from my woman. She doesn't need your fake concern."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Elliott flung the car door open and shoved me inside without another word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn anxiously banged on the car door, wanting to say something more. But Elliott simply ignored him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed the car door shut, not bothering with Quinn, and simply floored the accelerator. The car sped away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott drove at breakneck speed, leaving me dizzy until I finally managed to steady myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the traffic was light at the late night, the way he sped along the main road and his furious expression still left me terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gripped the back of the front seat tightly and yelled at him, "Elliott, have you lost your mind? You're driving too fast!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't turn around or look at me, not until he reached the famous road of Hoswich, Seashore Road. There, he abruptly slammed on the brakes, stopping just a step away from the guardrail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't buckled up, and I nearly flew out of the back seat after the sudden stop. My head banged hard against the back of the front seat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the seat was fully covered in leather, so it wasn't painful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But still, Elliott's sudden madness left me speechless. Angrily, I muttered under my breath, "What a maniac..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense discomfort in my stomach forced me to immediately push the car door open. I leaned over the railing, and as a chilling sea breeze blew, I couldn't help but vomit out all the alcohol in my stomach.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott appeared behind me at some point. Just as I turned around after finishing, he leaned in, pressing his entire body close.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He braced his hands on the railing, trapping me tightly in his arms. His eyes bore into me with an oppressive intensity, as if he was about to eat me alive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed his lips together. His cold words echoed with the bleak sea wind, "Do you have to be so close to Quinn? Have you ever considered my feelings? Do you even see me as your husband?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="332.html">« Prev</a><a href="334.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
