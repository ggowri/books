My brother has spent all the money he has earned over the years, and my mother has only saved 300,000 dollars after working hard for so many years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was depressed when speaking of her poverty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but wonder if she used the same method to get that apartment from Elliott in my previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe things were not what I used to understand. Could it be that Elliott gave her the property out of compassion for her family rather than love for her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While I was thinking quietly, Elliott said, "It doesn't matter. I can lend you the money that you lack first, and you don't have to pay it back in a hurry. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Elliott, you have helped my family a lot. You've paid my tuition fees and living expenses, as well as my mother's medical expenses over the years. How can we use your money to buy a house?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle waved her hands hurriedly and seemed to refuse Elliott's suggestion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I clearly felt that she was not that sincere. If she really didn't want Elliott's money, she wouldn't have told him how tough her family's financial situation was just now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Elliott parked the car in front of Nicole's flower shop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said softly, "Let's discuss this with your mother later. Come on, let's get off the car."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott jumped out of the car first, and Giselle and I followed. Then, we walked into the flower shop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle and Nicole lived in a two-story building behind the flower shop, which looked old and mottled. However, the pots of flowers placed in the yard made it look quite beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole had already prepared many dishes. Seeing Elliott and I come in together, she was stunned for a moment but immediately put on a friendly smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Elliott, Madeline comes with you. I've rarely seen you here. Come on, please take a seat. My house is shabby. I hope you don't mind."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not, Nicole. I have always heard that your cooking skills are very good, so I'm honored to taste your dishes," I said politely with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm glad you're here. Please have a seat. Giselle, entertain the guests first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole looked very enthusiastic and immediately went to prepare coffee.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, Giselle, and I sat down around the small square dining table. I looked at the dishes on the table. Although the food materials were not expensive, every dish looked delicious and was delicately prepared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Giselle was very good at cooking in the last life. It seemed that she had learned it from her mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle brought us knives and forks, and then let us start eating. Elliott picked up the fork first, put a piece of cucumber into his mouth, and tasted it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle sat down next to Elliott. As she saw him only eating cucumber, she immediately talked to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, try my mother's roast beef. This is my mother's specialty dish."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott nodded and brought a piece of roast beef to his mouth, but his hand shook accidentally, and the piece of beef fell and rolled off his suit. As a result, his suit was stained with sauce and grease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't move! I'll wipe the stain for you," Giselle exclaimed, hurried to pick up the tissue on the table, and carefully wiped the stains on his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed that she deliberately got so close to him that she almost fell into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wiping the stains, she even grabbed his hands and began to wipe them carefully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing another woman wiping his clothes and hands in front of me without caring about my presence, I suddenly became extremely annoyed.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="216.html">« Prev</a><a href="218.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
