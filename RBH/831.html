She was the one who attacked me first, yet she had the audacity to question me. What was she trying to pull?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fox, we were just joking around, no need to take it so seriously, right? Here's to you." I raised my glass towards Lisa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remained still, sitting there with an air of defiance. "This face of mine was given to me by my parents, it's natural," she said. "Whether Ms. Mayers' face is natural or not, well, that's up for debate!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is she implying that I've had plastic surgery?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's simply spouting nonsense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't be bothered to keep up the facade of peace anymore. I slammed my glass down on the table, ice cold in my demeanor. "Aren't we all born this way, Ms. Fox? What exactly are you implying?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa suddenly stood up, looking at me with a mocking smile. "Well then, why don't you tell us, who's the ugly duckling and who's the swan?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly felt my temper flare up, ready to stand my ground, but Elliott subtly pressed my leg under the table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then said nonchalantly, "To me, Madeline is a person. Ms. Fox, you seem so conflicted. Could it be, you'd rather be a bird?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's words were soft-spoken, yet they carried a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement left everyone in the room utterly astounded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire room fell into silence in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip didn't dare to make a peep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Lisa hadn't expected Elliott to speak to her in such a manner, and it instantly riled her up. After a moment of silence, she finally sat down, her voice steady as she said, "Mr. Bryant, I mean no disrespect, but Ms. Mayers' words didn't sit well with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may be my client, but Madeline is my wife. Business can be abandoned, but marriage, that's for life. I hope you'll consider which is more important." Elliott's tone grew increasingly stern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, his hand found mine under the table, gripping it tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, I felt a tingling sensation in my palm, akin to a mild electric shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but stare at Elliott... He was actually defending me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to prioritize his clients above all else. He wouldn't bat an eye if I had to take a hit for a deal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Lisa is his client, and yet, he's willing to risk falling out with her for my sake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admit, I'm a bit smitten right now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, are you seriously considering ditching our freshly inked billion-dollar deal for Ms. Mayers? If so, I urge you to think it through! After all, our precious medicinal herbs never lack for buyers!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa was instantly enraged. She stood up, her eyes blazing red as she stared at Elliott, her gaze filled with hurt.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="830.html">« Prev</a><a href="832.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
