I don't know what they're up to, but I suspect it's Jade's doing," I said into the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, don't panic. Call the police first. I'll bring people over right away," Quinn said sternly over the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hung up and immediately dialed 110. Then, without hesitation, I rushed towards home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glory Group was relatively close to my house. When I burst through the door, the police hadn't arrived yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I pushed open the door to the living room, the bodyguard had already been knocked unconscious by them. And my mother was tied to a chair by several men.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These despicable individuals! They dared to target my mother, a woman nearing fifty, tore her clothes to shreds, gagged her with a towel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, one was busy taking pictures of my mother from different angles.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Jade knew I wouldn't back down anymore, so she intended to use humiliating photos of my mother to make me relent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, I had installed surveillance cameras at home. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what these bastards might have done to my mother!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom!" My heart shattered when I saw my dignified mother, now disheveled and bound to a chair, her clothes in tatters.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>a</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shouted, throwing caution to the wind, and rushed forward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs were taken aback, probably not expecting me to return at this moment. But when they saw it was just me, they immediately smirked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother desperately tried to make a sound, shaking her head vigorously. Through her eyes, I understood she was urging me to leave quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could I leave?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rushed forward, removing my suit jacket and draping it over my mother before embracing her tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want by intruding into a private residence?" I yelled at the thugs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another woman! This seems to be the same one we failed to kidnap last time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's practically delivered herself to us. We're really lucky. Last time we went through so much trouble to kidnap her, today we must make her pay for it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brothers, what are you waiting for, let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs discussed among themselves. And I instantly recognized two of them as the ones who tried to kidnap me last time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing I was alone, they swarmed me, grabbing my arms and throwing me to the ground. They pounced on me like hungry wolves, trying to tear my clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a tall man appeared at the doorway. He dashed forward incredibly fast, like a bolt of lightning, and reached me in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the thug about to leap on me could react, the figure delivered a fierce punch to his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man lifted me off the ground and held me tightly in his arms, while glaring coldly at the thugs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finally got a good look at his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had thought it was Quinn who had come to help. But to my surprise, the man who held me protectively was Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was both shocked and puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did he know something had happened at my home?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="318.html">« Prev</a><a href="320.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
