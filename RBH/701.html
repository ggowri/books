So, it kept moving slightly in my stomach, as if experiencing the pain in my heart along with me, and also comforting me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're wrong, Madeline. You said I didn't love you in the first ten years, and I admit it. But during the time you mentioned divorce, I genuinely liked you from the bottom of my heart and wanted to get to know you again. I truly wanted to be with you, can't you feel it?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's lips moved, his gaze incredibly deep, with a hint of love flowing in his eyes, and of course, there was also pain echoing within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled lightly, "You said it yourself. It's just a liking. Liking and love are different. Liking is when you start to be interested in something, while love is when you are willing to do anything for someone, even sacrificing your own life. Elliott, you can blame Giselle's child on your parents and Cormac, you can even say that your mother secretly arranged the divorce without your knowledge. But if you truly love me, there could have been a different way to handle Giselle and that child, and you would never have signed the divorce agreement. The fact that all of this happened only proves that you never loved me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about these things, my chest tightened suddenly, making it difficult to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned back on the chair, took a deep breath, and since I've said it, I might as well say it all, "I saw through it a long time ago, but in the past, I didn't want to expose it. I thought that as adults, we should be responsible for our own choices and there was no need to reach the point where we attack each other mercilessly. But now, you forced me to say all these, and this is the first and last time I will say these to you. Do you know that by repeatedly entangling me like this, trying to impress me with some tricks and tactics, in my eyes, you are simply not worthy of the ten years I've invested. If you truly understood me, you wouldn't have done this, which shows that you don't understand, and you never have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes noticeably became uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shocked, probably because I had never revealed these things in front of him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I admit, I really didn't know how to love someone. In the past, I never tried, and now, I am still searching for a way. The driver told me that women like men to pester them, so I..." he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver... Ha, I laughed in my heart instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Elliott's new driver turned out to be his emotional mentor, and he was really worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder his recent performance has been increasingly strange and outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're wrong. If someone truly loves another person, they don't need to find ways because love comes from the heart. Only possessiveness would drive someone to try </span><span>various methods to possess. Elliott, what makes you think that I would just wait for you? In the moments when you decided to accept Giselle's child, when you happily prepared for the birth of the child with her, when you decided to get engaged to her, you should have known that all the possibilities between you and me were slowly disappearing," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, I held my breath and all my emotions inside, looking directly into his eyes, and asked, "If it weren't for me exposing all of Giselle's lies at your engagement banquet, I'm afraid you would have been happily living with her by now, wouldn't you? Elliott, I am not something you can play with and discard at will. If you want to let go, then let go. If you want to salvage, then salvage. What am I to you all these years?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="700.html">« Prev</a><a href="702.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
