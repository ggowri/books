It seems like you still care about him. I'll spare his life for now, but if I don't see the money at the time and place I specified tomorrow, then I'm afraid this Mr. Woods will either lose his limbs or his organs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know who this crazy woman was, she was torturing Quinn so cruelly, and what's terrifying is that I knew absolutely nothing about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know that what you did is illegal? This is kidnapping and extortion. Are you really not afraid of me calling the police?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried hard to control my panic-stricken emotions and wanted to scare her a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't expect that she would laugh even more recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the police? Hahaha... Well, you can give it a try. I guarantee that if you call the police, not only will you not be able to save him, but you will also make his situation a hundred times worse than it is now. Besides, I am currently at the border, less than 6 miles away from Mexico. If you want Quinn to never come back, then of course, you can call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gasped in shock. I didn't expect her to be afraid of anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I can refrain from calling the police, but I am currently here in Norch City for tourism, and I cannot come up with ten million dollars in cash right now. I have an idea, though. If you provide me with an account, as long as you safely hand over Quinn to me, I promise to transfer all the money to your account."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that calling the police here might be futile, I started engaging with her, trying to gather as much information as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she laughed mockingly on the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I am not discussing a deal with you right now, but giving you a final warning. You have no room for negotiation, and you must do everything according to my instructions. Remember, if you deviate even slightly from my demands, I will immediately subject him to torture. I will continue to send you videos. Now, I have prepared one hundred water snakes for him to experience the taste of a water snake spa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the woman finished speaking, she let out a chilling laughter, and soon, the man's hysterical shouts came from the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held the phone, trembling all over. Quinn's agonizing screams made my heart feel as if it were being stabbed with a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shouted into the phone in a hurry, "Quinn! Quinn! Don't be afraid! No matter what, I will definitely save you! Hold on, you must hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, she cruelly hung up the phone, and in an instant, my surroundings returned to a dead silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a last glimmer of hope, I kept trying to dial Quinn's phone number, but the voice on the other end kept reminding me that his phone was already turned off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Quinn's phone was always on 24/7.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, his three-day disappearance is so bizarre, </span><span>and </span><span>then the man in the water dungeon is likely to be him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was brought up in a privileged manner since childhood, and he had never experienced such hardship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about that dark and terrifying water dungeon, and the one hundred water snakes lurking around him, I felt my whole body trembling. For a moment, I was so anxious that I paced around the room in circles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, someone suddenly knocked on my door...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="726.html">« Prev</a><a href="728.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
