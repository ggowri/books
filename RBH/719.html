Although her appearance was not outstanding, at that moment of her explanation, the radiance emanating from her whole body was truly dazzling and irresistibly attractive. I also instantly felt the strong professional female charm exuding from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, I have finished explaining. First, I would like to share my opinion. I believe that this project is feasible. I have visited Norch City several times a few years ago during business trips, and the unique climate there is indeed suitable for cultivating many scarce medicinal herbs. It is worth our effort to develop it. If the </span><span>company is interested in pursuing this area, I can go there for further investigation." After Jane finished her explanation, she directly expressed her own opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when she said that, Adam immediately agreed, "We don't really understand the medical field, and Jane is the most knowledgeable in this area. If she thinks it's feasible, then I have no objections. However, speaking of going to Norch City, didn't we mention last time that we wanted to expand? I actually think that going to Norch City at this time is a good choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Adam said this, the dull meeting room instantly became lively. Isaac, who rarely expressed his opinions, said, "Norch City is indeed nice, with good weather and great culture. We can consider going there for team building and also take the opportunity to conduct on-site inspections together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even workaholics like Isaac felt it was acceptable, and everyone immediately started expressing their own opinions one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also think it's possible. Because of the flu, I didn't go out much during the Spring Festival before. It's a good opportunity to go and relax."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agreed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had no objection either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Probably due to the previous flu, everyone had been staying at home for a long time. When Adam mentioned team building, everyone immediately agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the establishment of this new team, the initial period of adjustment in our work has already passed, and now it is indeed time to deepen our relationships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We went on a team building trip to Norch City... I hadn't thought about it before, but everyone thought it was a good idea, so I immediately agreed happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since everyone agrees, let's tentatively settle it this way. Adam, I'll leave this matter to you for arrangement!" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, I guarantee to complete the mission!" Adam immediately took charge, and upon hearing my decision, everyone's enthusiasm instantly soared even higher!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meeting, I returned to my office and Marcus was still sitting there leisurely drinking coffee. At the same time, he was also writing something on a white paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiously, I approached and discovered that it was his beautiful handwriting with a fountain pen, and what he had written was the poem that I had loved the most during my high school years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, how do you still remember this poem?" I was extremely surprised and couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I remember, back then you had a favorite poem. You even said that if you were to find a boyfriend in the future, he must be like the one described in that poem - not completely dependent on each other, but standing side by side in this world." Marcus lifted his head and looked at me with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a bit dazed, my thoughts were carried away by him, and for a moment, it felt like I was back in high school...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, back then the love I longed for was clearly a relationship of mutual dependence and independence, but later on, how did I end up losing myself so much in my love </span><span>for Elliott?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I remember. But Marcus, you reminded me once again today," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt more and more like I had found my original self. I looked at Marcus and smiled with satisfaction, then shook the project proposal in my hand. "Marcus, we have unanimously approved this plan and plan to go on a team-building trip to Norch City in the near future. Do you have any recommendations?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="718.html">« Prev</a><a href="720.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
