However, as I thought about her conversation with Quinn that night, I shook my head vigorously, trying hard to free myself from their world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to be disturbed by their affairs anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, I had more important things to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put down my phone and closed my eyes, trying my best to fall asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After staying at home to recover from my injuries for two days, I returned to work at the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the days when I was not present, the director's team had already finalized all the roles in the play one after another. At the same time, they have also finalized all the staff members of the crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam reported the situation to me one by one. I was pleased to hear that their efficiency was so high. Just as I was about to confirm the time to go to Louis City for shooting, Jade suddenly knocked on the door of my office, which I didn't expect at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you finally came to work today. I want to talk to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade wore an orange professional suit, tied her hair up in a high ponytail, and wore a pair of exaggerated fringe earrings. She stood in front of me with her arms crossed, looking imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her approaching aggressively, I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I opposed your choice of Audrey as the female lead in this play because she lacks both fame and background, and she is not professionally trained. She has always been just a supporting actor. Madeline, investment is not a game, we should not only consider ratings but also consider the box office returns. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at me with a clear disdain in her eyes. The implication behind her words was that I was fooling around and didn't understand at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the situation, I waved my hand and signaled for Adam to take action. Then, in a cold voice, I said, "Jade, my father has entrusted me with full responsibility for this matter, so I will decide who to use on my own. It doesn't seem like it's your place to interfere..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to regard Jade as my sister, and of course, I would obey her words. But now I won't let her manipulate me anymore, so I won't speak to her in the same tone as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade heard me say this, and her voice suddenly became loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's not that I want to interfere in your affairs, but I can't let you go wild with the shareholders' money like this. The initial investment for this play is estimated to be fifty million dollars, so if we include post-production and promotion, we will need at least a few hundred million dollars in funding. Do you know that if we choose the wrong leading actress, we could easily incur losses? How will you explain this to the shareholders later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade spoke with a stern tone, seemingly wanting to constantly show off her greater work experience compared to mine. However, I just chuckled and said, "I won't suffer any losses because I know what I'm doing. You should focus on managing your own projects first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I said all this today for your own good. If you continue to ignore my advice, then I will have no choice but to tell Austin. I won't let you continue to behave so recklessly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Jade decided to stick with me till the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished speaking and then directly pulled open the door of my office, slamming it arrogantly as she left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, I received a call from Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, come to my office."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="135.html">« Prev</a><a href="137.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
