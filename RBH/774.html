I have a method to remove it. But if he's been hexed, that's a different story. However, in all my years, I've only heard rumors of such witchcraft, never seen it in real life. I'll make a trip and see if my method works."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll be waiting for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hung up the phone, then relayed his words to Jack.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack was out of options. After hearing about Marcus's background, he agreed to let Marcus help Elliott out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hashing it out with Jack, I made my exit from his office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for that woman who bears a striking resemblance to me, I have no intention of meeting her face to face. For reasons unknown, I instinctively feel a bit uneasy about her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, as I stepped out of the elevator, there she was, hands in her pockets, standing there. She was looking in my direction, a subtle and enigmatic expression on her face. It was clear as day, she was waiting for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was utterly flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, standing face-to-face with someone who looks eerily similar to you, yet shares no blood or bond, is a truly bizarre experience.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that the other party had ill intentions, I had nothing to fear. I stepped forward, meeting her gaze head-on. I didn't speak, sensing that she seemed to have something to say to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Ms. Mayers."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello," I greeted with a slight nod.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you've decided to stay and take care of Mr. Bryant, I'll be heading back to Norch City. But, I reckon we'll cross paths again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cocked her head slightly, giving me a sidelong glance, her voice cool and detached.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Why do you say that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could tell there was more to her words than she let on. However, her calm departure took me by surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I believe, we are destined to cross paths."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She winked at me. There was an indescribable strangeness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In what way are we connected? I don't quite understand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her, asking coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flashed a smile, suddenly stepping up to my side, whispering softly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll understand in time, there's a long road ahead."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she swiftly stepped into the elevator, slamming the doors shut with urgency.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spun around, my gaze landing in her direction. As the elevator doors were about to close, I distinctly felt her smile freeze on her face. The look she shot my way was laced with an unnameable resentment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave me a sense of familiarity, as if we've known each other for ages. Yet, this was, in fact, our very first formal encounter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was utterly baffled, trying to figure out what on earth this woman wanted. Just then, Barry chimed in from behind me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just spoke with Ms. Fox, thanking her for taking care of Elliott recently. She mentioned that she has to rush back to Norch City for some business."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, how long has Mr. Bryant known her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I inquired.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It wasn't long ago. They met at the Entrepreneurs Summit in Norch City. She bore such a striking resemblance to you that Mr. Bryant asked for her contact information."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry spilled the beans.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, a strange feeling growing stronger within me. I had a vague sense that this woman was going to stir up some kind of storm in my life. But for now, she was like a fox lurking in the shadows, secretly watching me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her motives were unclear, her intentions were vague, and her actions were even more enigmatic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I'm powerless. All I can do is remind myself to stay on guard.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="773.html">« Prev</a><a href="775.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
