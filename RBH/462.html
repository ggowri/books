You two are not a match, so you should get divorced as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could speak, Quinn suddenly held my hand, looked at Elliott, and said with a serious look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood there. At that moment, he looked gloomy and sounded extremely cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you feel it? Madeline doesn't love you anymore. Because she loves me now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn emphasized again. And his words made me shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned for a few seconds, and then I quickly understood Quinn did this to let Elliott let me go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I will believe you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's body was slightly stiff, and his eyes were getting colder. However, he suddenly smiled coldly, and then raised his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was too proud to believe that a woman who loved him so much would suddenly fall in love with someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott and then at Quinn. At that moment, the arrogance in Elliott's look broke my defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admitted that he was like my inner demon in both my previous life and this life. I still couldn't resist his charm and would fall in love with him easily again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I didn't want to let myself fall in love with him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I liked being sober and independent, and I didn't want to fall into a relationship that had gone bad again. I didn't want to bet everything on a meaningless journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he didn't believe it, I should take some actions to make him believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I made up my mind. Before Quinn could react, I stood in front of Elliott, hooked Quinn's neck, and kissed his face without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's body visibly stiffened for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, do you believe it now? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After kissing Quinn's face, I pretended to be unsatisfied and leaned on Quinn's arms, staring coldly at Elliott and waiting for his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gradually lost hope and stared at me. There seemed to be complex emotions in his look, which made me tremble slightly for no reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Quinn knew my intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly came to his senses. He held my waist firmly. To make Elliott desperate, Quinn deliberately said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should have felt it, Madeline is obviously happier when she stays with me. Elliott, why don't you let Madeline stay with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn finished his words, Elliott's eyes turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he was enraged. His expression became more and more severe, and his eyes became more and more gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He directly punched hard towards the corner of Quinn's eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I exclaimed and subconsciously wanted to stop him, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't dodge, but he just smiled and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You make me sick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott growled, his hoarse voice showing that he was in pain. His voice echoed in the empty corridor as if the whole world had become quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if being greatly stimulated, Elliott clutched his chest tightly and walked away with particularly heavy steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked quickly, his heavy footsteps echoing in the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart was beating hard. The moment I saw him disappearing from the corner of the corridor, I seemed to have removed all my defenses, slumped against the wall weakly, and gasped for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just realized that my back was covered in cold sweat. The moment I leaned against the wall, I felt extremely cold on my back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn then let go of his hand. He looked at me and said distressedly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't go on like this. Madeline, would you blame me for making arbitrary decisions? "</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="461.html">« Prev</a><a href="463.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
