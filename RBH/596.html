Toby, usually good-natured, now appeared somewhat uneasy. Without waiting for me to speak, he said, "Mrs... Ms. Mayers, please, for my sake, don't hit Nicole."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby's tone was sincere and humble, momentarily softening my raging heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, during the years I was with Elliott, Toby had always been respectful and obedient towards me, always at my beck and call. If it weren't for Giselle becoming the third party in my relationship with Elliott, I would have been quite content with Toby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never asked anything of me before, and today, for the first time, Toby made a request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his demeanor, I nodded, withdrawing my hand from his grasp. I coldly remarked to Nicole, "I'll remember this slap today. If you dare to touch me again, you'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that said, I turned, grabbing Paige's hand, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You caused my daughter to go into premature labor. I never expected you to be so arrogant in front of me. Is having money all that matters? Does having money give you free rein to do as you please? Madeline, I will make you pay for what you've done, no matter the cost!" Nicole shouted hoarsely behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, I felt something rushed towards me. Just as I instinctively turned back, a husky voice sounded not far behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could comprehend what was happening, I felt a strong pull, causing me to lose my balance and fall backward. Yet, a steady hand caught me, and when I regained my senses, I found myself safely cradled in Elliott's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cry of pain echoed nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning back, I saw Nicole sprawled on the ground like a turtle, her agonized cries emanating from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Nicole had attempted to attack me from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott had pulled me away just in time, causing her to tumble to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his mother fall, Toby rushed forward in a panic, loudly asking, "Mom, are you okay? Are you hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole raised her head, clutching her mouth, blood staining her hand. I noticed a broken tooth on the ground. It seemed the force of her fall had caused her to knock out a tooth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to speak, but the pain from the broken tooth must have been too much. Nicole opened her mouth to speak, but only a muffled sound came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, standing nearby, couldn't help but chuckle at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood there in a daze for a few seconds. When I realized I was in Elliott's embrace, I quickly broke free and took a few steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should go back for now. We'll talk properly once things here are settled," Elliott said calmly, looking at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing to talk about. I wish you happiness. We're leaving," I said coldly, giving Paige a signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subsequently, the two of us swiftly linked arms and left the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained silent throughout the journey, only exhaling heavily when we passed through the hospital gates, feeling an indescribable heaviness in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige quietly held my hand, turning to me with a sympathetic look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be feeling terrible hearing about Giselle giving birth. Now the child is born, her connection with Elliott will only grow stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's their business, not mine. Elliott is a stranger to me now," I replied calmly, gazing at the deep blue sky.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="595.html">« Prev</a><a href="597.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
