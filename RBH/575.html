Suddenly, I noticed that the man looked somewhat familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deck lights were deliberately dimmed, so I gathered my courage and stepped closer to look. And as soon as I did, I was shocked to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip! What are you doing here?" I couldn't help but call out to the couple who were deeply engrossed in their kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face was buried in the woman's chest at that moment. I wasn't entirely sure it was Philip, but the moment I called out, he lifted his head in bewilderment, and I was sure it was indeed Philip!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip obviously hadn't expected to run into me. He stood there stunned for a moment, then immediately broke free from the woman's embrace in the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you... What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly stood up, frantically straightening his disheveled clothes. At the same time, he looked at me in panic, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never would have thought it was him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Paige was at home, heavily pregnant and struggling, he was here, cheating so shamelessly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was instantly consumed with anger, grabbing him by the collar without hesitation and demanding sternly, "Philip, what on earth are you thinking? Is this how you treat Paige? The woman who is carrying your child!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, who's this? Oh, what a killjoy," the elegant woman slowly sat up, calmly adjusting her dress, and softly interjected as if I was interrupting their "moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My blood boiled, and Philip glanced at the woman, then hurriedly pulled me aside, urgently saying, "Madeline, hold on, let me explain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to explain anything to me. I'm calling Paige right now, and you can explain it to her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious, I pulled out my phone from my pocket, ready to call Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, he panicked even more, hastily pushing me further into the corner of the deck. He whispered, "Madeline, please don't call Paige. I know I messed up. I shouldn't have let myself go like this, but Paige is in the late stages of pregnancy, and I couldn't hold it any longer. I swear, even though I physically strayed, my heart belongs to Paige alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip suddenly swore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Physically strayed, isn't that still cheating? What kind of scumbag behaves like this?" I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe my ears. Looking at the string of lipstick marks on Philip's neck made me feel sick, and my anger flared even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, Paige is carrying your child. You promised to take responsibility, but how can you be so irresponsible? If you were single, you could do whatever you wanted, but you're about to become a father. How could you do something like this behind Paige's back?" I couldn't help but confront him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip was about to say something when the woman he was just with unexpectedly came over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right before me, she shamelessly hooked her arms around Philip's neck, her seductive gaze glancing in my direction, her tone still languid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, who's this woman? Don't mind her. Let's continue our thing, shall we? I haven't had enough fun yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at this woman's face intently, memories involuntarily flashing back to the day I accompanied Paige home and saw a woman driving a Ferrari. She seemed to be the one in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, her face seemed oddly familiar, and I racked my brain trying to remember.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, it hit me like a ton of bricks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Jezebel, Giselle's close friend, and the female star that Bryant Group was promoting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe that she was involved with Philip!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="574.html">« Prev</a><a href="576.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
