Quinn naturally understood my meaning and quickly said, "Mom, there's no rush. Madeline and I will discuss our matters ourselves. Okay, you've been with us for the examination today, so you can put your mind at ease. It's getting late, let my sister take you home first. Madeline and I still have things to discuss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you wouldn't be thinking of shirking responsibility towards Madeline, would you? I'm warning you, the Woods family upholds a virtuous family tradition. Don't learn from Elliott." Carole grabbed Quinn's ear, coldly warning him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will certainly take responsibility for Madeline. Otherwise, why would I go to such lengths to inform you all? Alright, you take Mom home first," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn immediately removed Carole's hand, persuading Jessica and Carole with a mixture of coaxing and reasoning until they left the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching Jessica and Carole leave, I felt a sense of exhaustion as if the drama had drained me completely. I let out a heavy sigh, looking at Quinn with a wry smile. "Well, this whole thing was your doing. Tell me, how are we going to wrap this up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I thought of the possible repercussions, I suddenly felt uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it good the way it is now? My parents and family have accepted you, and they've accepted the child too. The child can come into this world rightfully. Isn't this the perfect ending?" Quinn shrugged, smiling at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until now that Fiona finally voiced the question she had kept to herself for so long. "But this child belongs to Elliott. Quinn, are you really so magnanimous, accepting this child and Madeline completely? Can you guarantee that you won't regret it in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, this was also a doubt in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up until now, the entire situation felt like a play to me, something I couldn't take seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I planned to remain unmarried for life, but now I want to get married. My parents are thrilled. Don't worry, I've thought everything through, and I won't regret it. Madeline, don't have any concerns," Quinn reassured in front of Fiona once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you plan to remain unmarried before?" Fiona asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Quinn remained silent, and his expression darkened as if the question had touched upon some heartbreaking matter he didn't want to bring up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at Quinn, I couldn't help but think of his first love he mentioned at the Carthage People's Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had only briefly mentioned the experience, I always felt like there was a knot in his heart, a knot that kept him seemingly carefree but truly living a lonely life all these years, holding onto the idea of remaining unmarried for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, I didn't know what that knot was about. I only vaguely felt that behind his cheerful demeanor, there seemed to be a past unknown to others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him silent, I didn't press further. After spending some time in Fiona's office, we left the hospital together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as we walked out of the hospital gate, I suddenly saw a familiar white Porsche parked not far away. Elliott was gallantly assisting Giselle towards the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze in place, staring fixedly at their backs as they approached the car. Then, Giselle suddenly stopped, pouting as if she were coquettish with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Elliott, in full view of everyone, lifted Giselle around the waist and gently placed her in the backseat. In that instant, my eyes stung, and my heart felt like it was being torn apart!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="542.html">« Prev</a><a href="544.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
