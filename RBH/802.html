He was clad in a dark business suit, one hand casually tucked in his pocket. His face was stern, standing before us with an imposing aura of masculinity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slightly taken aback, and the next second, I furrowed my brows and asked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you get here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a hint of annoyance in my tone, as my instincts told me that this couldn't just be a coincidence. Could it be that he had someone tailing me all along?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was devoid of any emotion, and then he just plopped down right next to me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had dinner with Quinn and didn't even think to invite me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing him call out "Quinn" so casually took me by surprise. But then it hit me - he had amnesia. He didn't remember his fallout with Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't utter a word, he simply flagged down the waiter and ordered a few more hot dishes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere suddenly became a bit delicate. The three of us sat together, none of us saying much, just quietly eating our meals.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was already stuffed. So, I barely touched the dishes that came later. I got up and made a trip to the restroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I returned, I was just about to step into the tent when I heard Elliott speaking to Quinn inside:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Name your terms," he said. "What will it take for you to stay away from my wife?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze, my steps abruptly halting. I wanted to eavesdrop, to find out what they were really talking about.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's voice chimed in at that moment:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, first off, Madeline is a person, not a possession, and she and I are just friends. So, there's no way I'm making any conditions. Secondly, if you truly love her, you should respect her, including all her decisions and who she chooses to associate with."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was standing outside the tent, so I couldn't see the look on Elliott's face after Quinn spoke those words. But I did hear a sudden noise coming from inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like the sound of Elliott slamming the table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were just a casual hangout between friends, I wouldn't bat an eye! But you, dining alone with Madeline, in such a romantic setting. Quinn, don't think I'm oblivious to your intentions. You, of all people, should know she's my woman!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was seething with rage in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without stepping into the tent, I could already sense the palpable tension brewing within.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was terrified they might start a fight. But just as I was about to step in, I heard Quinn's cool voice ring out again:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you treat her right, I can assure you, I won't overstep my bounds with Madeline. But if you fail her, if you break her heart, don't blame me for stepping in. Elliott, your love for her has always been based on your need for her. But not me, I just want her to be happy! That's the difference between you and me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words sent a profound shock through my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, what he's always emphasized to me is his desire for my happiness, for me to be myself, not to revolve my life around Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kindness towards me has always been the purest, devoid of any ulterior motives. But the more selfless he is, the more pressure I feel. I feel incapable of reciprocating his goodness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to make yourself sound so noble. Saying that only proves you don't truly love her, because real love is selfish. What you have is universal love."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott argued, his tone still laced with a hint of anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's when I walked into the tent. The moment I stepped in, their mouths snapped shut.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions remained eerily calm, as if nothing had just transpired.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you full? Want anything else?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn turned to me, questioning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm full. If you guys are done eating, let's get going."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want the tension that had just been as thick as a drawn bow to continue. So, I turned to Quinn and said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn signaled for the waiter, ready to settle the bill.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the waiter turned to Elliott, saying respectfully:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This gentleman has just purchased the item."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="801.html">« Prev</a><a href="803.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
