As if understanding something, he quickly turned and walked out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his dejected figure, an instinctual urge to chase after him surged within me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But behind me, a strong hand gripped me. Elliott's voice, raspy, questioned:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you're after Quinn Woods? What's the deal between you two?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's question snapped me back to reality.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, to Elliott, I'm his wife. If I were to chase after him now, it would definitely shock him. And if he faints again, things would only get worse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't overthink our friendship, I'm just trying to spare him the heartache."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to look at Elliott, speaking in a subdued tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finally let out a sigh of relief. He walked over, his hand cradling my head, gently pulling me into his embrace:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're just friends, don't act too concerned. There should be boundaries in human interactions. If you blur those lines, he might get the wrong idea."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott cast a glance at the sushi on the ground. He knew my preferences, understood that those were among my favorites, and naturally, he grasped Quinn's intentions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I got it. You can head back to work now! I have a meeting to attend shortly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still in a whirl of confusion, wishing he would leave promptly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kicking me out again, huh?! Now you understand why I didn't want you showing up at the office before, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, playfully pinching my nose, his face full of affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get it. But don't worry, I won't be as needy as I used to be."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quipped with a grin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wish you were still the person you used to be. Now, you're like the wind, slipping through my fingers no matter how hard I try to hold on."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Elliott lingered, planting a reluctant kiss on my forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, he strolled out of my office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched him step into the elevator, then returned to my office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam had already had all the sushi on the ground cleaned up. He looked at me, seemingly struggling to find the right words. Finally, he couldn't hold back and said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Quinn left just now, he seemed pretty down. Madeline, are you really considering getting back together with Mr. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't your concern, focus on your own tasks. Have you prepared the materials for the meeting as I asked?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm at a loss for how to explain it to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam stated:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm all set, ready to start the meeting. I just feel sorry for you. Quinn is such a great guy, once you miss him, he's gone."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot him a glare, not responding to his words, but instead, gesturing with my eyes for him to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat alone in my office chair, the image of Quinn's gaze and his utterly desolate silhouette haunting me. It felt as though my heart was being torn apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pulled out my phone, tapping on Quinn's icon, intending to explain things to him, but in the end, I just gave up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm at a loss for words.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="869.html">« Prev</a><a href="871.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
