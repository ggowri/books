I haven't done much for you from the time you were pregnant till you gave birth. Madeline, how's your recovery going? Do you still feel weak?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica tenderly took my hand. She was gentle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Jessica Woods, I'm pretty much back on my feet now. I'm doing okay, health-wise. Thanks for your concern."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I listened intently, a wave of emotion still spreading within me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having had a mother-in-law like Laura, I couldn't help but be deeply moved when I experienced the thoughtful care of Jessica.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, in this world, people truly are different from one another.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people, no matter how much you bend over backwards to please them, will still nitpick and boss you around, without giving you an ounce of respect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there are those, who, even though you've done nothing for them, still care for you as if you were their own family, cherishing you deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good to hear. Once you're feeling better, why don't you and the baby come stay with us for a while? Is Noah on breast milk or formula? Is it tough taking care of the baby?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica asked me with full of concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm swamped with work. He's off breast milk now, switched to formula. I've hired a nanny to look after him, and my parents are retired and home to help with the baby. Auntie, you don't need to worry. Noah is doing great. Whenever you have some free time, you're welcome to come over and see him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Carole chimed in:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's good that your parents can take care of you. My mom is just worried that there's no one around to look after Noah. Having a servant care for a child is not entirely reassuring, especially since Noah is so young. Madeline, you don't need to be formal with us. Since you're with Quinn now, your child is our child. If there's anything you need help with, just let us know. We're family after all."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole remained as candid as ever. Her conversations with her mother warmed my heart in a special way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in my eyes instantly. After having a child, it seems I've become much more emotional:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie, Carole, thank you for caring so much about Noah and me. I don't see you as outsiders. But Quinn has already done so much for me, how could I possibly trouble you further?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jessica gave my hand a pat, her face all lit up with a smile:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all family here, so there's no such thing as trouble. I know you're probably worried because Noah and Quinn aren't blood-related, and you fear there might be some resentment. But let me tell you, after you spoke your truth at our house that day, we had a family meeting about it. We unanimously agreed that as long as Quinn is okay with it, we're all for it. We're very open-minded people. Rest assured, we won't judge you in any way."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica's words left me awash with a myriad of emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I initially thought that after I laid my cards on the table that day at their place, they wouldn't bother with me once they knew the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their generosity, as vast as the ocean, was truly moving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Quinn is such a good-natured guy. It seems like it has a lot to do with the atmosphere in his family home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Homes like this, honestly, are few and far between. But the thing is, Quinn and I aren't exactly boyfriend and girlfriend. Their kindness towards me left me at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I choked up a bit, unsure of how to respond.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my state, Jessica wrapped me in a warm embrace. She patted my shoulder, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Auntie knows what's on your mind. We're here today to tell you, you don't have to worry about anything. Also, the Bryant family hasn't been giving you a hard time, have they? Today, when I saw the three of you standing together, Elliott didn't look too well. Has he been bothering you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="805.html">« Prev</a><a href="807.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
