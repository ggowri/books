I didn't plan to elaborate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, what kind of client? You</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>re alone with a client. Where's your assistant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Elliott dug deeper. He didn't just persistently interrogate me but also advanced towards me, a hand planted firmly against the wall behind me, cornering me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, this seems irrelevant to you, so maybe you shouldn't pry so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My head was still throbbing, my body </span><span>was </span><span>weak. I leaned against the wall, looking at him with a tone chilly and slightly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this none of my business?" Elliott clearly didn't appreciate my frosty demeanor. Lifting my chin, he asked, "Do you really need to be this cold?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smirked sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, "What kind of attitude should I have towards you? You and Giselle's baby </span><span>are</span><span> almost here. What else do you expect from me? Elliott, do you really expect me to accept all this graciously? Sorry, I can't do that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I spoke, Elliott's other hand slammed against the wall over my other shoulder with a smack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips seemed pale, whether from anger or something else, as his deep eyes </span><span>were </span><span>fiercely fixed on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want me to do? I've explained over and over that there's nothing between me and Giselle, but you don't believe me. You've never really trusted me, have you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face showed a hint of agony, and the strong smell of alcohol mixed with his breath as he spoke, hitting my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott indifferently. To be honest, at this point, I didn't even know what to say anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept saying there was nothing between him and Giselle. But a child couldn't suddenly come into the picture if there was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe him. I didn't want to get tangled up in this mess over and over again. I tugged at the corner of my mouth, opting to say the most hurtful thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, "Yes. I've never believed you. Elliott, you know? My love for you disappeared a long time ago. The only reason I slept with you was to amuse myself. We each got what we needed, and it was a way to provoke Giselle. Now that there's a child involved between you two, there's no need for me to play these games anymore. I'm tired. Let me go, and let yourself go, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glared at Elliott defiantly. As I hurled these words sharp as knives, I unexpectedly felt a surge of exhilaration in my oppressed and stifled heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps I had been restraining myself for too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps my love had been too humble all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps I had been too considerate of his feelings, repeatedly suffocating myself to the point of internal injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I treated my past love as nothing but hot air. This newfound freedom to let go without any reservations brought me an unprecedented sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could clearly see Elliott's face turn paler. He stared at me in disbelief, as if he couldn't fathom that these words were coming from me. His chest heaved dramatically, his eyes took on a mysterious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know Giselle's pregnancy has been complicated for you. But there's no need to lash out with these words. Madeline, you say you've stopped loving me. Huh, who would believe that? Are you saying everything written in your diary is a lie?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="430.html">« Prev</a><a href="432.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
