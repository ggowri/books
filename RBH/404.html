Shock and disbelief was written all over his face as he looked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swiftly, I rose from my seat, straightened my clothes, and chuckled lightly at his disheveled state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not your toy to be used for release, Elliott. Don't think you can treat me with the same approach every time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that cold remark, I disregarded his current suffering and exited the car without a second glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, a blast of cold wind greeted me, refreshing my foggy mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing back at the car, I caught a glimpse of Elliott's somber face through the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was suffering from pain, he likely had no intention of chasing after me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, he deserved it for trying to do things to me against my wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but smirk inwardly, feeling oddly satisfied amidst the suffocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stepped out of the hospital gates, preparing to hail a cab when suddenly, a car behind me honked twice in quick succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to see a green Lamborghini. As the window rolled down, Quinn's handsome face peered out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you off to? Come on, I'll give you a ride!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn whistled at me, maintained his usual carefree demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him, I wanted to ask if the information he gathered aligned with Elliott's claims. So, I promptly took the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, who typically kept a low profile, rarely drove such a flashy car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he sported a supercar and wore a suit. It seemed like he was attending an important event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, here he was, gathering a group of people for my family's affairs. Surely, it must have disrupted his plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling apologetic, I expressed my regrets to him as soon as I got in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did my family's matters inconvenience your plans today, Quinn? I'm sorry for always causing trouble for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense. I'm happy to help. Besides, those gatherings are dreadfully dull. I was just waiting for an excuse to slip away," Quinn replied nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his dismissive tone, his attire today hinted that things might not be as simple as he claimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to my suspicions, Quinn's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His phone was connected to the car's Bluetooth, and as soon as he answered, a woman's voice filled the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, where are you? How dare you disappear on me during such an important event tonight? Do you realize how awkward it is for me without you? You're already an adult, so can't you be more reliable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's tone and words were sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not as dramatic as you make it sound, like this household can't function without me. A friend of mine had an unexpected emergency, and it wasn't intentional on my part. I'll make it up next time," Quinn said, still maintaining his indifferent tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time? You think there'll be a next time? Get ready to face the music! Useless guy, I don't feel like wasting my breath on you! You better come back right now and apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman yelled again before abruptly hanging up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time I'd seen Quinn being scolded so harshly, and given his usual temper, he'd usually fire back. But today, instead of arguing back, he hung up the phone and couldn't help but smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was curious and asked, "Who's this fierce woman? You seem a bit scared of her."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="403.html">« Prev</a><a href="405.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
