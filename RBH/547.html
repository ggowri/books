As long as I recognize the child, they won't say anything. My intention is to give Madeline more confidence to continue her future life. Also, by doing so, we can avoid future interference from the Bryant family in Madeline and the child's life. What do you think?" Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn remained sincere, and by now, Austin had calmed down. He took a sip of water Lily handed him, then slowly turned to Quinn. "Quinn, I appreciate your sincere concern for Madeline and your thoughtful consideration. However, marriage is no child's play, especially when it involves a child. You're still young, and I don't want you to make such a rash decision. There are too many variables in the future. In my opinion, let's discuss this matter later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After much deliberation, Austin expressed his opinion. Quinn answered, "I understand. Don't worry, I will keep my word. From now on, you can judge me by my actions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn remained resolute, showing no signs of backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Marcus sat quietly, listening. He didn't say much, but he looked deeply into my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I met his gaze, I felt a vague sense of melancholy emanating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of what Quinn said, Austin remained steadfast in his position. In the end, he advised Quinn to consider the matter carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Quinn and Marcus left one after the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they left, Lily immediately pulled me aside, asking what was going on between Quinn and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I explained to her everything that had happened during this time in Carthage, along with Quinn's care for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, she fell into a long silence. After a while, she said, "I can feel that Quinn's concern for you comes from the bottom of his heart. However, this matter is too significant and involves many issues. As parents, we can't stand by and watch you make the same mistake twice. Madeline, you need to understand our genuine concerns."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could see deep concern for my marriage in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, I could understand their feelings well. Although Quinn was willing to take responsibility for my future, our relationship was not based on genuine love between a man and a woman. So, I also had reservations and dared not make any hasty decisions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with mom for a while, I went back to my room. After taking a shower, I leaned against the headboard, absentmindedly scrolling through my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I scrolled through Instagram casually, I came across a post from Elliott. There was no caption, just a picture of a bunch of alcohol. Judging by the background, it seemed to be in a dimly lit private room or bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but recall his tender care for Giselle today, which brought a slight pang of bitterness to my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it, Elliott and I were in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid feeling bothered, I stared at his profile picture for a long time, subconsciously wanting to press the delete button to remove him from my friends list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I hesitated, Alexis suddenly sent me a video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clicked it, and inside was a clear recording of Elliott talking...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="546.html">« Prev</a><a href="548.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
