Did Quinn want his family to misunderstand that I was pregnant with his baby?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way! How could he do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was unmarried and the only son of the Woods family. Did he ever consider how much of a shock his speech and actions would be to his parents and family?&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of this, I tried to speak up again, but Quinn, as if he knew what was in my mind, grabbed my hand in front of Carole and said, "Carole, Madeline and I are truly together. Now that she is pregnant, I will be responsible for her. I hope you and our parents can understand and support us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was very serious, as if the baby in my belly were really his. His eyes were clear, showing no trace of falsehood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Carole froze in place, staring at Quinn and me with her beautiful, piercing eyes, as if she were looking at aliens.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long have you two been together? Quinn, I'm warning you not to make fun of your marriage! If you dare to screw with me, there will be consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole wasn't ready for this. Even though Quinn appeared solemn, she couldn't help but think that Quinn must be joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carole, you're right. Quinn is kidding. Don't believe..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was afraid that if Quinn went on like this, things would escalate, so I hastened to explain the situation as Carole had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Quinn continued, "I'm not joking. I'm serious. Carole, you should know that I'll joke about anything, but my marriage is no laughing matter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's sudden seriousness stunned Carole. The next moment, there was a tremor in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really serious? Do you and Madeline already have a baby? Are you sure? Quinn, I'm warning you, again and again, this matter is not a small matter for the Woods family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole became incredibly grave at this moment. It was clear that she believed Quinn's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said I'm serious. Go back and tell our parents. If they want, I can take Madeline back to meet them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Quinn took my hand firmly, and there was a great deal of resolution in his words.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart skipped a beat. I couldn't help but look back at Quinn deeply. I had no idea why he was doing this. All sorts of emotions swept over me, and my brain went blank.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-You caused such trouble! You're doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole pointed at Quinn with trembling fingers. Despite her strong desire to punch him, she ultimately refrained from doing so and stomped her feet in anger instead. Then, Carole turned around, left the ward, and ran straight out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after Carole's departure, I shook Quinn's hand off and asked incredulously, "Why did you lie to Carole? Are you crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn turned to me and was about to say something when the light in the ward suddenly dimmed. Immediately afterward, I saw a familiar figure standing in the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Quinn could defend himself, Elliott's cold voice had already come through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, is everything you said true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if Elliott had heard an incomparably big secret, with a long face, he glared at Quinn and me, his deep eyes icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I completely froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Elliott didn't leave and even remained stationed at the ward's doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he had heard all of our conversation.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="529.html">« Prev</a><a href="531.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
