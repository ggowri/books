Since you dare to post those photos on Instagram, tell me, what do I want to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained angry, his face as black as coal. But strangely, while others looked unattractive when angry, the angrier he became, the sharper, more majestic, and more captivating his face appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I just have the freedom to post on Instagram?" I don't know why he has been arguing with me about these ambiguous things. To be honest, I'm a bit tired. I said lightly, "Actually, I think these past few days have been quite good. You don't contact me, I don't contact you. This kind of life is what you want, and it's also what I want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with shock in an instant, and he pinched my chin and looked at me, his tone incredulous. "You want this kind of life, Madeline? You deliberately want to provoke me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott squeezed my chin with great force, causing me immense pain. I looked at him, feeling puzzled by his words and actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's really good that we don't have any contact with each other... These days, I have felt unprecedented happiness, and without my interference, he can go on dates with Giselle however he wants. He should be very happy, logically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what you used to wish for the most, wasn't it for me to not contact you or bother you? Maybe I couldn't do it before, but don't worry, from now on I can definitely do it, really, you don't have to be annoyed anymore," I said patiently, while trying to push away his hand that was pinching my chin, because it was really hurting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But little did I know, this jerk, for some reason unknown, suddenly had a wire crossed in his brain. Just as I finished expressing my indifference, he unleashed his pent-up desires like a wild beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forcefully pressed me against the wall, without saying a word, and fiercely kissed my lips. His tongue was extremely dominant and forcefully pried open my lips, leaving me no room to catch my breath. He crazily blocked all of my breath!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I, who had never experienced such a fierce attack before, was completely unable to withstand such an onslaught for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind went blank in an instant, and my whole body became extremely stiff. I instinctively pressed my hands against the wall to maintain my balance, but little did I know, this guy was relentless, as if he had taken drugs, showing no signs of letting me go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that I couldn't stand steady, he unexpectedly wrapped my legs around his waist. Then, swiftly, he switched positions with me, leaning against the wall while holding me in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the entire process, his lips never left mine for a moment. He continued to advance, while I had no choice but to retreat. I allowed him to desperately seek kisses, like a madman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was just sober, I am 100% sure, he didn't take any drugs this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is he doing now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed me so urgently, he disregarded everything and held me in his arms, he attacked me crazily, trying to invade every cell of my body, why was he so crazy?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="143.html">« Prev</a><a href="145.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
