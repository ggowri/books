Let's not dredge up the past. Sean, take good care of yourself, alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I responded nonchalantly. I had no desire to utter that name again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, you've lost a lot of weight, Ms. Mayers. I heard you were expecting... Where's the baby?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean cast a glance at my belly, then cautiously asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From pregnancy to childbirth, I didn't really gain much weight. Plus, after giving birth, I maintained a regular diet and didn't fancy greasy food, so overall, I didn't put on much weight. In fact, I'm a bit lighter compared to before I got pregnant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Sean suddenly brought up the subject of children, I was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a message from Elliott popped up, saying he'd whipped up breakfast and I could head downstairs to grab a bite.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't respond to Sean's words, instead, I shifted the topic. I filled Sean in on Elliott's current situation, urging him to take extra care of Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, I was concerned that Sean might misconstrue my intentions, thinking I wanted to reconcile with Elliott. So, I made it clear to him that my current communication with Elliott was solely for the purpose of aiding his medical treatment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After explaining it to him, I headed downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Downstairs, Elliott was busy setting a surprisingly lavish breakfast on the table. I took a quick peek and found an array of treats - pastries, purple yams, perfectly fried sunny-side-up eggs, and two glasses of milk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fried egg he cooked this time looked really appetizing. Compared to before, he has truly made a lot of progress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that after we parted ways, he must have been cooking for himself quite a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a seat and dig in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me descend, Elliott flashed me a warm smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, settling myself at the dining table. I took a sip of the milk, finding it at just the right temperature... When did he start paying such close attention to these little details?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We sat down, face to face. I could feel his gaze on me, so intense that it made me eat with a certain restraint.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pinched off a piece of pastry and gave it a taste, then devoured a poached egg, and finished off the milk in my cup. Then, I stood up and said to him:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for the breakfast, I'm heading out for work now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott rose to his feet in an instant, his slender fingers naturally crossing over his chest. He lifted his gaze and asked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you be coming home tonight? If you are, I'll come back early to prepare dinner for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between making breakfast and cooking dinner, it's as if Elliott has become a whole new person, isn't it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, "I'll be heading to my folks' for dinner tonight. My mom's got my meal all planned out. So, I won't be coming back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh," he said, a hint of disappointment clear in his voice, "It's been a while since I've seen your folks. How about I bring some gifts and pay them a visit tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't see it coming, him making such a demand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't this a tough one for me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If my folks found out I'm back with Elliott, they'd probably break my legs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he's currently suffering from amnesia. For a moment, I was at a loss for words, unsure of how to respond. So, I found myself dodging the question, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do it another time. Tonight, I want to have a chat with my parents about the Glory Group. It's not convenient for us to talk about it with you around."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then... I'll swing by your place tomorrow morning and we can head to work together."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Elliott would have given up by now. Surprisingly, he's been pretty persistent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but slightly furrow my brows, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I have my own car. It's more convenient for me to drive to and from work."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why do I get the feeling that you're resisting being with me? You weren't like this before. Did I do something wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My repeated rejections left Elliott puzzled, a hint of hurt lacing his tone.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="797.html">« Prev</a><a href="799.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
