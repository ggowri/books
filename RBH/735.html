During my three years in the </span><span>military, I encountered many situations even more dangerous than this, so don't be afraid. No matter what happens, I will definitely protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and said in a deep voice, "Hmm, I wasn't afraid. Since I came here, there's nothing that can scare me. My only thought now is to find a way to rescue Quinn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can definitely rescue him! Based on my experience, the woman's intention should be to get that sum of money, but she doesn't want to reveal her true identity. If she only wants money, then we should do as she says. There shouldn't be too big of a problem," Jane analyzed calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now we knew nothing about their situation. What if we put the money where they asked, as they said, and Quinn doesn't release it?" I said worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is indeed a frightening issue that we are facing, but for now, we have no other choice but to wait for Dehan's update."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Jane finished speaking, my phone started ringing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I saw that it was a call from Dehan, I hurriedly answered it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the number that called you, we traced her location. She is now not within Norch City, but inside a park in Mexico. The park is called 731 Group, which appears to be an electronic technology park on the surface, but in reality, the people there are involved in activities such as extortion, organ trafficking, and the like. The woman who contacted you is named Delin Qynn, and she is notorious for being cunning and ruthless. Anyone who is kidnapped by her, even if they don't die, will be tortured and left disabled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Dehan said on the phone made my heart instantly tense to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I never had any dealings with such people at all, let alone offend them. Why would they treat me and my friends like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I heard what he said, I realized that it had nothing to do with me at all, so I asked him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think carefully, have you offended anyone recently?" Dehan asked me on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first person that came to my mind was Giselle, but then I realized she had already jumped into the sea, so it was impossible for her to do these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought and thought, and I felt that this must be related to the agreement I signed with Dalton. However, I had just signed the agreement, and they acted so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even if they wanted to retaliate, they should retaliate against me, but why would they do this to Quinn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much I thought about it, I couldn't come up with a reason, but I still told Dehan about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing my words, Dehan pondered for a few seconds and then said, "It is highly likely that it is related to your investment in this film. If that's the case, you better contact the director and find out exactly which Mexican force they have offended, whether it's the 731 Group. This will also facilitate our intervention to rescue Quinn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Dehan's words, I immediately said into the phone, "Alright, I will contact Dalton right away."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="734.html">« Prev</a><a href="736.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
