Do you want me to resort to force right here in the office?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept over my collarbone, and with a sudden jerk, Elliott forcefully ripped off the last remaining button on my navy V-neck suit jacket, leaving it hanging by a thread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath the jacket, only a white lace-trimmed camisole remained, now fully exposed to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the fuller curves of my pregnancy-enhanced bosom surprised him, igniting an insatiable desire in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the situation was escalating, I quickly shielded my chest, but Elliott, like a wild beast unleashed, grabbed the back of my head and forcefully invaded my lips with his tongue, disregarding any boundaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling deeply insulted, I bite him mercilessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott cried out in agony, instinctively covering his mouth with his hand. Seizing the opportunity, I broke free from his embrace, swiftly stepping back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Elliott rose to his feet, seemingly intent on approaching me again, I grabbed the ashtray from his desk and shouted, "Elliott, if you dare touch me again, I'll smash your head."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, consumed by anger and an inexplicable sense of shame, I felt a fiery rage ignited within me, which caused a dull ache in my lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my resolute stance, Elliott seemed to awaken from his lustful haze, his gaze gradually clearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you truly despise me this much now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Don't touch me again, I feel sick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the pain from his bite made it unbearable for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood there, hands wavering, looking at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe you've truly fallen for Quinn. It seems unlikely to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the ashtray defensively, I stared coldly at him. "Time will tell, Elliott. I'm not here today to discuss our feelings. Please adjust your attitude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me some time. Once Giselle's child is born, I'll immediately send them both abroad. I promise they won't interfere with us. As for your plans, I'll fully support them. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring my words, Elliott continued to offer compromises and concessions, but it was too late now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only he had made such decisions decisively when I was unsure in the beginning, perhaps there would have been a chance to salvage our relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, hearing these words, I felt no emotional ripples, confirming that I had truly let go of any feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, it's pointless to say these things now. Don't waste your breath."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head resolutely, looking at him with unwavering determination.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="588.html">« Prev</a><a href="590.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
