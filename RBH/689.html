Therefore, I cannot take even the slightest risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that if I continued to stand for much longer, I might not be able to hold on, and having just confessed to Quinn, it was impossible for me to go back and ask him to see me off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I thought for a few seconds and ultimately chose to get in Elliott's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting on the car, there was a moment of silence in the carriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver skillfully maneuvered the steering wheel. I noticed that the driver had been changed, and it was no longer Toby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott coughed lightly and said, "At this time, you should have gone to the Woods villa for dinner, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't Quinn come out to see you off? Did you have an unpleasant meal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's deep eyebrows slightly arched, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you guys have a fight? I guess his parents didn't agree, right? The Woods family is known for having high expectations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott furrowed his brow and let out a light chuckle. This laughter was unexpectedly tinged with a hint of smugness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you done or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard the sarcasm in his tone and retorted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just find it strange that Quinn claimed to treat you well. You rarely go to his house for a meal, but he didn't even offer to drive you there! He is indeed untrustworthy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had a slight smile on his face, and his gaze occasionally swept over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't look at him, but I could feel the burning gaze in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I coldly responded, "He was busy. Besides, what happened between him and me doesn't seem to concern you, Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just find it strange," a faint hint of mockery flashed in Elliott's eyes. He suddenly leaned closer to me, "Could it be that you guys are pretending?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still testing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I repeatedly proved in front of him that Quinn and I were in a romantic relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he seemed to have seen through it. He leaned in close to my ear. His breath brushed against my ear, causing my heart to instinctively flutter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I truly regretted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I should not have gotten into his car just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively dodged to the other side and said, "Can't we have an argument? Arguing can actually strengthen the relationship between a man and a woman. Don't you understand? Who says that two people must always be together when they are in a relationship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott laughed even more mischievously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he still argue with you even when you were pregnant? So, he claims to be a good man like this? It seems that this child has nothing to do with him, that's why he doesn't care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was not so noisy before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why has he become so talkative and gossip-loving now? Does he have to pry into other people's privacy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to say?" I got a little angry. "Stop at the intersection ahead. I want to get off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, come back to me. I wouldn't treat you with such inconsistency. Quinn is really not right for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, seemed completely indifferent to what I said. He leaned in again, lifting my chin, his voice seductive.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="688.html">« Prev</a><a href="690.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
