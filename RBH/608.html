He just wanted to express his care, but at this moment, he made everyone feel depressed, and no one could cruelly answer him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I signaled to Quinn with my eyes, indicating him not to ask anymore. The nurse started urging us to push Paige into the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip remained standing on one side of the hospital bed like a wooden man. I pushed him aside. Afterward, Quinn and I quickly pushed Paige into the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on my expression and Paige and Philip's attitude, Quinn had already realized something. He looked at me with confusion. When he saw the answer in my eyes, he appeared shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip silently followed us. I noticed that he occasionally wiped away tears. He was very disheartened. He looked weak when he walked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that he just didn't have control over himself, not that he didn't care about the baby in Paige's belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paige could not tolerate his mistake. She would rather terminate her child's life prematurely than be with Philip again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to the ward, although Paige was very weak, she grabbed Quinn's arm and eagerly asked, "How did the police plan to deal with that despicable woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Police made a record, detained her, but did not tell me what will happen next," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Quinn's words, Paige instantly became excited. She strongly accused, "Why? She is the murderer. She caused me to have a miscarriage! Madeline, Quinn, you must help me. I want that woman to pay for my child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was receiving an infusion, she still held onto Quinn with one hand and held my hand with the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was afraid that she would act impulsively. So, I quickly reassured her, "Paige, calm down. Right now, you only need to take care of yourself. Don't worry. We will definitely help you make that bitch pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you knew some journalists. Contact them and tell them to report on the incident where Jezebel caused me to have a miscarriage. This way, she won't be able to stay in the entertainment industry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige remained very excited. She couldn't calm down. She only had hatred for that woman in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, don't think about this any longer. Rest well, okay? What would you like to eat? I'll go buy it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip stepped forward, extending his hand, and gently touched Paige's forehead with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paige pushed his hand away disdainfully and said angrily, "Go away! Stop acting. I think you're disgusting. Philip, are you worried about that cheap woman? Even if we break up, you and that cheap woman can never be together. Stop dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't. Paige. I just wanted to be with you. The three of us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Philip appeared to be in great pain. When he said "the three of us", he couldn't help but choke up. He couldn't continue speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked sincere. I didn't think he was acting.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="607.html">« Prev</a><a href="609.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
