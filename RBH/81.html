Paige is also here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly replied to me again and sent me a photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the photo, he and Paige were singing with a group of people. Paige was dressed very sexy and was holding a bottle of beer, drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't go, you take care of Paige, make sure she is safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw Paige like this and felt a little worried, so I quickly replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Okay, don't worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn replied to me quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned his head at that moment, just as I finished chatting with Quinn, but evidently, he had already seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a clearly displeased expression on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you two often chat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not often, occasionally," I said truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want you to get too close to Quinn," he said calmly, suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I, to be honest, didn't really get close. I felt like we were just ordinary friends, and I don't know why Elliott was so concerned about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's still enjoy the moon quietly, this red velvet cake is good, try it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moonlight was beautiful tonight, and I didn't want to waste time on such annoying topics. So I said, and I casually put a piece of red velvet cake into my mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom didn't deceive me, this red velvet cake was indeed delicious, and, it wasn't greasy at all, very sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was eating when Elliott suddenly asked, "Weren't you always wanting a child before? If you can stop arguing with me, we can start trying for a baby by the end of the year."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost choked, almost unable to swallow a bite of red velvet cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly gulped down several mouthfuls of water, which finally suppressed the shock in my heart. I turned my head to look at him, feeling even more convinced that I couldn't understand him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Did he really say to me so seriously that I want a child is just a dream?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you suddenly change your mind and want to have a baby with me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have changed my mind now. I want to work hard and I don't want to think about having children for the time being."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said to him seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was feeling a bit unhappy. He turned his head to look at me, his sharp gaze filled with a hint of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What were you thinking now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said that we didn't need to make the relationship so tense. Maybe we could find a different way to get along well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott reiterated once again, and his tone sounded particularly sincere, as if he had truly pondered over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't think so. I suddenly sat up from the chair and looked at him, asking in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of way? As siblings? Well, that's not impossible either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had just picked up a slice of watermelon when my words choked him, almost causing the entire piece of fruit to get stuck in his throat.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="80.html">« Prev</a><a href="82.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
