Hearing a noise, she immediately poked her head out of the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You woke up, huh? Hurry up and freshen up. I saved breakfast for you, waiting for you to get up and eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Lily walked out of the kitchen with the bread, coffee, and steamed purple sweet potatoes that she had made herself, and placed them in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I was eating, I asked, "Mom, did you help me change my pajamas last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to my growing belly, I felt hungry more frequently lately, and my appetite has become better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you were pregnant and still playing with them until late at night. You can't do that anymore. But Quinn is really considerate of you. Last night, he carried you upstairs like a child. I wanted to wake you up, but he didn't agree. He said you haven't had a good night's sleep in a long time and wanted you to rest well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily described the situation from last night. Upon hearing her say that, I had mixed feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, why was he so good to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blurted out subconsciously. As a result, Lily, upon hearing me say that, couldn't help but laugh and cry, and she tapped my head with a fork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else could it be? Of course, it's love. In my opinion, his feelings for you were much deeper than that jerk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Lily found out about Elliott's engagement with Giselle, she has been referring to him as a "jerk" instead of using his name directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Lily's eyes, anyone who harmed me was an irreconcilable enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what is love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's words, however, immediately plunged me into confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I thought I knew what love was, so I filled that diary with love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, after ending that relationship, I realized that I never really understood love. In the past, I just loved for the sake of love, blindly, and ended up hurting myself </span><span>deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Love is to be good to someone without reason, just like Quinn is to you. Madeline, if Quinn can truly treat this child as his own after it is born, then consider being with him. He is someone worth spending your life with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily looked at me and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words, however, made me slightly startled. My face involuntarily turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what are you talking about in the early morning? I don't want to be in a relationship now, let alone get married. I just want to focus on having the baby and living a good life with you, and running Glory Group well. As for everything else, let's talk about it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your father and I have both grown old. If there isn't someone who genuinely takes care of you, how can we be at ease? Besides, you're about to have a child soon, and you need someone to accompany you even more. Listen to my advice, don't always be so stubborn about love, desperately chasing after someone you shouldn't. Why not cherish the one who cares for you? It's a big taboo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily immediately persuaded me. There was a faint glimmer of tears in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but raise my head and glance at her. However, I suddenly noticed that she, who had always been conscious of her appearance, had a few strands of white hair at her temples. Moreover, her complexion seemed much worse than before...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="660.html">« Prev</a><a href="662.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
