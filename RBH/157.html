You could have just instructed someone to handle this kind of thing, and besides, Giselle is quite diligent and responsible. You can rest assured. It's still under construction here, messy and dirty. You should go back first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head and said firmly, "Safety is not a trivial matter. This exposition is being watched by the whole world, and there can't be any mistakes in any aspect. Especially with this heavy rain still not stopping, I want to ensure that the materials you are using won't have any issues. Jimmy, come with me for a round of inspection, just in case, let's double-check."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Ms. Cole, just a moment, let me give some instructions first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimmy saw that I insisted and didn't dare to argue too much. He immediately went to instruct his subordinates about some matters, and then he accompanied me to start inspecting the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain was indeed getting heavier, but luckily, I had changed into lightweight clothes and put on sneakers when I came back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, my shoes quickly got wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle fetched me a safety helmet and a raincoat. After putting them on, I, along with Giselle, Jimmy, and a few of Jimmy's henchmen, walked around the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimmy obviously thought that I didn't understand these things and planned to take me for a casual walk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I vaguely remember that in the previous life, the reason for the safety hazard was that they had piled up a lot of debris on the top of the greenhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after taking a round of inspection downstairs, I said to Jimmy, "Jimmy, let's go up to the top of the shed and have a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? But it's already getting dark now, and the rain is getting heavier. It's very dangerous up there, and it's easy to slip and fall. Ms. Cole, you are so delicate, it's better not to go up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimmy looked embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me there immediately, I won't feel at ease if you don't see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't waste any more time with Jimmy and asked him to take me to the top of the greenhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The greenhouses in this venue all adopt a grid structure. First, pillars are used to support the grid, and then panels are laid on top of the grid. This kind of structure is strong enough in the short term, and most convention centers also use this structure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when we went up to the top to take a look, I discovered that in the corner of the hall, someone had piled up a heap of pumice stones on the roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I saw that pile of pumice, I immediately understood where the danger of collapse lay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of pumice has many small holes on its surface, making it extremely absorbent. When it encounters water, it becomes heavier. And this heavy rain has been going on for so long, these pumice stones have already absorbed a lot of water, and their weight must be several times heavier than before. If they are not moved in time, once the weight exceeds the load-bearing capacity that the pillars and framework can support, it will inevitably cause the collapse of the pavilion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the large-scale exhibition starts, there will definitely be countless people flooding in. If the pavilion collapses, the consequences will undoubtedly be devastating. Even a massive corporation like Bryant Group may not be able to bear such consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Elliott was so good to Giselle in the previous life and even gave her such a nice apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering the serious consequences, Elliott must have been very grateful to Giselle in his heart, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in this lifetime, I will not give Giselle such an opportunity again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jimmy, is that piled up there perlite?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pointed at the pile of pumice stones and deliberately asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jimmy nodded quickly, until now he hadn't realized the problem. He said, "Yes, they had nowhere to put them, so they temporarily piled them here and will take them away once the rain stops."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="156.html">« Prev</a><a href="158.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
