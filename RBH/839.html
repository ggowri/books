You need to stop worrying about me so much. Just focus on your little grandson now, spend quality time with Noah and Dad. You don't need to think about anything else. How about this? I'm free the day after tomorrow evening. I'll call the Woods family and invite them to dinner at the newly opened Hoswich Hotel, sound good?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, you handle it as you see fit."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly reached out to Jessica. Upon hearing that my family was inviting hers over for dinner, Jessica readily agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hoswich Hotel is a recent addition to the scene, serving up a variety of local delicacies and snacks that are unique to Hoswich city. The ambiance is charmingly vintage and the flavors are authentically local. Since its opening, it's been drawing in crowds, particularly appealing to the older generation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was pretty good that day. My parents, wanting Quinn's folks to meet Noah, had specially brought him along in his baby carrier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This encounter, for me, wasn't about two sets of parents meeting. It was simply our way of expressing gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a token of my gratitude, I specifically purchased a pearl necklace for Jessica.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jessica, I had this pearl necklace picked out just for you. It suits your elegance perfectly. What do you think? Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the dinner party, I handed my carefully selected gift to Jessica.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was taken aback, hastily declining, "Madeline, why on earth are you giving me such an extravagant gift? I can't accept this. Buying things for Noah is just a small token of our affection as elders. You're being too polite. We're practically family now, aren't we, Lily?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom was all smiles, her cheeks flushed a rosy red. She had quite a bit to drink that night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he taken a seat, than the elders had already downed quite a few drinks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was a local of Hoswich city and all were in business, so even though it was their first meeting, the atmosphere was lively. Especially between Lily and Jessica, they hit it off so well, they were practically becoming sisters.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jessica, please accept what Madeline has bought for you. It's a token of her respect as a younger generation. Madeline always tells me how much Quinn takes care of her, and how understanding you all are towards her. As a mother, it warms my heart to hear that others are treating my child well. Jessica, I only have this one daughter. If she's happy, we're happy. If she's suffering, we suffer too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lily spoke, her words became more emotional, her eyes brimming with unshed tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words inexplicably made me want to cry. I knew it was the jovial scene of the evening that reminded her of everything I had gone through with the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, I was out of favor with Elliott, and they even looked down on my parents.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I recall one New Year, my folks had painstakingly prepared gifts well in advance. They had put a lot of thought into selecting seafood and various local specialties to deliver to the Bryant Villa. However, not long after they had delivered them, everything was sent right back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura had the audacity to send a message through the driver, claiming that her family was allergic to seafood and that they couldn't stomach the local delicacies. Later, I learned from the servants that they simply thought the seafood my parents sent wasn't fresh enough, and the local products weren't high-end. To put it bluntly, they looked down on everything about my family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My folks are all bent out of shape just because I got hitched, and even more so because they look down on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, the Quinn family was nothing but polite to my parents, and everyone was engaged in pleasant conversation. Lily was moved by the scene. It also stirred up some unpleasant memories from my past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to lose my composure in front of everyone, so I made an excuse to go to the restroom, hoping to calm my inner turmoil.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I washed my hands in the restroom, touched up my makeup, and just as I was getting my composure back, I turned around only to see a face I had absolutely no desire to encounter.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="838.html">« Prev</a><a href="840.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
