Unexpectedly, as soon as I got in the car, I received a call from Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, please accompany me to the hospital. I feel a little uncomfortable in my stomach." Paige sounded weak. She was almost in the third trimester of pregnancy and was probably a little tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously glanced at the time and saw that it was still early, so I agreed, "Okay, where are you? I'll come and pick you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige soon sent her location to my mobile phone, so I immediately drove to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't seen her for a long time, and Paige looked fatter, with a round belly. She was wearing a long skirt and a pink down jacket, which made her look cute. Coupled with the cute white woolen hat on her head, she looked like a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I was there, she immediately walked over supporting her belly, opened the car door to get into the passenger seat, and immediately said excitedly, "Madeline, I heard Sylvia and Giselle fought last night. Well, it's so exciting. I guess we'll have some fun to watch when we go to the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that she was so well-informed and found out about it so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Fiona tell you this? Yes, the two of them beat each other up last night, and both of them were hurt," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I thought about the scene last night, I couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great. Bitches have to be beaten by bitches, and we good people can just watch the show! Drive quickly. We can go to the hospital to see what's going on!" Paige said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Paige heard this, she became excited and no longer looked weak. It made me suspect that she had been pretending to be sick just for gossiping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of us quickly arrived at the hospital where Fiona was located. After parking the car, I accompanied Paige to look for Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we gathered, it was natural for us to chat endlessly. While checking Paige, Fiona told us about last night's situation in an exaggerated way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona said when Laura rushed to the hospital last night, she thought the child was gone, so she was so anxious that she sat in the corridor and cried. Fortunately, Louis came out and told her that the child was saved, but Giselle had to be hospitalized for at least two weeks to prevent the baby from being born prematurely, and she also needed daily injections and IV drips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She deserves it! She was a mistress who drove the real wife away. She deserves to suffer!" Paige clapped her hands excitedly when she heard that Giselle had to stay at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Fiona covered her mouth, sneered, and then whispered, "Let me tell you, I saw her B-ultrasound results in the system again. Unsurprisingly, her baby is 99% likely to suffer from Down syndrome. Both non-invasive and amniotic fluid screenings show high risk. Even Louis advised her to have an abortion, but she refused. She is risking her life to get into a wealthy family. I don't know when this child is born, how will Juia react. It's exciting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is going to give birth to a child with Down syndrome? Is she crazy? This kind of child will be a great burden for both her and the Bryant family," Paige exclaimed when she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They had done so many evil things, so they deserve it. Don't tell anyone about it. Wait a few more months for the baby in her belly to be born. I don't know if the Bryant family will be shocked," Fiona said with a smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="551.html">« Prev</a><a href="553.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
