However, when he realized I was standing in front of Quinn, his eyes widened in surprise and he quickly pulled back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, he still managed to land a hit on my face. The pain was so intense that I couldn't help but crouch down, clutching my cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline! Are you alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men nearly cried out in surprise at the same time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had I crouched down than they both followed suit, their eyes on me, panic etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, Elliott, can you quit the drama? I just had dinner with Quinn, that's all. If I've committed a crime, call the cops, not make me watch you guys brawl, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's punch left my cheek throbbing with pain. I was seething with anger, unable to hold back a tirade against Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was rooted to the spot, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, a self-mocking smile playing on his lips. "Fooling around, huh? So, I shouldn't care, shouldn't ask?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're just grabbing a bite to eat," I explained, looking up at him with a sense of resignation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you keep it from me? And come on, there's no way it's just two people in that huge room, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott is sharp, I can't fool him at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was suddenly at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just an evening soiree I'm hosting, and I've asked Madeline to accompany me," Quinn explained on my behalf.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sneered, "Really? Quinn, you're throwing a party and you want Madeline to play hostess? Are there no other women in the world? Is that why you can't take your eyes off her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Quinn was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shot me a cold glance, then turned his gaze to Quinn. "You two owe me an explanation," he said. "Madeline, what exactly is going on between you and Quinn?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily lifted my gaze, meeting his questioning eyes. In that moment, I felt an overwhelming urge to spill the beans, to stop this charade. However, considering Elliott's condition, I chose once again to remain silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lost for words?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's hand rested on my shoulder, his repressed emotions threatening to break free. His eyes were a startling shade of red.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline! The child your mother was just holding, whose is it? Is it the one you gave birth to?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Laura's piercing voice echoed from outside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next thing I knew, Laura burst through the door in a flurry of panic, storming towards me with a fierce determination.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot a panicked glance at Quinn, who seemed equally taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid? What kid? Madeline, since when did you have a kid?" Elliott asked, baffled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Laura charging towards me, I quickly yanked her aside, leaning in to whisper a threat into her ear, "If you don't want Elliott's brain clot to burst, putting his life in danger, then shut your mouth! He's amnesic now, don't mention anything about a child in front of him!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="843.html">« Prev</a><a href="845.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
