Bonnie was so scared that she hurriedly stopped me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, what are you doing? You can only rest now, you can't go out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had something urgent to attend to, I had to go out for a while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Bonnie's obstruction, I opened the door to the ward and quickly walked out towards the hospital's main entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of lying in bed and speculating, I would rather go and see for myself what exactly happened, rather than enduring this constant guessing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admit I was a bit impulsive again, but I really find it difficult to be rational, and I simply cannot calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bonnie hurriedly caught up with me, she wanted to stop me, but I gave her a sharp look, and she immediately stepped aside without daring to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked briskly outside because it was late at night. Due to this reason, there were very few people in the hospital, and the nurses were probably just finishing their rounds, so there was no one on duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked directly to the elevator, sat in it, and went downstairs, ready to find Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised me was that, as soon as I walked out of the elevator, I saw Elliott holding Giselle and appearing at the entrance of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't see me, but hurried towards the emergency room with Giselle in his arms. Giselle was lying in his embrace, still wearing that sexy little tank top, and a pair of super short denim shorts on her lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, lying in Elliott's arms like this, looked so enchanting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My whole body's blood seemed to freeze in an instant, and I instinctively chased after him. And like that, I watched helplessly as my husband, holding another woman, screamed frantically in the emergency room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the doctor? Is there a doctor on duty? She is suffering from alcohol poisoning! Save her first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott appeared so anxious, so flustered, with sweat pouring down his forehead, even his usually meticulous hairstyle seemed a bit disheveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's slender body went limp in Elliott's arms, she looked so fragile and endearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm sure Elliott must have felt sorry, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned weakly against the doorway, watching as Elliott escorted her into the emergency room, watching as Elliott paced anxiously back and forth at the entrance of the emergency room. Then, Elliott suddenly caught sight of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We suddenly locked eyes like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I couldn't describe how much pain my heart was in, nor could I describe how shocked his eyes were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott probably never expected to see me standing in front of him like this, as his body visibly trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned on the spot, and it took him several seconds before he regained some clarity and walked towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, having witnessed all the truth with my own eyes, I simply didn't want to have a conversation with Elliott, nor did I want to hear him say anything again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned around and hurried towards the direction of the ward. I didn't want him to catch up, but I underestimated Elliott's stamina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Giselle for so long, and now he can still walk so fast. I had only taken a few steps, and he had already caught up with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott grabbed my arm and pulled me over, his eyes still trembling. He said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how did you get out of bed? How did you end up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lowered my head and smelled the scent of his cologne mixed with Giselle's, which made me particularly sensitive and crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I inexplicably felt that Elliott was dirty, indescribably dirty. I forcefully pushed Elliott away and didn't want to say another word, I walked forward on my own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, this time, I still hadn't taken a few steps when Elliott tightly grabbed me and pulled me into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott whispered, "Madeline, listen to me, everything is not as you think it is."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="174.html">« Prev</a><a href="176.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
