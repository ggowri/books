Nicole, you and Giselle should head back now," Elliott said, furrowing his brow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he wanted to prevent the situation from escalating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole glanced skeptically at Giselle, then at me. I could sense her lingering resentment towards me, but she didn't say anything. With a brief nod, Nicole took Giselle and left.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura, usually carefree, didn't notice the handprint on Giselle's face. Seeing them leave, she warmly took Lily's hand and suggested. "We rarely meet, how about having lunch together? Elliott will be there too, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for lunch now, let's plan for another time. It's getting late, Madeline, why don't you take me back," Lily politely declined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily clearly picked up on something from my words just now, and her expression showed some displeasure. However, out of politeness, she still restrained her emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll drop my mom off first, then come back to be with grandpa," I told Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That works, when your grandpa gets better, let's have a family meal together. Elliott, could you give Lily a ride?" Laura suggested.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Lily and I said in unison.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, with a neutral expression, didn't insist when we both declined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, take care on the way."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We said our goodbyes and left the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few steps out, Lily grabbed my hand and asked, "Madeline, what did you mean by that just now? Did something happen between that girl and Elliott?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily guessed right away, her concern evident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't worry about these things, I can handle it myself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, avoiding divulging too much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't keep everything to yourself. Tell me the truth. If there's something between Elliott and that girl, I won't let him off easily."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing, don't worry. Just focus on looking after dad for me, make sure he doesn't trust Jade and her father too much. These things are not important. What matters is our family's legacy. It must not fall into the wrong hands."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I redirected the conversation, not wanting Lily to fret over my affairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you've really changed. Remember, no matter what, our family will always be your strongest support. You can always talk to your parents about anything. We'll always stand by your side, okay?" Lily held my hand, emphasizing her words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touched, I felt a lump in my throat, thinking, "I was so foolish in my past life, causing misery for my parents."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I know, Mom."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We got into the car together, and I dropped her off at home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily, concerned that I had been pushed by Nicole, immediately checked for any injuries on my waist. Seeing a slight bruise, she became even more distressed, applying ointment to help alleviate the pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truly, no one cared for us more than our parents.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "In the previous life, I really committed a sin. For the sake of a bad man, I actually ignored my parents' feelings so much that it made their old age so bleak."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Lily's caring demeanor on my past mistakes, I vowed silently to protect my parents this time, ensuring they lived out their later years in peace and good health.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Lily applied the ointment, she asked me to rest on the couch for a while. Just as I was about to turn on the TV, Elliott unexpectedly called me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="238.html">« Prev</a><a href="240.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
