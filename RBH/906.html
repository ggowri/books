Then, Jasper asked Laura to leave the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something I can't hear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura Bryant's tone was full of dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I tell you to leave, you leave. I need to talk to Madeline alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's stern face left Laura no choice but to leave the room reluctantly, closing the door behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was married to</span><span> </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, Jasper often remained silent</span><span>. On many events, </span><span>even when present, </span><span>he acted like</span><span> a background figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the time, it was Laura who made a fuss, or when </span><span>Mr. Cormac Bryant </span><span>was around, he took control of the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I </span><span>seldom</span><span> faced Jasper alone and had no idea what he wanted to </span><span>talk</span><span> today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you feeling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of courtesy, I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My health has been deteriorating over the past two years, but Dr. Jones has given me a treatment plan to see if I can recover. Madeline, I wanted to talk to you about you and Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper Bryant spoke calmly, looking at me with a kind expression. It was the first time he addressed me so intimately as "Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott and I are </span><span>over</span><span>. What's there to talk about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I </span><span>remained</span><span> detached, but I could </span><span>see</span><span> his purpose for seeking me out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott has lost his memory and forgotten many things. He talked to me a lot last night. He said he wants to leave the past behind and start anew with you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you're willing, the Bryant family can formally propose again, and your family can set the dowry. Would you consider accepting Elliott again with this </span><span>offer</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper spoke slowly, and his words made </span><span>me surprised</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always seemed extremely proud to me, even though he never spoke much. Many of Laura's actions were supported by him behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must have thought I wasn't good enough for </span><span>Elliott</span><span> and that my family couldn't match the Bryant family's status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected him to lower himself so much now, offering to propose again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised, </span><span>I have to say, </span><span>but I didn't feel moved. The past wounds couldn't be erased with a simple proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I can't accept it, and neither can my parents.</span><span> What&rsquo;s done is done</span><span>. You should know better than anyone how your wife forced me out of the Bryant family and how </span><span>Mr. Cormac Bryant </span><span>pushed for our divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tone was cold and calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper sighed </span><span>deeply</span><span>:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know our family wronged you. My wife went too far back then. We were desperate because</span><span> </span><span>Cormac kept insisting on </span><span>wanting</span><span> a great-grand</span><span>son</span><span>, and you weren't getting pregnant. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had no choice but to take drastic measures, and we were deceived by Giselle Cole, which led to your marriage falling apart. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still feel </span><span>sorry for</span><span> it, especially seeing Elliott so lost after the divorce. My illness </span><span>is caused by my inner</span><span> </span><span>pain</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper Bryant </span><span>bent a little for apology, </span><span>coughed </span><span>a while </span><span>and continued:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bryant family has few descendants. My father had only </span><span>one son</span><span>, and I </span><span>only </span><span>have Elliott. </span><span>That&rsquo;s why </span><span>we place great importance on heirs. I hope you understand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was our fault back then. If you agree to be with Elliott again, our family is willing to provide a dowry and hold a grand wedding to bring you back with honor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also</span><span>, I can transfer 20% of my shares to you as compensation from my wife and me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my eyebrows in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A proposal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wedding?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>20% of the shares?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no small gesture. Jasper </span><span>was really giving an offer </span><span>with </span><span>great</span><span> sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryant Group's 20% shares would make me the second-largest shareholder. </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, who controls Bryant Group, doesn't even own half of its shares.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>20% of the shares is a </span><span>huge</span><span> fortune. With Bryant Group's current financial strength, the annual dividends alone would ensure </span><span>a</span><span> comfortabl</span><span>e</span><span> life</span><span> for me</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you worried that even if I remarry </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, things might not work out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Jasper, incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper Bryant smiled slightly and looked at me sincerely:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Elliott loses you again after remarrying, that's his problem. I know the </span><span>fault</span><span> wasn't with Elliott; it was us who made mistakes. Since we caused the problem, we should fix it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I only have one child, and I don't want him to be unhappy for life. Especially now, with the blood clot in his brain, I'm afraid if this continues, </span><span>if </span><span>any mishap </span><span>happened to him, </span><span>our wealth</span><span> would become</span><span> meaningless</span><span> without him</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper </span><span>has a clearer </span><span>logic than Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>had a better sense of perspective</span><span> than Laura Bryant does.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's a pity he didn't have such foresight back then. If he did, </span><span>Elliott</span><span> and I wouldn't be where we are today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But h</span><span>e's right. Back then, </span><span>Elliott</span><span> and I were so close. If they hadn't forced Giselle Cole to have a child, Elliott and I wouldn't have ended up divorced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if we hadn't divorced, they would already be enjoying a happy life with their grandchildren, instead of begging me to </span><span>go back to Elliott</span><span> now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything </span><span>has its reason</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only they knew </span><span>what mistake they were making</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're </span><span>offering</span><span> so much</span><span>. A</span><span>ren't you worried that I might be infertile and ruin the Bryant family's plans for an heir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, with a hint of sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper seemed to have anticipated my question. He replied calmly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of that, </span><span>it&rsquo;s only</span><span> my wife</span><span> to blame</span><span>. She was convinced you were infertile based on a single report. Otherwise, your child would have already been part of the Bryant family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you remarry, I do hope you and Elliott can have more children. But if... you really can't, we are willing to accept your current son and raise him as the Bryant family's third-generation heir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper Bryant's words shocked me. I raised my eyebrows:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That child isn't </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s biological son, and you don't mind?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="905.html">« Prev</a><a href="907.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
