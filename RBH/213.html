He had no time to wait for me and immediately strode toward the emergency room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ran and chased after him. From a long distance away, I saw many people at the door of the emergency room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura, Jasper, Barry, and other relatives were all there. Seeing Elliott, Laura immediately walked up to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you are finally back. Cormac is still in rescue. The doctor said his tailbone was broken, and there was some skin trauma on his head. Fortunately, he didn't hurt his brain."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long has he been in emergency? When will the operation be over?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott anxiously glanced at his watch and asked with a frown.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It should be over soon. The doctor said the operation was successful. Cormac will be out after a while of observation," Laura responded quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked up to them and was about to say something caring when a familiar voice came from behind Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Elliott. Cormac's condition is not severe."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected Giselle to be here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura heard Giselle's words and immediately took her arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said to Elliotte, "We should thank Giselle. If she hadn't gone to the countryside to visit Cormac and found him fallen in the orchard, Cormac would have been in a severe condition. Giselle is the savior of him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's words were full of gratitude, which stunned me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up and saw Giselle. She wore a simple white shirt and jeans, standing beside Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She heard what Laura said and spoke with a faint smile. "I went to visit Cormac but happened to find that he had fallen, so I called an ambulance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott knew what had happened and looked gratefully at Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, thank you very much for saving Cormac."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, after he are discharged from the hospital, we should thank Giselle in a formal way. Giselle and Cormac are like friends between generations, and she always goes to vist him these years. What a good girl," Laura smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she held Giselle's hand affectionately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched this scene quietly. Suddenly, I felt I was an outsider, and there seemed to be no chance for me to join the conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood beside Elliott, but everyone looked at Giselle. Even Laura and Jasper didn't notice that I came here with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only person who noticed me was probably Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I keenly felt that she glanced at me, and then I saw her smiling...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very proud now, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had saved Elliott last&nbsp;time, and this time, she saved Cormac. Moreover, her father lost his life to save Jasper. It was normal that Laura and Elliott liked her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt very lost.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing here, I suddenly felt the sweetness that had existed between Elliott and me in Louis City in the past two days seemed to be just a dream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this feeling of being alienated was the most real...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="212.html">« Prev</a><a href="214.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
