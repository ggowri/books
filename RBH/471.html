I live alone anyway. Come over. I've just brewed some coffee waiting for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus promptly agreed over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after hanging up, I immediately drove to Marcus' place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing I came, he stood at the door waiting for me. Upon seeing me, he ushered me into his home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having just been in close contact with Elliott, I had worn a medical mask as a precaution before stepping out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had entered Marcus</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>home, which was my first visit since he moved</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Different from the decor in my home, Marcus' place had a more classical feel, adorned with his cherished paintings and filled with a faint scent throughout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just made a pot of coffee, a rare find from my friend. Give it a try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus invited me into the study room, and I saw an entire wall of books.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, your home is so classical, filled with books everywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admired, taking a look around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have many other hobbies. I enjoy reading in my spare time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and poured a cup of coffee, offering it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, did your last attempt to collaborate with Bryant Group on developing that drug succeed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus paused for a moment, then shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They replied saying that the project is still under discussion and evaluation, so I plan to look for other partners after the holidays."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, I felt a surge of joy and immediately spoke up, "If that's the case, let's collaborate. If possible, I'd like to sign the agreement as soon as possible and start production early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious?" Marcus seemed surprised. He looked at me with uncertainty. "Madeline, the cost of producing this drug is not low, and there are indeed many similar drugs on the market, which is why Bryant Group hesitated for so long. Are you sure you want to collaborate with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! I came to you specifically to discuss this. Not only do I want to collaborate, but I also hope this drug can be produced in large quantities! As for funding, I can take full responsibility, so you don't have to worry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said firmly, without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus became even more astonished. He looked at me incredulously and stood up excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, do you really trust me? What if the drug doesn't sell well after it's launched? The investment involved is not a small sum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand. Since I've chosen to collaborate with you, I'm prepared to bear the corresponding risks! I'm ready for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said solemnly. My resolute attitude immediately earned Marcus' admiration. He sincerely gave me a thumbs up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I didn't expect that after all these years, you're still the same as you were back in school. Decisive and straightforward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words brought back memories of my student days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, before falling in love with Elliott, I was carefree and spirited. There was never anyone or anything worth my attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that dazzling version of me slowly turned from a shining diamond into cheap glass because of that love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They say once a woman had given up on love, she had started to grow rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Marcus' full appreciation, I became acutely aware that I could have been an outstanding and irreplaceable woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're willing, I'd like to sign the agreement with you as soon as possible! The sooner, the better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Marcus, once again expressing my determination without hesitation.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="470.html">« Prev</a><a href="472.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
