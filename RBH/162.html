My mom made soup for you, she said it's good for your health, I poured some out for you to try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle immediately stepped forward and placed the lunch box on the table. After opening the lunch box, a strong aroma instantly wafted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, Elliott's phone rang. Not knowing what the person on the other end of the line said, his expression became solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately said, "Okay, I will go back to the company right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did the company have an urgent matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, there was a slight emergency at the company, I will come over as soon as I handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott nodded, he didn't say specifically what it was, but through the seriousness on his face, I knew that this matter must have been somewhat tricky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you go ahead. Don't worry, I'll take care of Madeline here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle quickly smiled and said to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glanced at the watch on his wrist, then nodded and patted Giselle's shoulder, saying, "Alright, I'll leave it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Elliott quickly walked out of the ward, the room immediately fell into a moment of silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being reborn, this is still the first time I have been alone with Giselle in a relatively closed environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the increasing frequency of contact between Elliott and Giselle, based on their recent conversation, I didn't feel any special connection between them, and I don't know why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but take a glance at Giselle and noticed that she seemed to have lost some weight and her complexion had become a bit darker compared to last time. It seems that she has indeed suffered a bit during these days at the exhibition venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes had bloodshot veins, indicating that she probably didn't get enough rest last night. Such an incident must have been quite stressful for her, being a young girl who had just graduated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pondered silently in my heart, and at that moment, she had already poured a bowl of soup and placed it in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Madeline, let me feed you some soup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This bowl of soup looks really delicious, but thinking about what happened in the past, I dare not try the things they gave me now, especially food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have much appetite now, you go ahead and put it aside, I'll drink later. By the way, I heard Elliott say that there is still construction going on at the site today, don't you need to be there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had a day off today," Giselle's voice suddenly became hesitant, and she even looked like she wanted to cry as she said, "Something happened last night, and Elliott immediately held several departments accountable for it. Ms. Swift was also scolded. Ms. Swift told me that I don't have to be involved in the upcoming process anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Giselle not only failed to take credit this time, but also received punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really thought that the bloodshot eyes in her eyes were due to her feeling guilty for causing me harm, but now it seems that it should be because she has suffered great grievances at work!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed my fault in this matter. I had foreseen the plot in advance and stole her script.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I did not feel the slightest bit of guilt. On the contrary, I felt very satisfied. After all, compared to the pain I had experienced in my previous life, what did her small grievances amount to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not your fault either. When Elliott comes back, I will explain it to him again, so you don't have to worry about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised me was that Giselle suddenly lifted her head and looked at me, with a hint of defiance in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly said, "Actually, Madeline, I had already discovered those pearls long ago and reminded Jimmy more than once, but Jimmy simply didn't care. If it weren't for you being Mrs. Bryant, they wouldn't have immediately moved those pearls last night, and they are still complaining now, saying that if it weren't for you insisting they move, it wouldn't have mattered, as the rain has stopped today and it hasn't had much impact..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood the implied meaning behind her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that she wanted to tell me that she had actually noticed this issue a long time ago, but it was only because of my status that she was able to successfully put pressure on Jimmy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned out to be just as impure as I thought, a pure girl would never deliberately say these words to me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="161.html">« Prev</a><a href="163.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
