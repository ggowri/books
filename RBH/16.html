Not bad. Although it's small, it looks very elegant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan, you came so quickly. I just told my mom that you were the first kind person I met after joining the Bryant Group. You helped me a lot, and my mom said she wanted to thank you properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle went up, and her arrogant tone became very enthusiastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she appeared weak, this young girl was actually very good at socializing. Just a moment ago, she clearly didn't say a word to her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly felt that I had learned something new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their subsequent conversation, I became even more certain that Evan was a relatively senior employee in the Bryant Group's Purchasing Department, and he clearly had some interest in Giselle. During the conversation, he often intentionally or unintentionally touched Giselle's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Giselle, this girl appeared to be very innocent, but it seemed as if she had already experienced the hardships of society. Not only did she handle Evan with ease, but she also cooperated well with her mother. They quickly pleased Evan, and he immediately agreed to include them as a preferred supplier and submit an application to the higher-ups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood quietly in this flower shop for over half an hour like this. Fortunately, I rarely went to the Bryant Group, and I had never appeared in public with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Evan didn't know me and had no idea that I was Elliott's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they saw off Evan, I randomly picked a bouquet of flowers in the store, paid for it, and walked out of the flower shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on what happened next in my previous life, it was evident that the purchase application submitted by Evan was approved. Therefore, it was only then that Giselle was given the opportunity to meet Elliott every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this lifetime, I would not let such a good thing happen to Giselle again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After walking out of the flower shop, I immediately called Milo Gibson, the head of the Purchasing Department at the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lower-level employees of the Bryant Group did not know me, but the executives of the Bryant Group had seen me at my wedding with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I revealed my identity, Milo's tone on the phone became extremely respectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, I didn't expect you to call me. Please tell me what I can do for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gibson, is it true that the Bryant Group has been looking for a fresh flower supplier recently?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked with a smile on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes. How do you know about such a small matter?" Milo was taken aback when I asked about it, and he quickly inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I have a friend who has set up a flower plantation on the outskirts of the city. The flowers there are fresh and affordable. Nowadays, cost control is being advocated, and the Bryant Group is no exception. I will send you my friend's contact information so that you can compare the prices later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished speaking, I immediately sent Milo Paige's phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's family was in the business of gardening. However, Paige did not participate in the family business. Instead, he engaged in flower cultivation on the outskirts of the city. I heard that he was planning to build a motel in the flower base recently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how good her flowers were, they must be cheaper than those in Nicole's flower shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, I took the initiative to introduce a supplier to Milo. As long as he was not foolish, he would naturally understand my intentions. He would never choose to cooperate with a small store owner like Nicole again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This trip was not in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I set up another obstacle on the love path of Giselle and Elliott... I really didn't know what would happen to this pair of miserable lovers before they got together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had a faint mischievous anticipation...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="15.html">« Prev</a><a href="17.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
