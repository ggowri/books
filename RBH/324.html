"Quinn, how come you seem to know everything?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A knowing smile was at Quinn's mouth. "Jade schemed against your dad, and then against your mom and you. Now she's been arrested by the police, and surely awaits a long life behind bars. Isn't this about revenge?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh... So that was what he meant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he knew about what I experienced in my past life. That startled me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, with the evidence I have in hand, she won't be able to escape this time. Luckily I found out early, otherwise, if my dad really handed over Glory Group to her, the consequences would have been unimaginable." I nodded, feeling a pang of emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, everything is under control. Actually, her schemes weren't that cunning, it's just that you and your dad were too trusting. You know, people can be unpredictable. You better not trust anyone easily in the future, got it?" Quinn patted me on the head like an older brother, indulgently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tilted my head, looking at him with a half-smile, half-teasing look. "When you say don't trust anyone, does that include you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn knew I was teasing. So, he mischievously ruffled my hair, messing up my hairstyle. Then, he ran off laughing, saying, "Yes, you better not trust me. I'm the worst guy in the world. Who knows what I'll do next!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, stop messing up my hair! You're going too far!" I never expected him to play a prank like this, ruining my perfectly styled hair. So, I chased after him in annoyance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this little play, the heavy mood that was pressing on my heart seemed to lift a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the many worries still lingering, at least Jade, the big troublemaker, has been ousted from Glory Group. Our family's legacy is secure. There won't be a tragic ending like the one in my past life, where everything was lost.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I ran along the busy road, playing and chasing each other until I was breathless and couldn't run anymore. He finally stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn sometimes acted like a grown-up child, always mischievous. Seeing me red-faced and out of breath, he pointed to a nearby bar and said, "Look at you, all tired out. Let's go to that music bar over there. Celebrate your successful revenge today!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I followed his gaze. Sure enough, there was a music bar not far away, still open for business. From the outside, it looked trendy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After running so much and with the cold weather, I was indeed parched. I needed a drink to quench my thirst.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, didn't you ask me to treat you to ten meals last time? This time, it's my treat." I shook my head, then walked with Quinn towards the bar.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="323.html">« Prev</a><a href="325.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
