Based on his performance at that time, I felt that he had the potential to be nurtured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I called him to my office, and we discussed a lot while watching this drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam had just graduated from drama school not long ago and was still new at Glory Group. He was handsome, and his smile was particularly bright, especially his teeth, which added a lot to his personal image.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was actually quite easy-going in character. As we chatted, he also visibly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, if you really want to do this project, I suggest we collaborate with the copyright holder as soon as possible. As far as I know, the Bryant Group also has an interest in this play and has been in negotiations recently. I'm afraid they'd take away the copyright if we act late, then we will completely lose the opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did remind me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, the drama was taken by the Bryant Group at around this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we have decided to do it, we must settle it down. Here's the plan. You immediately contact them and tonight we invite them for dinner to discuss the details of the cooperation thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately said to Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Adam immediately walked out and called the copyright holder. In less than a moment, he returned with a melancholic expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, we were a step behind. The Bryant Group had already arranged a dinner with the copyright holder in the evening. And it is said that the president of the Bryant Group himself will personally attend the appointment. I'm afraid we're out for this play..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was the president of the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has always been enthusiastic about big projects. Why would he suddenly attach so much importance to a small television drama, and even personally come to negotiate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My gaze slightly changed, and I stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, find out where they're having the dinner, and we will go there now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam obviously didn't know about my relationship with Elliott. He was quite surprised, but he still went to handle it immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, we found out where they had dinner for the night. It was a private restaurant in Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant was said to be very elegant and expensive. The only drawback was that it was located in a forest on the outskirts of the city, which was somewhat remote. To get there, one had to drive a short distance on a winding mountain road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that it was almost mealtime, I didn't hesitate and immediately drove there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was in Private Room No. 888. When I arrived there, I saw his secretary Barry ordering food in the lobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was clearly taken aback when he saw me, but out of politeness, he immediately greeted me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, you... how did you come here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that Mr. Bryant was having dinner here. In which private room is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, Mr. Bryant was not here. Where did you know it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry hesitated a bit, after all, in the past, I had also appeared in Elliott's presence with such a fierce momentum, demanding Elliott from Barry. When he saw me, he was already a bit nervous reflexively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter then approached Barry and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, may I ask if the dishes for Private Room No. 6 are ready to be served now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Private Room No. 6... I got it, thanks, Barry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Barry to answer, I already knew the answer. I smiled and patted his shoulder, then immediately walked towards Private Room No. 6.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, please wait. Mr. Bryant has something to discuss tonight. It's inconvenient for you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry had already realized what was happening at that moment. He immediately caught up and shouted loudly. However, at that time, I had already briskly walked to the door of Private Room No. 6.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could stop me, I pushed the door open and walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, I tried my best to stop her, but Mrs. Bryant still insisted on barging in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry hurriedly followed behind me, probably afraid of Elliott's reprimand, as he desperately tried to excuse himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was dressed in a navy blue suit, sitting upright in the center of the private room. His expression was serious, and his deep eyes looked sharply at me. He exuded an air of nobility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was even more eye-catching than him was Sylvia who was sitting next to him, wearing a hollowed-out evening gown and curly hair.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="21.html">« Prev</a><a href="23.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
