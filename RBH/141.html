I look much more handsome in person than in the photos. You will be able to see me in a while," Adam nodded and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was the kind of boy who was very talkative. Chatting with him, there was no need to worry about awkward silences. I casually asked him, and he immediately shared some interesting stories about the male protagonist with me. He also told me the names and characteristics of several supporting roles in our play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We chatted all the way and finally arrived at the film and television base in Louis City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louis City is a city adjacent to Hoswich, just over an hour's drive away from Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After we arrived, we checked into the hotel that the film crew had contracted. The next morning, we went to the set for the first day of filming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The director team specifically chose a good time, early in the morning. I took out a classical long dress from my suitcase and started getting dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This classical long dress of mine was custom-made for me by an old tailor known to Lily. The dress is light yellow in color, with green lotus leaves and lotus flower embroidery on it. The craftsmanship is excellent, with delicate gold edges on the collar, cuffs, and hem. To have a good symbolic meaning, I specifically asked the tailor to incorporate a lace design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The classical long dress was very picky about body shape, but fortunately, my figure was already outstanding. Wearing this exquisite classical long dress, paired with a gemstone bracelet and a pair of delicate pearl earrings, instantly created a thousand different styles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood in front of the mirror, looking at myself in the mirror. Even I myself didn't expect that, I could be so beautiful when I put on a classical long dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, because I couldn't figure out what type of clothing Elliott liked, I never tried wearing classical long dresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I used to worry all the time, always speculating about his preferences, and constantly afraid that he would think these clothes were too vintage or traditional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, I no longer have to consider other people's preferences. I can do whatever makes me happy. In fact, I have realized more and more that as long as I find the right style of clothing, I can effortlessly achieve a new level of beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at myself in the mirror and the more I looked, the more pleasing I found myself. So, I put on another beautiful makeup and tied my hair into a simple bun. Then, I pushed open the door and walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was already waiting for me in the downstairs lobby. The moment I appeared from the elevator, Adam's eyes clearly sparkled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately came forward. "My goodness, Madeline, your outfit, it's like a classical beauty straight out of the Baroque era! So beautiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was really generous with his praise, he immediately gave a thumbs up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, today is the day of the premiere, and I started off on a high note. I specially chose this classical long dress! It's getting late, let's go to the set early!" I grew even more confident, swaying my sexy little hips, walking with a confident stride, and arrived at the set with Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The set had already been set up, and everything needed for the opening ceremony had also been prepared. The director's team and the crew members were all on standby, and the actors participating in this play had all arrived at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this drama, we boldly employed newcomers this time. Except for the male lead, who is a rising newcomer in the industry, almost all the supporting roles are relatively unknown newcomers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Frank saw me coming, he immediately welcomed me to the center stage. Several leading actors stood by, ready for action. When the time came, we immediately held a grand opening ceremony, and the whole scene appeared particularly lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time I stepped into the film and television industry, I didn't intervene too much in everything on set. However, because I was the biggest investor in this drama, as soon as the opening ceremony ended, several young male actors who were involved in this drama immediately surrounded me. Adam, seeing the situation, also stayed by my side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Madeline? Can I add you on WhatsApp?" said an actor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I was the male supporting actor in this play, and I also wanted to add you on WhatsApp," said another male actor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="140.html">« Prev</a><a href="142.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
