At this moment, I felt even more relaxed.</p><p>Elliott probably never expected that I would be so bold. His fury was suddenly ignited.</p><p>He grabbed my collar and shouted, &quot;Madeline, how dare you!&quot;</p><p>I touched his hand with a faint smile, but he bounced it away as if he had touched something unclean.</p><p>Pretending to be indifferent, I straightened my collar, stood up straight, and looked at Elliott.</p><p>I said loudly, &quot;Elliott, we live our own lives from now on. Let&#x27;s get along in peace and not interfere with each other.&quot;</p><p>I said that not only to Elliott but also to his friends who used to look down on me.</p><p>I wasn&#x27;t good enough to make Elliott fall in love with me. But from now on, I will never allow him to damage my dignity and bottom line on any occasion.</p><p>Then, I was about to leave.</p><p>To be honest, the box smelt terrible, and the perfume scent filled the air. I couldn&#x27;t wait to leave.</p><p>&quot;Elliott, she is so arrogant. Why don&#x27;t you divorce her?&quot; Sylvia said.</p><p>I didn&#x27;t mess with Sylvia, but Sylvia instigated Elliott to divorce me in front of me.</p><p>I sneered and stopped. Before Elliott could say anything, I turned around and slapped Sylvia in her face.</p><p>&quot;You bitch! Seemed your job requires you to be sociable and come to various parties. But you seduced my husband? Ugh! If you ask him to divorce me again, I&#x27;ll make your life in a hell!&quot; I snapped at Sylvia.</p><p>She didn&#x27;t expect that I, who had always been a coward in the past, could be so bold now.</p><p>Sylvia covered her swollen face and was so angry that her face turned blue and white. She hesitated for a long time without saying a complete sentence. In the end, she cried and tugged at Elliott&#x27;s clothes.</p><p>She said, &quot;Elliott, she... she doesn&#x27;t take you seriously at all!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Go away,&quot; Elliott said.</p><p>Elliott kept fixing his eyes on me. At this time, a meaningful look replaced his anger.</p><p>I thought he was talking about me, so I smiled and said, &quot;Okay.&quot;</p><p>In the past, I would be very painful when he yelled at me. But now, I had given up on him. I felt nothing but numb.</p><p>Just as I was about to turn around, he shook off his sleeves vigorously, pointed to the door, and said to Sylvia, &quot;I hate women who cry. Get out.&quot;</p><p>Sylvia was a star. Being driven away by him in public, she felt humiliated. In an instant, she cried and ran out of the box.</p><p>For just a few minutes, the voices of the three of us echoed in the box.</p><p>The others were stunned and were speechless. Everyone looked at us not daring to breathe.</p><p>I glanced at Elliott subconsciously, surprised that he drove Sylvia away.</p><p>Back then, relying on his favor, Sylvia pissed me off many times. I didn&#x27;t expect that he would let her go so easily tonight.</p><p>&quot;Madeline, we hardly hang out. Fancy a game of pool? I heard you pool like a pro.&quot;</p><p>Quinn asked me to play pool with them.</p><p>Did I hear it wrong?</p><p>I almost couldn&#x27;t believe my ears. But Quinn had walked up to me.</p><p>Only then did I notice that the box was not only for singing. There was a billiard room, a game room, a massage room... It was fully equipped.</p><p>&quot;No, thanks. Today is my friend&#x27;s birthday, and I want to be with her.&quot;</p><p>I didn&#x27;t know what Quinn was up to. Besides, I didn&#x27;t want to stay with them. So, I refused immediately.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Paige came forward and said happily, &quot;It&#x27;s okay. I haven&#x27;t played pool for a long time. We can ask our friend over and have fun together!&quot;</p><p>It was no surprise. Paige was enthusiastic about handsome men and never missed a chance to get to know them.</p><p>Elliott&#x27;s friends were rich and good-looking. In addition to Quinn and him, Sawyer Pierce, Alexis Knight, and Philip Arnold were also popular in the circle.</p><p>However, in the past, his friends despised me and didn&#x27;t want to be friends with me at all. So I had no chance to introduce them to Paige.</p><p>Paige was excited. Before I said yes, she immediately went to our box and asked our friends over.</p><p>As the host, Quinn immediately asked the waiter to bring champagne, fruit, and various snacks and invited my friends to sit down.</p><p>Then, he motioned for me to go to the billiards room for a competition.</p><p>I was hesitating when Fiona whispered in my ear, &quot;Come on. Take the chance to flirt with his friends and piss him off.&quot;</p><p>Fiona was very observant. She felt the strange atmosphere in the box the moment she entered.</p><p>She made the point. I thought, <em>&quot;That&#x27;s right. Instead of looking for men, I might as well use the opportunity to get back at Elliott.&quot;</em></p><p>I smiled and went to the billiards room with Quinn. Before leaving, I took a glance at Elliott and found that his face was sullen.</p><p>I smirked secretly.</p><p>In the billiards room, Quinn gave me the pool cue. I took it and stood in the center of the pool table. I pointed the pool cue at the cue ball and started quickly.</p><p>Although I hadn&#x27;t played pool for a long time, with my foundation and talent, I got a hole in three.</p><p>Quinn applauded me. Paige and Fiona cheered for me.</p><p>&quot;Madeline, you&#x27;re awesome!&quot;</p><p>Actually, I had a lot of activities before I got married. However, I gave up my hobbies after marrying Elliott, and he never took me out. So, he and his friends never knew I was capable of this.</p><p>Their looks told me how surprised they were.</p><p>Quinn couldn&#x27;t help but applaud me again. He praised, &quot;You&#x27;re awesome!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mr. Woods, this is no big deal. I can do much more than this.&quot;</p><p>I smiled, rubbed some powder on the cue, blew twice calmly, and waited for Quinn&#x27;s performance.</p><p>As the owner of this club, Quinn also had good skills. Although I set up obstacles, he still cleverly avoided them and hit the pocket.</p><p>After a few rounds, only the eight ball was left on the table. The winner would be decided. I was enthusiastic about the competition and couldn&#x27;t help but speed up my breathing.</p><p>Quinn looked serious. He leaned over and stared sharply at the ball before him. He adjusted his posture several times and finally broke after spotting the correct position. However, the ball was far away from the hole. Although he had made an accurate judgment, the ball still deviated from the pocket and landed on the left side.</p><p>It was my turn.</p><p>Paige looked at the positions of the cue ball and eight ball, shook her head, and said, &quot;It&#x27;s tricky. Madeline, come on!&quot;</p><p>Fiona said, &quot;Madeline is great. She can make it!&quot;</p><p>Elliott&#x27;s friends were also discussing. Everyone focused their attention on the game.</p><p>I took a deep breath and ignored all the chatter. According to my experience, I knew it was hard to hit the ball into the pocket next to it, but there was another way...</p><p>After I calculated the angles, I immediately sat on the edge of the table and pointed the cue at a vertical angle at the cue ball. Looking at the other pocket, I pushed the cue hard. The cue ball turned rapidly, and the eight ball quickly hit the other hole. As I predicted, the eight ball bounced back quickly after hitting the edge of the opposite table and rolled towards the middle pocket in a 45-degree direction. Finally, it fell steadily into the middle pocket.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, everyone exclaimed and applauded.</p><p>I looked at the empty table. At that moment, I smiled with relief.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Woods, sorry. I win.&quot;</p><p>I blinked at Quinn.</p><p>However, I never thought that Elliott would be standing where Quinn was.</p><p>My eyes met Elliott&#x27;s instantly. With his hands in his pockets, he stood straight among the crowd. </p><p>&quot;Had enough?&quot;</p><p>Elliott spoke in a bad tone, seeming to have held back his anger for a long time.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="6.html">« Prev</a><a href="8.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
