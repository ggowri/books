In the past, they only told Elliott to go back. After all, in their eyes, I was not worthy of Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Was the reception successful this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and asked him about the result of the reception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Their cooperation has basically been confirmed. I have arranged for someone to accompany them for a few days of sightseeing in the country. Once they return to Dikio, the cooperation can be finalized," Elliott said solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great. Did I help you this time?" I said with a cheerful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and Elliott also smiled slightly. He nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did well this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He affirmed me once again. It seems that he is slowly accepting me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's good. He realized my strengths before he fell in love with Giselle. This way, he didn't constantly compare Giselle and me, thinking that I was worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were chatting and soon arrived at Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already late. Let's go upstairs together. I want to sleep in the guest bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott said, "Sleep in the master bedroom tonight. Do you want to be questioned by my parents tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Elliott's reminder, I recalled that his parents had arranged a "spy" at Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I slept in separate rooms with Elliott for a long time, they would know. If that were the case, it would be difficult for me to explain to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, we could sleep in the same room. We'll use different blankets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I made a decision immediately. As soon as I returned to the master bedroom, I immediately took a new blanket from the wardrobe and placed it on the other side of the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned at me. He seemed very helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had gradually gotten used to me keeping my distance from him. He didn't say anything and went to the bathroom to take a shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked around the master bedroom. In the past, most of the things placed in this room were mine. Elliott rarely slept here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, things are different. He slept here more and more often, and his personal belongings in the room gradually increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On my dressing table, there were his skincare products. The wardrobe was filled with his everyday clothes, and his favorite books were placed on the bedside table. His toiletries were on the washbasin. His presence even permeated the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We seemed to have been two droplets of water that never intersected before, but now we are slowly merging together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, I would definitely have felt very happy. Such a life used to be something I could only dream of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know why I don't feel happy now. On the contrary, I occasionally remind myself to be rational and not be deceived by everything in front of me. Elliott ultimately belongs to another woman, and everything now is not real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott took a shower, I went to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thoughtfully squeezed toothpaste for me and filled the bathtub with just the right amount of water, at the perfect temperature. His thoughtfulness made me feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After brushing my teeth, I lay in the bathtub and soaked for a while, while brushing my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I suddenly received a message from Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Madeline and Elliott arrive home safely?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle asked me if Elliott had arrived home safely. Are they together at night?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="109.html">« Prev</a><a href="111.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
