What we want is the buzz. Try to arrange more gigs and events for Audrey lately. Sign her up for any TV awards she can attend. This girl has potential, and we need to capitalize on this wave of popularity to elevate her! Moving forward, we'll use this show as a stepping stone to prepare for our foray into the film and television industry," I told Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I've arranged everything I can for her lately. But, the Bryant Group's PR is now trying to divert public attention by attacking Audrey, attempting to release some dirt on her to shift focus. Luckily, Audrey has a clean record and not much dirt to dig up. They only found out she had a bit of cosmetic work done. Nowadays, who hasn't had a little nip and tuck? Besides, she just got her eyes done!" Adam complained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled, "The more they belittle, the more we rise above. Have Audrey admit to her eye surgery openly. Maybe being upfront about it could actually win her some favor. It's better than Jezebel, who's faced with heaps of evidence and still vehemently denies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'll inform her team to do just that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following my lead, Adam was really getting into it now. He would do everything I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, hold on. Can you also help me arrange a meeting with Mr. Hall from Netflix? Tell him I'd like to invite him to dinner," I told Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how much effort Bryant Group's PR put into burying Jezebel's dirt, I couldn't let them easily change the tide in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hall? Madeline, are you sure? He's known to be opportunistic. I heard he's not picky and ready to take advantage of any woman." Adam voiced his concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. I have my reasons. Just set up the meeting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought of the photos on my phone and couldn't help but smile. With those photos in hand, I wasn't worried about Rickson at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next evening, around six o'clock, I was dressed in a black strapless dress, draped with a black wool coat, wearing meticulous makeup, and letting my hair cascade down. I headed straight to Jade Restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For this meeting with Rickson, I had decided to go alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when Rickson opened the door to the private room and saw only me sitting there, he seemed surprised. Then, a meaningful smile crept onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had only recently entered the workforce this year and rarely made public appearances. Most of the negotiations with Netflix had been handled by Adam and Isaac before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Rickson wasn't familiar with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Adam had described, despite being not particularly tall and a bit chubby, Rickson's face would naturally light up when he saw a woman. His gaze had been glued to me since he first saw me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I purposely chose a larger private room. Despite many empty seats at the round table, Rickson walked straight toward me and deliberately took the seat next to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he sat down, he couldn't help but look me up and down incessantly. Then, he reached out his hand cordially and said with a beaming smile, "You must be Ms. Mayers, the assistant to the Chairman of Glory Group, right? It's my pleasure to meet you. I didn't expect you to be so young and beautiful."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="426.html">« Prev</a><a href="428.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
