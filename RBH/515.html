He was probably worried that I would be sad, he reached out and patted my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't dwell on it. Since you're already divorced, just move on. Elliott is dead serious in business. He wouldn't let anyone gain the upper hand. I know that much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and couldn't help but quip. "Yeah, I get it. So, it's crystal clear now how hollow Elliott's words of love were before. To him, love probably pales in comparison to profit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men are rational beings. They don't mix things up, especially someone like Elliott. Let's drop it. Get some more sleep. It's still early, not even dawn yet." Quinn was concerned that I might be too tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you should get some more sleep too." I nodded, and we both lay down. However, perhaps because my mind was now completely awake, despite lying down, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Quinn suddenly spoke, revealing he wasn't asleep either, "Are you still awake, Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I can't sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about I'll tell you a story," Quinn offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know why the fifth floor is so quiet?" Quinn asked mysteriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" I asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because it used to be dedicated to intern students learning anatomy. Later, this floor was haunted..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's voice grew even more mysterious, and his words sent shivers down my spine. Suddenly, I felt inexplicably afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, stop it! Stop talking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's true. So when Mr. Muller suggested I stay here, he was actually asking for my opinion on whether I had any concerns. I've never been afraid of anything. I told him I'm an atheist, and I couldn't care less about these things. But, did you just hear something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn knew I was scared, yet he continued with his story. I wasn't sensitive to sounds before, but after he said that I suddenly heard water dripping from somewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you talking about that sound of water? Quinn, please, I'm begging you. Please stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shuddered all over, sat up abruptly from the bed, and immediately turned on the light out of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this eerie hospital, whether by coincidence or otherwise, as soon as the light came on, it flickered a few times before finally going out completely, making the atmosphere even more spooky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're scared, you can come to sleep beside me," Quinn said in a low voice in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for that. I'm fine," I hastily insisted, trying to appear brave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Quinn and I were just friends. It wouldn't be appropriate to lie together like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that a few years ago, every night on this floor, there would be the sound of a girl crying. Once, when a security guard was patrolling, he even saw a white figure right outside the laundry room we just visited. The guard asked why she was doing laundry in the middle of the night, and when the girl turned around, she had no facial features at all. The guard was so frightened that he passed out. Since that day, the sound of dripping water would echo through this building every late night..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For whatever reason, Quinn kept on talking, even though I didn't want to hear it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more I listened, the more terrified I became. And just then, the dripping sound grew louder and louder while I was surrounded by darkness. I couldn't help but let out a scream, completely forgetting everything else, and just lunged towards Quinn's bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pulled back a corner of the blanket and dove straight into the covers without a word.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="514.html">« Prev</a><a href="516.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
