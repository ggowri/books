However, she clearly seemed to be enjoying herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I could also understand. After all, Giselle had worked so hard for so long and finally succeeded in standing by Elliott's side, about to become his wife. How could she not be excited? I'm afraid even in her dreams last night, she could wake up with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I secretly sneered in my heart. A sinister smile appeared on my face, as I watched them with amusement, while eating without any courtesy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I secretly exclaimed, "No wonder it's the highest standard. All the dishes on this table are made from top-quality ingredients, and all the wines are limited edition... The amount of money the Bryant family spent this time has shocked even me, who used to belong to the Bryant family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle gave birth to a boy for the Bryant family and received such treatment in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I touched my swollen belly and couldn't help but mourn silently for the child growing quietly inside me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Giselle hadn't secretly done so many bad things, if the seniors of the Bryant family hadn't been heartless and cruel, this grand feast should have belonged to the baby inside my belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I could only sit here, watching helplessly as Giselle took away everything </span><span>from me, watching as they enjoyed themselves, watching as they triumphed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the happier they were at the moment, the more miserable they would be later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, I felt like a hunter crawling in the grass, secretly adjusting the barrel of my gun, waiting for the prey to reach the climax of their celebration, and giving them a heavy blow with great pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat at the banquet table, quietly observing as they smoothly completed the engagement process. I also calmly watched Elliott and Giselle holding the same bottle of champagne, happily pouring it down from the top of the champagne tower. I saw Giselle smiling brightly like a flower, and I also saw Laura fluttering between the various tables like a butterfly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the continuous inquiries from the crowd, it finally came to the moment when the baby made an appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything turned out just as I had expected. Perhaps it was because the baby looked extremely ugly, making it inconvenient to bring him out to meet people for the time being. Therefore, the Bryant family, this time, did not bring the child to the scene, citing the reason that the baby was still young and susceptible to viral infections. Instead, they opted for photos and videos, allowing everyone to catch a glimpse of the Bryant family's "grandchild" on the big screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the countdown of the host, the photo of the child finally appeared on the big screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, I waited for this moment, and I felt my blood boiling all over my body, as if my chest was on fire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, on the large screen, the initially played photos were the ones carefully arranged by the Bryant family. However, the screen suddenly flickered, and the real photo of the child and the video of them lying in the hospital incubator played without any warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, accompanying the video, there were also the voices of nurses chatting while providing care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This child is not only a premature baby, but also a child with Down syndrome. Look at the distance between his eyes and his mouth, I really don't know how his parents could accept it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shh, don't talk nonsense. Doctor Louis ordered us not to discuss the child's appearance, and furthermore, strictly forbade us from sharing the child's photos and videos with anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know. Didn't I secretly chat with you because there was no one around? I heard that this child is the son of the president of the Bryant Group. I don't understand, they are so wealthy, how could they allow the mother to give birth to a child with Down syndrome? It's clearly something that can be screened during a woman's pregnancy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows? I heard that this child's mother was a mistress, perhaps she resorted to some unethical means."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, even though he's a son, what could he do when he has Down syndrome? Moreover, this child was born prematurely and has a lot of issues. I hate to say so, but how long he can live is still unknown. I can only say that nowadays, women really go </span><span>all out to marry into wealthy families."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="638.html">« Prev</a><a href="640.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
