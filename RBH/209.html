I simply snuggled up to his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why I had such a shy reaction, and my behavior undoubtedly teased Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finally took a shower to calm down, and now he couldn't help but hold my face and kiss me affectionately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mouth was blocked, and I couldn't say anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a master of kissing, taking me into a place I had never reached before with just his lips and tongue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love to the depths, Elliott suddenly sucked on my neck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nibbled on my earlobe and whispered, "I really want to have you right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was trembling all over. At that moment, my mind completely went blank.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Elliott really wanted to do something to me, I was afraid I would not have any strength to refuse him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he restrained himself. He forcibly suppressed his lust, let me go, and then stayed alone for a while to calm down himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he hugged me again, kissed me gently on my forehead, and said softly, "Sleep. it's very late. See you in my dreams."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good night."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay quietly in Elliott's arms, feeling his sonorous and powerful heartbeat. I unconsciously put my legs on his knees, like an octopus clung to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deep love for Elliott that I had hidden in my heart was all seduced out tonight by his tenderness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but think back to the deep love I had for him all those years and the silly things I had done for him. At this moment, I was lying in his arms. This feeling was so real that I felt very dazed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was I really willing to give Elliott to Giselle?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I could let go of the grudges with him from my previous life and fall in love with him once, which would be considered as realizing my dream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, could I rewrite the ending of the story among me, Elliott, and Giselle?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly became greedy as never before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt attached to and reluctant to let go of Elliott again. Suddenly, I didn't want to give him to Giselle. Instead, I found that I selfishly wanted to own all his tenderness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at the same time, I realized that Elliott had never said "I love you" to me...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of feelings did Elliott have for me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With doubts, I fell asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the morning, I was woken up by his kiss. Elliott didn't get up until I opened my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and pinched my cheek. "Good morning, Madeline. Get up. It's time for us to set off."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sunlight in the morning shone on Elliott through the window. He wore white silk pajamas, and the soft light seemed to cast a faint halo around him, making him look like a prince coming from a fairy tale. After many years, his exquisite and flawless facial features still stunned me...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was so gentle to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was I really not dreaming?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rubbed my eyes in disbelief. Because I didn't get up, Elliott simply lifted the quilt and picked me up from the bed.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="208.html">« Prev</a><a href="210.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
