"Elliott, why are you here? Is Madeline okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a dress given by Elliott and a pearl necklace given by Laura. She ran to Elliott, stood beside him, and looked at me with extremely innocent eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Madeline, why are you crying? Did you not enjoy the dinner?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle really knew how to hurt people the most.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She apparently understood why I was sad, but now she pretended to be so innocent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, I wanted to step forward and slap her, but I could only endure it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed. Even if I failed, I couldn't admit defeat before Elliott's dream lover.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I straightened up, looked at Giselle, and said sarcastically, "No, I enjoyed it very much. This meal is worth remembering for a lifetime."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle pretended to be more innocent and even smiled sweetly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a meal. Madeline, if you like it, you can come to my house often, and I will treat you to anything you like."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also laughed, but my smile was extremely hypocritical.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mocked, "Okay, I will definitely go to your house more often. Rowan must often go to your place for dinner, too, right? I heard Adam say Rowan always stayed at your place when you were in college. It's definitely because Nicole is a good cook. If it were me, I would also want to live in your house."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle probably didn't expect me to mention Rowan. The smile on her face immediately vanished, as if a big secret of hers had been revealed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately argued, "Don't listen to Adam. Rowan has never stayed at my place."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Then why did Adam say he even loaned you five thousand dollars to have an abortion? It seems that Adam lied to me. I will ask him next time," I said, pretending to be calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's face suddenly turned gloomy. She probably didn't expect that I would expose her so ruthlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved her hands hurriedly and said at a loss, "How is that possible? Adam slandered me! Rowan and I have nothing to do with each other. I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Giselle could finish her explanation, Elliott's face had grown very serious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "Enough. Giselle, go back and tell Nicole that I appreciate her treat tonight. It's getting late, and we have to go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Elliott strode forward and held me in his arms before Giselle. He then took off his coat and put it on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what Madeline just said is not true. I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>GiselleI desperately wanted to explain, but Elliott ignored her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head and said to me, "Let's go home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, darling. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't quarrel with Elliott in front of Gisellel. Instead, I pretended to be close to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snuggling into Elliott's arms, I saw from the corner of my eye that GiselleI stood there, biting her lips, seeming to be on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to annoy me, but I wouldn't get irritated easily again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how Elliott hurt me or how Giselle provoked me, I would deal with it bravely in this life. I would never be as cowardly as I was in my last life.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="222.html">« Prev</a><a href="224.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
