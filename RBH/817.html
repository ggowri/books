It's pretty chilly out here, and there might be snakes lurking around."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said to him once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh-huh."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a soft affirmation. His gaze locked onto me, then, extinguishing the cigarette in his hand, he took a step forward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time we returned to the yard, everyone had already finished their drinks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and a few colleagues were busy tidying up the table, while Marcus and Quinn were nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about the two of them?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but ask, puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Both of them got absolutely hammered. They went into the room together, I reckon they're probably asleep by now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane said with a laugh, her face etched with kindness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who won then?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, I burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a draw. Both of them are evenly matched. They managed to finish this high-proof bottle of liquor."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane swirled the whiskey in her hand, then said with a grin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there any booze left?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Elliott, standing behind me, suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? Mr. Bryant, fancy a drink? We're out of the good stuff. But there's a bottle of wine left, a gift from the local villagers. If you're up for it, I can whip up a plate of crispy potato chips for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane immediately asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, the ever-picky Elliott actually agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's late. How about you stop drinking?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spun around to face him. Concern for his well-being gnawed at me, prompting an instinctive question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't sleep without a drink. Don't worry about me. You should get some rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott murmured, then promptly took a seat by the dining table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than Quinn's affability, he seemed to exude a chilling aura. As soon as he sat down, the other colleagues immediately stood up in restraint. They hastily retreated a few steps, then each found an excuse to skedaddle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was truly considerate. Before long, she whipped up a plate of crispy potato chips and served it up to Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, cradling a glass of wine and munching on Jane's homemade potato chips, was indulging himself under the cool moonlight, in the refreshing courtyard. His tall figure appeared profoundly lonely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched for a while. For reasons unknown, a subtle pang of reluctance lingered in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I moved forward, slowly taking a seat next to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ease up on the drink, Elliott."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but whisper a reminder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, and then, out of the blue, he reached out and affectionately ruffled my hair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, I suffer from insomnia. Besides alcohol, you're the only cure I've got."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Elliott spoke, his voice was as gentle as a whisper, his appearance pitiful in the extreme.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was somewhat moved. In that moment, the deep affection in his eyes was so intense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could deeply sense from his gaze, he yearned for me, he cared for me so much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't this exactly what I've always yearned for?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found myself staring at him, our gazes intertwining effortlessly. In that moment, it felt as if a hand had gently strummed the strings of my heart...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, out of the blue, I heard Quinn's voice beside me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I'm parched. Fetch me some water, will you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="816.html">« Prev</a><a href="818.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
