I couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, w-will you abandon me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the sway of alcohol, I boldly draped my arms around his and posed the question I dreaded most, adopting an exceedingly flirtatious tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're drunk. I'll take you home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was as evasive as ever, unwilling to answer my question directly. He lifted me off the sofa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a drunk woman must be heavier than usual. I couldn't exert any strength but made every effort to drag him into the sofa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I had ignored Quinn's presence in the room. Like an octopus, I dangled myself over Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intoxicated, I summoned the courage to ask a question that had long vexed me. I murmured coquettishly, "Elliott, tell me, do you love me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dim light, I couldn't see Elliott's expression clearly at all. However, his tone conveyed unmistakable hints of helplessness and a touch of affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, stop it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me. If you don't tell me, I won't go back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, relying on the indulgence in his words, I threw a tantrum like a child who had not grown up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, I had never experienced this feeling before. It was only tonight that I would like to be willful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Quinn is still here. Be good. I will carry you back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was unexpectedly good-tempered that night. He once again reached out his arms to hug me all over and lifted me directly from the sofa into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, just ignore me. I don't see or hear anything."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly waved his hands. He picked up a glass of red wine and, as if deliberately to avoid the scene, went out on the terrace again, leaving Elliott and me to watch his tall back.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you know it, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inebriated, I stared at his face. At the thought of that result, I suddenly felt inexplicably sad and couldn't help pouting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;In fact, in my mind, I had prepared myself for the cruelest thing.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I believed today might mark the turning point between Elliott and me, possibly signaling the end of our relationship. Yet, he remained present, showing no signs of blame, and willingly offered to take me home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admitted he captured my heart once again because of his unexpected tenderness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be mentally burdened. It's okay. I'm here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked down at me, as if he was promising something. His eyes shone in the dimness, and he was particularly firm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just felt that my heart was like a dead tree blooming, and his words rekindled all my passion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;At that moment, with an unaccountable surge of courage, I caught him by the neck again and proactively then kissed him.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Elliott probably never expected that I would suddenly take such initiative.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could complete his sentence, I silenced him with a kiss. Unsure if it was the alcohol or the intoxication of love, I found myself voluntarily this time, with a passion I had never experienced before, almost bordering on an enthusiasm I had never known...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="261.html">« Prev</a><a href="263.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
