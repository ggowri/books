It seemed that he had already left, and I couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But little did I know, when I finished washing up and walked downstairs, Elliott was still sitting in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a bit awkward...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood on the stairs, hesitating whether to go downstairs or not, while Elliott had obviously heard my footsteps. He turned his head, glanced at me indifferently, and said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you standing there? Come down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"OK."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could only reply, slowly walking down the stairs to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sitting on the sofa, dressed in a black suit. He still exuded a strong aura all over his body, and he was still elegant and handsome, not looking a real mess like he was last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his eye circles did look a bit dark...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was sure that he must have stayed up late last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of what happened last night, I almost burst out laughing, but I felt it would be impolite, so I quickly covered my mouth and pretended to yawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why haven't you gone to work yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at me angrily, his tone still filled with strong dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nervously pretended to flick my hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last night, there must have been something wrong with the soup your mom gave you. I simply followed the method you used last time to deal with me and neutralized the effect for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his head, and his deep eyes, accentuated by dark circles, appeared even more profound. He said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to hide my embarrassment with a laugh, "That's not necessary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The dinner tonight is very important. You caused me not to sleep well last night. Tell me, how are you going to make up for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held his hands and stared at me, asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Make up for it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What could I do to compensate him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a bit confused, and then suddenly I remembered that there was a bottle of eye cream in my bag, which I had just bought and hadn't opened yet. It had a certain effect in removing dark circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I immediately took it out and waved it in front of Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just bought this eye cream, and it hasn't been opened yet. Or, would you like to give it a try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obviously didn't expect that my compensation would be this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unhappy again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, but couldn't do anything to me. His thin lips tightened, and his voice grew colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, then come over here. I want you to personally apply it on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words clearly hid a knife, indicating that he truly harbored a lot of hatred in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I couldn't help but secretly enjoy it in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found that I was increasingly fond of the way he hated me and couldn't get rid of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put down my bag, took out the eye cream from its packaging box, walked over, and squatted in front of him. He placed both hands on his knees and leaned forward towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lightly dipped my finger in some eye cream, gesturing for him to close his eyes. Then, I gently applied it around the corners of his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes slightly, and his long eyelashes covered his eyelids like a fan. From a close distance, his skin looked really good, deserving of a man who was accustomed to a life of luxury. His complexion was even more delicate than that of a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I made a few clockwise circles around his eyes with my fingers, spreading the eye cream evenly. Then, I gently made a few back-and-forth movements. After that, I whispered softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, it's done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He subconsciously opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood up and was just about to keep some distance from him, but unexpectedly, he suddenly grabbed my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are your hands so cold?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He not only didn't blame me for treating him like that last night but cared about whether my hands were cold or not. This was the first time ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was immediately taken aback and wanted to break free, but he held onto my hand and placed it in his palms, rubbing it back and forth a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm sensation instantly spread from my palms as I looked at him, and for a moment, I had no idea what he was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shouldn't he have been very angry about what happened last night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was he starting to show tenderness towards me again now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men were truly perplexing creatures!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="45.html">« Prev</a><a href="47.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
