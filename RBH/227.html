Then, he buttoned it for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but say, "You look quite good in my trench coat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his compliment, I couldn't help but laugh. Honestly, I did feel a lot warmer after putting on his coat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a nice smell on his coat, not like perfume, but it smelled very good. This smell was always unique to him, making people feel inexplicably relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While we walked side by side, Quinn asked, "I knew you and Elliott went hiking two days ago. You should be happy. Why are you so depressed?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he had seen the photos of Flora Moutain that Elliott had posted on Twitter. I was in Louis City, so even if he couldn't see my posts, he was clever and could guess Elliott had gone to Louis City and found me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just feel that I am quite useless. I have decided to get over him, but as soon as he gets close to me, I find I can't do it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled helplessly. Unknowingly, I had treated Quinn as a friend with whom I could share my thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you feel like you couldn't resist him when he was nice to you? This is normal. You're a hopeless romantic," Quinn said bluntly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so angry that I punched him in the chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? No!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is an undeniable fact. If he treated you with the same attitude as before, you might have gotten over him a long time ago. But recently, he has been caring about you. So, you waver, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was like a sober bystander. H wasn't around me and Elliott all the time, yet it seemed like he knew clearly what happened between us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him in disbelief and said, "How come you know everything? Quinn, I doubt you installed surveillance around me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does a person like me, a master of relationships, need to monitor you? "Quinn smiled, "I could tell what you are thinking from your tweets, expressions, and body language and where you are with Elliott."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think things can work out between Elliott and me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly stopped and looked at the crescent moon melancholy. At that moment, I didn't know why I would ask him such a question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was stunned for a few seconds.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he asked, "Do you want the truth or a lie?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I want the truth!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn suddenly sighed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he said meaningfully, "Don't you think some things are destined? You will not be happy if you force it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't answer my question, but the meaning of his words was extremely obvious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned, as if someone had spoken about what I was thinking. I turned around and looked at Quinn. At that moment, I felt an urge to cry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Acutally, I had known the answer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't need others to tell me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An inexplicable sadness suddenly emerged, and my tears rolled down instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you crying again? You are so fragile."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn panicked. He quickly took out a tissue, stepped forward, and wiped the tears from my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cried suddenly, putting him at a loss, and we were very close unconsciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, a familiar and calm voice came from behind us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are strolling down the street late at night. You must be in a good mood."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="226.html">« Prev</a><a href="228.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
