Go to the hospital quickly and ask Fiona to see you!]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing Paige's message, I quickly replied to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I don't dare to move at all. Damn Philip, I really want to beat him!]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige sent several angry emojis in succession, which showed her anger right now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Then you just wait for me. I'll come and take you to the hospital.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly replied. At the same time, I found Fiona didn't reply to my message, so I kept sending her more messages.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Fiona sent me a voice message. Her voice was hoarse and lazy. It seemed she was still sleeping.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I'm studying abroad, so I'm still sleeping now. Paige, you can go to my hospital. I will ask my colleague to see you. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rolled down the window and shouted to Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing I was awake, Elliott quickly came over and opened the car door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the reflection of the rising sun, he didn't look tired after all night's work. Instead, he looked energetic! He gave me a rare bright smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you awake? Are you tired?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so tired, but I couldn't say that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blushed with embarrassment and didn't dare to look into his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige said she had a stomachache, but no one can't accompany her to the hospital. So I want to go with her. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll take you there," Elliott replied positively and simply.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, no, you just take me to my house. I can drive my own car. It's not very convenient for a man to get involved in women's matters," I said quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me with a simper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you can drive by yourself?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that his question had another meaning. I was so ashamed that I wanted to find a crack in the ground and crawled into it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, please drive quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my red face, he finally stopped teasing me. He quickly got into the cab and drove me away from the coastal road.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too late last night that I couldn't appreciate this beautiful scenery along the way. At this moment, I realized how beautiful the coastal road was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at this beautiful scenery through the car window and listened to the music played in the car. The slightly salty sea breeze blew my hair. So I raised my hand to remove them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Elliott stretched out one hand and inadvertently clasped his fingers with mine. I turned my head subconsciously and found that both of us looked at each other and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It will be Christmas in two weeks. At that time, let's go back to Bryant Villa together, " Elliott said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words reminded me of the passing days. How time flew! It turned out that Christmas would be celebrated in two weeks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to Bryant Villa? "Thinking of Laura's attitude, I was hesitant. "I'm afraid that your parents and grandfather would not be happy to see me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I will be with you there. "Elliott's tone was very firm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's decide it later. I hope my dad can wake up before Christmas."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded. I couldn't help but think of my father who was still lying in the hospital. My heart suddenly became heavy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It will definitely happen. Otherwise, you can transfer your father to another hospital. I will arrange for several authoritative experts to conduct a joint consultation on him to find out the causes of his disease as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had once again mentioned the idea of transferring my father to another hospital. I understood that if I refused him again, he would have other thoughts in mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering the hospital where Fiona worked had not cured my father so far, I pondered for a while and said, "Okay, I'll discuss this issue with my mother later. If she agrees, I will transfer my father to another hospital."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I will talk with the Bryant Hospital about this. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Receiving my agreement, Elliott's voice was full of excitement. He held my hand tighter.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="337.html">« Prev</a><a href="339.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
