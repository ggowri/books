In a few months, she will find out that the child she tried so hard to save has Down syndrome. She may be even more devastated by that time," Paige sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's none of our business. No matter what, let's raise our babies well. Time flies so fast, and we both will become a mother soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was pregnant and didn't want to say too many vicious words for fear that it would be bad for the baby, so I changed the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what I said, Paige immediately touched her belly with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, sometimes I find it incredible when the baby moves around in my belly. I never thought about getting married before. I didn't expect that I would become a mother soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have always longed to be pregnant, but I didn't expect that the baby would come when I had no hope."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also caressed my belly, feeling a little sad when I thought about all the things I had experienced during this period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, we heard Paige's name being called, so I accompanied her into the B-ultrasonic room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been pregnant for more than six months, and through a four-dimensional color ultrasound, she could see her baby's hands and feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a big screen in the B-ultrasonic room, and we stared at the baby on the screen. The doctor explained where the head and feet of the baby were. The more I listened, the more I felt that giving birth to life was a magical thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After more than ten minutes of examination, the doctor told Paige that the baby was developing well, and everything was normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the news, we both breathed a long sigh of relief and smiled happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We took the report and left the B-ultrasonic room, planning to let Fiona confirm it again. Unexpectedly, when we walked out, we saw Laura still waiting at the door of the B-ultrasonic room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She misunderstood that I was having a check-up in the room, so as soon as she saw me, she ran over and said with concern, "Madeline, what are the inspection results? Is everything okay with the baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This baby has nothing to do with your family, so you don't need to worry about it. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Laura pretending to be friendly, I felt disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I know you are still angry with me, so you said that on purpose. I can understand. It was my fault before, and I will definitely make up for it in the future. If you want to eat something, just tell me, and I will buy it immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura rubbed her hands excitedly, still immersed in the joy of me being pregnant with the kid of her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew I could never persuade her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her like this, I didn't say anything more, so I just glanced at her coldly and wanted to walk out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't expect that just when I was about to leave with Paige, the scene in front of me suddenly made me stunned.
