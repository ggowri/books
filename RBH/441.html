However, after typing the word "divorce", I still felt heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, </span><span>w</span><span>e finally made it to this day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at the screen, I drafted the divorce agreement with highly complicated emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ending the emotions of the past few years with cold words, I realized that, in fact, there was little connection between me and Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We didn't buy a house or car together, so we had no common interests. Moreover, without children, we could draw a line easily without any barriers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that negotiation with Laura, I knew they couldn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t return return the two billion dollars to me in full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Bryant Group and the Glory Group had many interactions over the years, so it was hard to define the nature of that money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I planned to forget it. I would consider it as the price I paid for my youth and ignorance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I drafted the divorce agreement quickly. After multiple confirmations, I sent it to Elliott via mail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Adam opened the door to my office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This young guy was always fully energetic. He was wearing a broad smile, looking bright and beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I have great news for you! Due to the recent negative news about Jezebel, Netflix has canceled its cooperation with Allure. This morning, Netflix urgently launched a war-type TV series. Allure has no hope of winning at all, so Do Not Love is certain to be No.1!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam looked extremely happy. But I just raised my eyebrows after hearing the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, everything was already within my expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did such a big favor for Rickson that night. This could be considered as his return gift to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Continue to keep an eye on them to see if they will take other actions next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slightly smiling, I said while cupping my chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I got it. But I feel it is hard to meet with success. Because Netflix is a signal for the entertainment industry. Since Netflix has dared not launch this TV series, other platforms have dared not take this risk. Moreover, with the recent increase in restrictions on TV series with historical themes, many TV stations have decided to focus on war-themed TV dramas. If Allure misses this opportunity, it won't be easy to succeed. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam analyzed with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam didn't know this victory was the result of my secret manipulation. He thought it was God helping us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After these days, the company is going to have an annual leave, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at the calendar, I found that time flew by so fast. Unconsciously, Christmas was almost there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Most of the employees will be on vacation the day after tomorrow, but some employees will stay on duty. The Human Resources Department arranged it well. So, Madeline, you don't have to worry about it. By the way, I heard that Mr. Austin Mayers has already woken up. How is he feeling now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Then your holiday will begin the day after tomorrow. You can relax. My dad is fine. He is getting better day by day, and he should be cured soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While nodding, I looked at Adam, feeling a little relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just graduated, but he had great potential. He had grown rapidly during the time he had been working with me. The most important thing was that he was not impetuous but reliable, so I felt at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already bought the air ticket to Alaska, and I'm planning to travel to Alaska with Rowan during Christmas. Madeline, would you like to hang out with us to relax? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam winked at me, saying with a smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="440.html">« Prev</a><a href="442.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
