You go ahead and enjoy yourself; I've got some things to attend to first," Quinn said with a grin, leaning in close to my ear. As the host of this party, he clearly had tasks to handle. After leading me into the venue, he quickly disappeared into the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my mask on, I wandered casually through the colorful scene. A waiter passed by, and I grabbed a glass of crimson-colored drink from his tray, curious about its taste. It was tangy and sweet, and I must say it was quite delicious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a girl dressed as an angel grabbed my arm and said, "Hey, gorgeous. You seem to be alone. Why don't you join us for a dance? We're short of one person."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She, too, wore a mask, so that I couldn't see her face, but her sweet voice sounded friendly. Since I didn't have any company anyway, I nodded readily and joined their group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a lively group of five young and energetic girls, totaling six, including me. After a brief introduction to the rules, I quickly joined in the dance with them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took dancing lessons when I was a kid, so I had a solid foundation in dancing. Although I was a bit rusty at first, I quickly caught on to their rhythm. Dancing with them became increasingly exhilarating, to the point where our group suddenly found itself surrounded by several young men in eccentric robes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These men, all dressed in identical black robes and masks, appeared tall and imposing. Judging by their attire, they seemed to be portraying wizards.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, our private booth is over there. Would you honor us with your presence and join us for a few drinks?" the leader of the men said to us. His voice sounded strangely familiar, almost like Philip's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Philip also here? I couldn't help but wonder as I discreetly scrutinized the figure in the black robe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the robes were too loose, and apart from their towering height, I couldn't discern any distinguishing features. So, I remained silent, quietly waiting to see how the other girls would respond.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl who had invited me to join them seemed to be quite playful herself, and seeing someone initiate a conversation, she smiled and said, "Sure, but we'll only drink the most expensive wine here. Can you afford that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, that's not a problem," the young man replied promptly, then made a gentlemanly gesture of invitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone, his mannerisms, and the swagger in his speech led me to believe that it was most likely Philip himself behind the mask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already had something going on with Paige, yet he continued to delay facing reality. Seeing him flirt with other girls now just made me mad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I quietly followed the other girls and sat down with the boys at their booth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once seated, I discreetly took out my phone, snapped a picture of the leader in the black robe, and sent it to Quinn along with a message that read, "Is this Philip?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="271.html">« Prev</a><a href="273.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
