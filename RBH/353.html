She couldn't help but chuckle as she watched our playful banter and called out from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, be careful not to twist your ankle in those high heels. Don't rush!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it's okay. We're off."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I replied and hurried out the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Elliott was still irritated, he patiently waited for me to get into the car before signaling Toby to drive off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat beside Elliott, and he instinctively squeezed my hand tightly. At that moment, I noticed something peculiar. Toby, the usually stoic and focused driver, briefly glanced at us through the rearview mirror.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His seemed to be weirdly surprised. However, he only took a quick glance and then concentrated on driving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby had been Elliott's driver for many years, known for his honesty and reserved nature. Despite being half-siblings with Giselle, he was different in character from her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fleeting glance he shot me was odd, but with Elliott present, I chose to let it go without question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Toby pulled up at the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott exited the car first before offering me his hand to assist me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised me, however, was his subsequent gesture. For the first time, he extended his arm to invite me to take it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott typically shied away from public displays of affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but feel a little startled. Finally, I took his arm and accompanied him into Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While I had visited the Bryant Group on numerous occasions, it was the first time I did so arm-in-arm with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Employees turned to stare at us, their faces reflecting surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greetings filled the air, accompanied by whispered discussions about us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant brought his wife to work today? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant is so slender, tall, and stunning. She seems completely transformed!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you know that Mrs. Bryant is preparing to inherit her father's company? She's now a powerhouse in the business world, a perfect match for Mr. Bryant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They seem so affectionate. Despite what people say about Mr. Bryant not loving Mrs. Bryant, I think they're very much in love."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, the hearts of the girls in the company who adored Mr. Bryant will be broken now. The sweetness between Mr. and Mrs. Bryant is undeniable."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These comments, though subtle, reached my ears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I paid no attention to them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, Elliott and I made our way to his office. The scent of lilies filled the air as we stepped inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you're here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard a sweet and familiar voice with a hint of excitement in the office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, dressed in a white professional suit, emerged from Elliott's office.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="352.html">« Prev</a><a href="354.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
