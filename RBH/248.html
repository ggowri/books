His law firm was housed in a small white building, standing out in the midst of old buildings. While the exterior seemed ordinary, stepping inside, I noticed the interior was meticulously designed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis gave Fiona and me a brief tour, revealing that this building was left by his grandfather, later converted into a law firm. He hadn't altered the exterior but renovated the interior to his liking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occupying the entire top floor, Alexis' office was particularly spacious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, like Fiona, he had a strong work ethic. His office resembled a home, not only grand in layout but also featuring a coffee shop, study, and living room. Alexis mentioned that he was sometimes too busy to go home, so he worked here, which was quite convenient.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We settled in at his coffee shop, and he quickly brewed us some coffee.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona glanced around before giving me a signal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you two stays for coffee? Madeline and I will take a look around." Fiona suggested.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, feel free to explore," Alexis said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott nodded, indicating that I should accompany Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona and I had been friends for many years, so when she gave me a look, I knew exactly what she was thinking. Fiona felt that discussing business with Alexis and Elliott was boring and preferred that we chatted alone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I stood up, linked arms with Fiona, and strolled around Alexis's law firm together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as we left, Fiona immediately pinched my cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what's going on between you and Elliott? I feel like your relationship has been strange lately."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when I was injured some time ago, Fiona had arranged for my transfer to another hospital. She knew I was still upset with Elliott, so she found our current dynamic peculiar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and whispered, "I don't know what's going on either. Fiona, what would you think if I told you I want to have a baby with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind?" Fiona's voice immediately rose, but then she quickly lowered it. "What's going on? Weren't you adamant about getting a divorce not long ago? Why bring up having a baby now? Do you realize the lifelong commitment that having a child entails? Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know how to explain it to you, Fiona," I said with a wry smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, only Quinn knew the complexities between me and Giselle, and I wasn't sure how to explain it to Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona frowned, "Do you have some ulterior motive? Is it because of a family alliance?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just that. Fiona, let's talk about it another time. Since I ran into you today, could you give me some advice on preparing for a pregnancy?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I changed the subject directly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like you're really determined, but Madeline, you must think this through. Once you're pregnant, there's no turning back. If you're serious about having a baby, I can prescribe some medication for you. If you've been trying for a while without success, we can consider more targeted treatments."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="247.html">« Prev</a><a href="249.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
