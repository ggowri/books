However, our area and their area happened to be separated by a forest, so this side was kind of isolated, more suitable for chatting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had long wanted this opportunity, so I immediately began discussing the details of collaboration with Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and Grey had already set up the barbecue at this time. Soon, the smell of grilled meat wafted over from their side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin was a straightforward person, concise and to the point. We quickly agreed on details such as the cooperation price and mode. Shortly afterward, he directly called the legal department of his company and explained the details, urging them to promptly prepare the contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was deeply grateful for Benjamin's trust in working with me, and at the same time, I let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, there was no longer any connection between Elliott and me, neither emotionally nor professionally. At the end of the month, my contract with them would </span><span>have ended, so there were no more ties between him and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the discussion, I stood up and gratefully shook hands with Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Benjamin, I really appreciate your trust in Glory Group and willingness to collaborate with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were already a family, so naturally I couldn't give the benefits to outsiders. To be honest, my product is in high demand in the market right now, and there are many manufacturers who want to place orders. However, Grey said that I must prioritize working with you. I dare not disobey Grey's command."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's bright smile was just like Grey's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as soon as he finished speaking, Grey immediately turned around. The two of them exchanged a smile. They have been married for many years, but I could feel that their love had not dissipated, and it had deepened and become purer, like a fine wine that grows richer and more refined with the passage of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, this kind of love, growing old together with each other, was also what I longed for in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If possible, how I wish I could choose the right person to grow old together, to walk through an ordinary life together, to bear the joys and sorrows bestowed by time together, and to have children together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it seemed, my wish could probably only remain a wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life was sometimes strange. The more people desperately pursue something, the more likely they will fail, just like it was impossible to keep sand in one's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, I no longer had any longing for love in my mind. That obsession, like a rope tied around my heart, had been forcefully broken by Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I cooked your favorite beef, it is very tender. Come and try it!" Quinn suddenly shouted at me excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While I was lost in thought, his voice disturbed me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly came to my senses. However, when I looked up, the hilarious scene in front of me instantly made me burst into laughter!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="630.html">« Prev</a><a href="632.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
