No one expected it. Don't be too sad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly heard Quinn's voice. He patted my shoulder and softly comforted me as if he understood all of my emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not sad. Don't think you know everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, any consolation sounded like irony, and I didn't want anyone to see through my thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to my words, Quinn just looked at me meaningfully with a hint of pity in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he softly said, "Do you want to go to the hospital? I'll give you a ride."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a moment. Let's first figure out why that waiter suddenly did that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, and sanity gradually returned to me. I hadn't forgotten my current identity. An unexpected incident happened at the banquet, and I needed to figure out why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Quinn replied in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Paige also came. Both of them stood by me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police arrived soon. After learning about the situation, they took the waiter back. The three of us also went to the police station with the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the interrogation, the waiter soon confessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that his father worked at a construction site under a subsidiary of the Bryant Group six months ago. While working, his father accidentally fell from a height and became paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bryant Group gave a large sum of money to their family, but the waiter liked gambling and soon lost everything. He then attempted to extort the company in his father's name, but his unreasonable demands were rejected by the Bryant Group. As a result, he harbored a grudge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a huge debt that he couldn't repay, which led to resentment towards Elliott. Therefore, he worked as a waiter here, waiting for an opportunity to hurt Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wicked and desperate gambler could do everything. Fortunately, the whole incident was not complicated. The police stated that they would file a case and ensure that the waiter would receive the punishment he deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the matter was resolved, Quinn and Paige accompanied me as we walked out of the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn could tell that I was upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Do you want to go to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, sure," I said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I got into Quinn's Maybach with Paige, feeling tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who was that girl? How could she happen to save Elliott just in time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, Paige asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head. After all, everything happened so fast. I didn't see clearly what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was probably just a coincidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn whispered as he drove, occasionally casting glances toward me. I knew he was looking at me, but I didn't even have the mood to respond to his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why I felt so upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't I already know that Elliott and Giselle were destined to meet and fall in love?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why did I still feel sad when this scene really happened in front of me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Do I still love Elliott?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impossible. The moment I was reborn, I swore that I would never love him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I just felt bad that I gave so much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was unwilling to be defeated by a young college student who had nothing. I was unwilling to give up like this. I had loved Elliott for so long, yet he didn't care about me at all... That could explain why I was upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was lost in my thoughts when we arrived at the entrance of the hospital.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="57.html">« Prev</a><a href="59.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
