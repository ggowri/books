Elliott really helped us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother quickly smiled and agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott just offered a gift and said a few nice words, and to my surprise, my parents were completely swayed by him and spoke exactly as he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but roll my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I knew that Elliott and I were not that close, we were still married and I didn't want my parents to worry about our marriage prematurely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I had to try my best to hold back my anger. However, I still gave Elliott a hard kick under the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat on the chair. The moment I stepped on it, I saw his mouth twitch, but he surprisingly didn't get angry. He continued to smile, without letting my parents notice anything wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents enjoyed this meal very much, especially my dad. He drank a lot of red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott accompanied my dad and drank quite a bit of alcohol. After dinner, he sat on the sofa chatting with my dad. Meanwhile, I quickly tidied up two pieces of clothing and came downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother pulled me aside and advised, "Madeline, don't worry so much. Not everything between couples needs to be said clearly. Sometimes, you have to turn a blind eye, that's how you will be happy, you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I understand, don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you had to learn to grow up slowly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother patted my shoulder. At that moment, Elliott stood up and walked towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I guess tonight he probably deliberately wanted to show our affection in front of my parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he came over, he grabbed my hand and led me out of my parents' house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Toby was still waiting outside the door, while my parents had also prepared the gifts and had them stuffed into the trunk of the car early on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car Elliott drove today was a Kouri Nan, and this car had been parked in the garage before. Perhaps he felt that the Lincoln limousine parked in front of my house was too flashy, so he drove this car instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, Lily, then I took Madeline home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood upright in front of the car. He still tightly held my hand, as if he were afraid that I would not leave with him, no matter how hard I tried to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, see you next time. I just put a box of red velvet cake in your trunk, it was made by your dad's comrade, Madeline's favorite red velvet cake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom became even happier when she saw how much Elliott cared about me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, goodbye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching my parents so happy tonight, I couldn't bear to say anything that would make them feel uncomfortable anymore. So, I pretended to snuggle up next to Elliott and happily waved at my parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, once I got in the car, I immediately shook off Elliott's hand and at the same time, I quickly moved to a corner of the back seat, trying to keep enough distance from Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What were you doing? Am I a hedgehog? Why were you so far away from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned and moved towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly waved my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, it's over. Why did you bring me back? What was your intention?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="77.html">« Prev</a><a href="79.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
