I know Madeline is scared of thunder, so I came to check on her. Is everyone okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn walked in with a big box of snacks, smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're fine, but Elliott is here too. Just so you know, we didn't want to let him in, but the rain was too heavy. You young people sort it out yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom quickly distanced herself from the situation, explaining right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn spotted Elliott at the dining table, enjoying his meal. His smile froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he soon understood the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie, can the three of us talk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's tone was calm and restrained, not impulsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, but I don't want any arguments here. Also, Quinn, regardless of what Madeline thinks, I don't support her getting back with Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom patted Quinn's shoulder, seemingly encouraging him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing my mom, I felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, the rain continued, showing signs of a comeback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn brought my favorite lobster, which I rarely eat. As he opened the box, the familiar spicy aroma filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out disposable gloves, placing them in front of Elliott and me, then sat beside me, across from Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes tensed up. He looked at Quinn, his lips moving:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, there are plenty of seats. Why sit next to Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice carried a hint of displeasure, though he didn't fully express it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled slightly, put on the gloves, and started peeling the lobster. He skillfully placed the meat into my bowl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His actions were smooth and natural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This brought back memories of past years when Quinn would always sit beside me during lobster season, peeling the shells and placing the meat in my bowl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was always a gentleman, caring for me and others at the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, I got used to it, thinking peeling shrimp was a man's job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, seeing Quinn place the lobster in my bowl in front of Elliott, I realized only Quinn had ever treated me with such care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even my dad, who loves me dearly, had done this for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't answer Elliott's question but showed him through his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night was long, and their eyes burned with hidden anger. Quinn said calmly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're here tonight, it means your memory is either fully back or you know everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know everything," Elliott replied bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, let's talk. Madeline has decided to be with me. You and she were in love, but that's the past. I hope you understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's voice was deep, his hands still peeling the lobster, but his words were firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face fell. He grabbed Quinn's hand holding the lobster, his voice turning cold:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, Madeline hasn't decided who to be with. At least, she hasn't told me directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" Quinn asked calmly, then turned to me, eyes full of certainty. "Madeline, will you tell him what you told me that day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't mentally prepared for Quinn to ask me to clarify in front of Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I had promised Quinn before. I said once Elliott's memory returned, I would be with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the bowl filled with shrimp, I thought of all the subtle kindness Quinn had shown me over the years. My heart felt heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my past, I owed Elliott nothing, but I owed Quinn so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a stormy night, he remembered my fear of thunder, knew I loved lobster, and peeled all the shrimp for me without tasting any himself. He always put me first. If I kept hurting him, I'd be going too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Elliott...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admit, that his recent actions and words moved me. But I once swore I'd never be with Elliott again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I should follow my heart. Wavering any longer would be unfair to Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, my resolve strengthened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and softly said, "I remember saying that once Elliott's memory returned and my life was back to normal, we would be together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gasped, standing up from his chair, and looking at me in disbelief, his eyes darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath, mustered my courage, and looked him in the eye, saying calmly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, now that you know everything, I won't fear hurting you. We're even. For the rest of my life, I don't want to be entangled with you. I just want peace. I hope you understand."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="912.html">« Prev</a><a href="914.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
