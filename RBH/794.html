I just kept staring at his face, entranced.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not sure if it's because the effects of the drug are gradually wearing off, or because the hangover cure is slowly kicking in, but I can now clearly see his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's been a while since I've taken such a close look at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up close, his face still held a captivating, almost bewitching charm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to have left no trace on his face. Despite being a man in his early thirties, his features remained as chiseled and profound as ever, irresistibly drawing people in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scenario seems eerily familiar, doesn't it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I think I've been drunk before. There was also a time when I was so desperate that I drugged myself, hoping to earn his pity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he seemed to have done the same, hauling me into the bathroom and dousing me with water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his actions were gentler, more considerate&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I didn't respond, just gazing at him in a daze, he suddenly let out a soft sigh. Then, he took a few deep breaths, as if trying to rein in his desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept me company while I soaked in the bathtub for a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was sprawled on him, basking in a warmth that was soft and comforting. It felt so good. I lay still, like a baby yearning for affection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, sleepiness began to creep in, and the itchiness within my body gradually started to fade away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel him rising from the bathtub. After he slipped into a clean bathrobe, he swaddled me in a bath towel. He cradled me gently, carrying me from the bathroom to the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still don't have an ounce of strength in my body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the wardrobe, and to my surprise, he pulled out my old pajamas.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, he still kept my stuff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yanked off my bathrobe, then gingerly slipped me into my pajamas.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slowly coming to my senses, finally realizing what had happened. Panic started to creep in. I had never intended to rekindle anything with Elliott, so why on earth was I standing bare before him again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a bloody hell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I wanted to struggle. But oddly enough, I couldn't muster any strength in my limbs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay motionless on the bed, eyes wide open as he dressed me in my pajamas, pulling on my underwear and pants. My limbs were immobile, but my gaze towards him was filled with defiance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he gazed at me tenderly, playfully brushing his hand against my nose. A gentle smile graced his face:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little kitty, you've finally settled down. Sleep now, I won't disturb you, rest assured."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he could read my mind, Elliott was exceptionally rational. He didn't overstep even a bit throughout the whole process.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His restraint earned him a smidgen of my affection... Had he touched me that night, I fear a colossal shadow would have forever clouded my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this is not what I had in mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stirred once more. He pulled out a set of pajamas from the wardrobe, matching the ones I was wearing. They were couple's pajamas, a previous purchase of mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right before my eyes, he shrugged off his bathrobe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his back was to me, his towering figure and the distinct lines of his muscles were still clearly displayed before my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We're like an old married couple who've been living together for ages. He doesn't hold back anything in front of me. Just like that, he unabashedly flaunts his impressive physique before me, leaving no angle hidden.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That deep-seated desire within me was nearly stirred up again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily shut my eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="793.html">« Prev</a><a href="795.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
