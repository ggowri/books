Absolutely."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This girl named Lucy said in a delicate manner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was on the verge of uttering Elliott's name, but a squeeze on her hand from Lisa made her clamp her mouth shut, leaving the name unspoken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy, my mind races... Could it be, Lucy, the daughter of Mr. Ailton, the once shining star of the media industry in Hoswich city?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when I married Elliott, the Bryant family had intentions of forming an alliance through marriage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment the Ailton family heard that the Bryant family was in financial trouble, they immediately announced that Lucy was already engaged to someone else, brutally humiliating the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In recent years, with the rise of the internet, newspapers and magazines are gradually becoming obsolete. Their group's profits are dwindling. Not long ago, I heard she got divorced and is now raising a three-year-old daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Lisa have brought her here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is she planning to turn all my enemies into her friends?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey had a strong distaste for women who came here with an agenda.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after some persuasion from the men, she agreed to let them join the afternoon match temporarily. But according to the rules of the game, they were not eligible to compete. They could only watch from the sidelines, without any scores.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lisa and Lucy showed up, Elliott was in the middle of a conversation with someone else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He failed to notice the addition of two women to the group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I returned from the restroom, I saw him heading straight for Lisa. He walked up behind her, casually wrapping his arms around her from the back:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, aren't you tired from standing so long? Take a break if you need to."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately coughed twice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the sound, Elliott instantly let go of Lisa's hand as if jolted by electricity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to me, he looked awkward. Then, with a displeased expression, he turned his gaze to Lisa:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How come you're here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Lisa was about to explain, the ever-silent Lucy beside her sprang into action. The moment she laid eyes on Elliott, tears streamed down her face and her body trembled. In front of everyone, she ran straight to Elliott, choking out words through her sobs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, after all these years, I've finally found you. Back then, I was completely forced by my father. I heard you're divorced now, so am I. Could we perhaps find a chance to talk privately? I'd like to explain everything to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Grey silently moved to my side, whispering softly into my ear:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you've got another love rival. She's got a bit of a past with Elliott. Think it through, Madeline. Elliott is incredibly attractive. Not like Quinn, who, despite his good looks, is actually quite innocent."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lucy, who told you I was divorced? Who?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face suddenly turned cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the clear skies, the aura of gloom he exuded turned the entire scene chillingly cold, as if winter had suddenly descended.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="890.html">« Prev</a><a href="892.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
