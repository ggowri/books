What time is your flight? I'll have my assistant book mine." I said to him, my tone casual.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've got my mindset all sorted out, so whatever Elliott says won't ruffle my feathers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already booked it for you, a flight from Vespera City to Hoswich City at one in the afternoon. Let's go, we're heading to Vespera City first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I helped Elliott with his discharge paperwork. Then, Barry, behind the wheel, whisked us away from the small hospital, steering us towards Vespera City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All along the way, Elliott was quietly leaning against the plush leather seat in the back. He didn't speak, just silently gazing out the window.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was a mask of calm, but a storm was brewing inside him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no clue what was going on in his mind, but I didn't ask. Probably due to the exhaustion from last night, it didn't take long before I leaned back in my chair, closing my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time I close my eyes, all I see are the moments I spent with Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've never really given much thought to anything before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to me, I found that Quinn had permeated every aspect of my life over the years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems like no matter what happens or when, he's always right there by my side. He's helped me out more times than I can count, and brought me endless joy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige advised, "Marry a man who treats you exceptionally well. Rather than seeking someone you love, find someone who loves you. It will make your latter life much happier." This advice carries the flavor of a Western online novel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona said, "In this day and age, genuine guys like Quinn are few and far between. So, you better cherish him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily remarked, "Quinn is really quite something. Most importantly, he always puts you first, making you his top priority."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've only just realized that Quinn, with his charismatic personality, has managed to charm nearly every woman around me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, as I stand by Elliott's side, I realize that I'm slowly falling for Quinn too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to believe that being moved was not the same as being in love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in life, many people end up together, all because they were moved at the beginning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you find yourself moved, it means they truly care for you.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in my thoughts, I was jolted back to reality when Elliott gently placed my head on his sturdy shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I caught a whiff of that familiar masculine scent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott must have thought I was sound asleep, worried about my rest, he deliberately moved closer, offering his shoulder as my pillow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I snapped back to reality immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation left me feeling a tad awkward. Thankfully, I could feign sleep with my eyes closed, easing the discomfort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, once we hit the airport, grab some cookies and coffee. Madeline can have them on the plane."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard Elliott's voice, deliberately hushed, probably afraid to wake me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Mr. Bryant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline prefers tranquility. Why don't you grab a pair of earplugs? That way, she can get a decent sleep on the plane."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott paused for a moment, then murmured his instructions once more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When did he start paying attention to my preferences?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback when I suddenly heard him giving orders to Barry like that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just then, he gently placed me on his lap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even took off his jacket, draping it over me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="824.html">« Prev</a><a href="826.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
