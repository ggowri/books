You underestimate me too much, Madeline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was close to me. It was obvious that Delin had come, and she was right behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was extremely frightened. I turned around, and when I saw her face clearly, I couldn't help but tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Delin to be Jade, my favorite cousin. She had secretly transferred a lot of assets from Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she transferred a lot of money, she completely disappeared in Hoswich city. Later, I never heard about her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, she had actually become Delin. She settled down in Mexico and established the 731 Group, engaging in illegal business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her appearance hasn't changed, but there was a scar on her face. Her skin wasn't as delicate as before, and I noticed that she had tattoos on her chest and arms, just like the tattooed man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her! In an instant, I could understand everything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder she knew my information so well. She knew who I was close to, and she also knew how to deceive me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since that person was not Quinn, it indicates that their intention was not Quinn. On one hand, they could obtain 10 million dollars, and on the other hand, they wanted to deceive me into coming here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately understood everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Jade for a long time before finally saying slowly, "Jade, long time no see. I heard that you went abroad, but I never expected you to be in Mexico. It really surprised me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's so surprising about this? Mexico is great. It's not often that you come to Norch City, so it's perfect. I'll show you around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade looked at me and said with a strange smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed her eyes. I felt that her gaze had changed a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what she had experienced during the time she disappeared, but her eyes were clearly no longer filled with kindness. Instead, they were filled with malice and cruelty, just like those gangsters from earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, we could manage on our own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I answered faintly, and at the same time, I quickly closed the trunk door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, realizing the danger, I instinctively wanted to immediately return to the carriage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, how could Jade easily let me go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jane and I wanted to return to the car, she immediately made a gesture, and soon a group of people quickly gathered around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Jade said gloomily, "What? We haven't seen each other for so long. Are you not happy to see me again? However, Madeline, I am very happy to see you, and even happier to see that you are pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was approaching me while speaking, her tone was very intimate, but when I saw her strange smile, I felt very scared!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="742.html">« Prev</a><a href="744.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
