They rushed over and surrounded us, intending to rob us directly! Where are you guys? I am currently in the car, but my companion is outside alone, and I am very worried about her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing me say this, Dehan said to me anxiously, "My people are nearby! But Quinn is still being controlled by them. If we show up now, and they kill Quinn, all our efforts will be in vain! Calm down, let me think of a solution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn and Jane must not be in trouble! Mr. Rethe, please, you must find a way! Please! I'm really begging you!" I shouted at him, feeling helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, those few individuals had already shown a fierce expression, wanting to rush over and snatch the suitcases from Jane's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Jane's precautions, she pulled out a sharp knife from her pants leg, but those people were accustomed to fighting and killing, they were not afraid of her at all. </span><span>Seeing Jane with a weapon, they immediately took out sticks and knives, surrounding her like vicious wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you release him, all this money will be yours! Why do you have to rob the money right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane shouted at them while she was dealing with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those few people, the person leading the group was dressed in a flashy shirt and dark red pants, with tattoos visible on both their arms and chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wiped his nose fiercely and said viciously, "Nonsense, you guys are so cunning, of course we have to count the amount first. What if it's not cash in the box? Old woman, I advise you to put down the knife. Since you have already come to this place, it's better for you to cooperate with us, otherwise, we won't be merciful to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we came here with money, of course we will give you the money! As long as you release him, all this money will be yours! But if you don't abide by the agreement and try to rob us, I will fight you to the end!" Jane shouted at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that this woman, who usually appears calm and quiet, would be so fearless at this moment. This ma</span><span>de</span><span> me even more worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I was pregnant and not only was I physically limited, but I also had never learned any self-defense techniques, so I couldn't help Jane at all in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was sweating profusely with anxiety, but I heard the man sneer, "Do you really think you can fight us to the end with your weak and skinny body? I must say, you're quite bold for a woman! Although you look a bit older, your figure is really good. We haven't seen a woman in a long time, so if you don't know what's good for you and step aside, don't be afraid of what we might do to you later, hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this lawless land, they were all villains indeed. These people all had fierce eyes and didn't seem like good people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just finished speaking when they all rushed toward Jane, each holding a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was indeed trained and appeared to have some self-defense skills, but she was still a woman and simply couldn't beat those few people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those men mercilessly struck her back with the sticks in their hands, and their knives cut into her body, one by one. They gradually surrounded her, and finally, the leader, a man with tattoos on his body, grabbed Jane's neck and forcefully pressed her against the body of our car!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scoundrel, how dare you hold a knife against us. It seems we must teach you a lesson! You few, go get the suitcases, I will indulge in this woman first, and then one by one, the rest of you can have your turn. We want her to truly experience the joy of this trip to Norch City!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="739.html">« Prev</a><a href="741.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
