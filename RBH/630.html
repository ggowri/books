What are you doing here?" I exclaimed, then immediately walked up to him and punched him in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I immediately greeted Benjamin, Grey's husband, with a friendly smile and exchanged greetings with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn rarely dresses casually, and he was also wearing a hat, so when I just saw his back, I only felt familiar but didn't associate it with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I hit Quinn, he took the opportunity to grab my hand. He smiled and said, "Yeah, I rarely have time today. Uncle Benjamin asked me to accompany him here for a chat, so I came. I didn't expect you to be here too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was me who called Madeline to come. Otherwise, it would be such a pity for you to be here alone, enjoying this beautiful weather and scenery while we are all lovey-dovey," Grey laughed cheerfully. Then, she lowered her head and intentionally glanced at Quinn holding my hand, with a very ambiguous smile on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly realized that my hand was being held by Quinn, so I quickly pretended to fix my hair and freed my hand from his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You stood for so long, you must be tired. Sit down quickly. The grapes on this table are grown indoors and very sweet. Try them and eat more grapes, it's good for the baby," Quinn looked at me, saying affectionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are the grapes ripe already in this season? So fast!" I asked, somewhat surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The grapes grown indoors are not affected by the seasons. These strawberries are also good. Here, try one," Quinn said, picking out a strawberry shaped like a heart from the exquisite fruit platter on the table and offering it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was well aware of the relationship between Quinn and me, but I wasn't quite used to displaying affection in public like this. However, Quinn seemed to understand my thoughts and winked at me, indicating that I should play along with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I opened my mouth and took a bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, strawberries were just as he had said. It was sweet, juicy, and kind of milky. In short, they were delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For so many years, Quinn has never been so nice to a girl in front of us. Madeline, </span><span>you are really lucky!" Grey looked satisfied at this scene and said to me with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not the first time I had heard such words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similar words have been mentioned to me before by Quinn's parents and his sister, Carole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the Woods family was so accepting of me. After all, their expectations for Quinn in terms of relationships were probably just hoping that he could fall in love with a girl who loved him too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, really? That's truly my honor!" I didn't know how to respond at that moment, so I could only smile and say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't say that. Knowing you is the best thing that ever happened to me. Here, try the grape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn touched my nose and then picked a grape, peeled it carefully, and brought it to my mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey looked at us, the loving couple, and then walked over to Benjamin, placing a hand on his shoulder. Then, pretending to be displeased, she coquettishly said, "Look at these young people and look at you. When was the last time that you treated me similarly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You also said, they are young people, we have been married for many years. Why are you comparing us with them? When we were young, you clung to me like a koala," Benjamin said with a smile. He looked very kind and friendly, and his expression was indulgent, like a man who dotes on his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey blushed like a shy little girl when she heard that. She leaned on Benjamin and then said, "Yeah, if you weren't so sweet, I wouldn't have married you. Benjamin, didn't you ask me how Glory Group was considering? Today, I called Madeline over, you two can talk about business first, and Quinn and I will go grill some meat for you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="629.html">« Prev</a><a href="631.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
