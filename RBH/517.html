If he was infected with this virus, antibiotics wouldn't work. I have some medicine here. Wait, let me call my colleague to bring it over!" I quickly intervened with the doctor and immediately stepped out to call Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, where are you, Leonel, and Hardy right now?" I asked in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're on the ground floor helping volunteers manage the crowd. What's up, Madeline?" Adam inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and bring a box of anti-flu capsules upstairs. Quinn has a high fever and needs to be brought down as soon as possible," I hurriedly instructed Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my urgency, Adam swiftly arrived at the ward with a medicine box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the doctor remained entrenched in his thoughts, convinced that cases like Quinn's wouldn't respond to anything but intravenous antibiotics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't have time to explain further to the doctor. I just had Adam fetch water, helped Quinn sit up, and administered two pills to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, this medicine works wonders against this virus. Several people around me have seen remarkable results with it. It's much more effective than antibiotics. Trust me, you'll see I'm right soon," I told the doctor after Quinn took the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's my patient and must strictly follow my medical instructions. Otherwise, our hospital won't be held accountable if anything goes wrong. I need to make this clear to you first. I didn't recognize the medicine you insisted on giving him, but I've recorded everything, so you're responsible for any consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was the doctor skeptical of my claims, but he videotaped everything that had just happened and recorded our conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his distrust, I understood him. After all, he was just doing his job responsibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I allowed him to record and assured him I would take responsibility for any consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor left the ward somewhat indignantly. At this time, Quinn was still in deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's the situation?" I quickly asked Adam after the doctor left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's grim.&nbsp;The first batch of patients were treated with antibiotics, but it didn't pan out well. Since yesterday, we've had over ten severe cases, with a death toll of over five. However, the hospital is keeping it hush to dodge blame.&nbsp;I pitched our medicine to the docs last night, but they brushed it off, citing it as new, and weren't keen to hear us out," Adam explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The issue Adam mentioned wasn't unique to this hospital. It was prevalent elsewhere, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. Is there any news about Carthage?" I inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only spreading on social media for now. Official reports are limited to major cities. Actually, the situation in Carthage is much worse than Hoswich, but everyone's attention is elsewhere. And, Madeline, I have some bad news to share. Carthage is now under complete lockdown. We might not be able to go back to Hoswich anytime soon," Adam whispered to me, his words sending a chill down my spine.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="516.html">« Prev</a><a href="518.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
