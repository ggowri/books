Laura stood with her hands on her hips and confidently said, "Hmph, do you think I didn't want to have more children back then? It's all because your father. When he was young, didn't value his precious sperm and wasted it on other women, which resulted in me having only you as an only child! If you dare to follow in his footsteps, believe me, I will beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so shocked that my mouth dropped open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Elliott heard Laura say such words, he was both angry and annoyed for a moment, but he didn't know how to deal with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Outrageous! What are you talking about?" Jasper exclaimed, his face turning red with anger. He turned around, crossed his arms, and walked out. Clearly, being publicly exposed, he had no face to stay in the ward any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should go back, Mom, really, don't cause any more trouble." Elliott was probably afraid that his mother would cause more trouble if she stayed in the ward, so he pushed and persuaded her out of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About ten minutes later, Elliott walked back into the ward, feeling a sense of exhaustion permeating his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed the door with a serious look, as if afraid of being disturbed again. At the same time, he probably noticed that I had been watching him, so he pretended to casually explain, "Don't listen to my mom's nonsense. She's overly suspicious. My dad used to be too busy and frequently went on business trips. There was never any woman like she claims."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence, both seemed to absolve Jasper and also seemed to absolve himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Laura was implying one thing both explicitly and implicitly: like father, like son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled to hold back my laughter and couldn't help but say, "It seems that some things are hereditary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked up and gave me a glare: "I said, my mom was talking nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine, whether you're talking nonsense or not, I don't care. After all, it's all true and false, who knows what's really going on with you men outside," I said, spreading my hands indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Elliott's affairs outside would make my nerves on the verge of being strained, every single one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since getting married over two years ago, if I remember correctly, he has been rumored to be involved with around ten women, and Sylvia was just one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to constantly pester him, chasing after him and wanting an explanation from him. But back then, he couldn't be bothered to even acknowledge me and always told me to mind my own business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now I don't care as much, but I didn't expect him to suddenly say, "I have never had any substantial relationship with other women, so you don't have to take those rumors seriously. In the future, I will be mindful of boundaries when interacting with the opposite sex."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to be explaining the past, as well as promising the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I immediately shook my head and said, "You don't have to change yourself for me, you can do whatever you want. Although we are married, our souls are free. I was wrong to be so concerned in the past, and I won't ask inappropriate questions anymore in the future."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="166.html">« Prev</a><a href="168.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
