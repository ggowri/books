Elliott mentioned you're busy now, so why don't both of you go attend to your own matters? Giselle can keep me company here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac suggested, his eyes reflecting a fondness for Giselle that he had never shown towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, I tentatively asked Cormac, "Grandpa, it seems like you and Giselle get along well."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get bored in the countryside, and Giselle often takes time out to keep me company. She's thoughtful and filial, unlike Elliott, who used to spend time with me as a child but seems to have forgotten me as he grew up," Cormac complained. He was smiling, not blaming Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been busy these past few years, it wasn't intentional neglect towards you, just..." Elliott tried to explain, feeling helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand, a man must prioritize his career. I don't blame you. Giselle is like my own granddaughter, always bringing me treats," Cormac said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he looked at Giselle affectionately, surprising me with the depth of his feelings.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "For me, Cormac's strong affection for Giselle is not good news.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Cormac's influence and authority within the Bryant family are undeniable. Even Elliott has mentioned wanting to have a child with me for Cormac's sake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Cormac were to think that Giselle is right for Elliott, it would be terrible. However, no matter what, I will never allow Giselle to easily take away everything from me and win the love of everyone in the Bryant family like in the previous life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, go about your business. I've taken a week off from the company to spend time with Mr. Cormac Bryant. You can't fire me for that," Giselle said to Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her coy demeanor was proof that she didn't take me seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, don't worry, I won't fire you," Elliott replied calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then stood up and glanced at me before speaking, "Madeline, leave Giselle here with Grandpa. Let's head back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Cormac's request for Giselle to stay and Giselle taking a week off for him, I knew that staying wouldn't win Cormac's favor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had already succeeded in pleasing Cormac. I had to come up with other plans.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding, I bid farewell to Cormac, then turned and left the ward with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we exited, I walked ahead, ignoring him completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt ashamed about the check-up and irritated by Elliott's defense of Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Elliott caught up and gently held my arm, asking, "Madeline, where are you going?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Grandpa is fine, I plan to head back to Louis City. I've already delayed a lot of work these past few days," I replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing my anger, Elliott suggested. "It's almost noon, you must be hungry. There's a classic restaurant nearby, how about I take you there for a meal?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at my phone, I realized it was almost noon, and I hadn't eaten much for breakfast, feeling a pang of hunger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Elliott's gentle gaze, I sensed a mix of reconciliation and appeasement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deciding not to dwell on the issue further, I relented.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and agreed to join him for lunch.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="241.html">« Prev</a><a href="243.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
