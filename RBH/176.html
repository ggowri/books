What did I think?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How does Elliott know what I'm thinking and what am I thinking?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was forced to be tightly embraced by him, however, the thought of his arms just holding Giselle not long ago, and holding her for so long, made me feel disgusted, indescribably disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled with all my strength, pushing desperately, but Elliott just wouldn't let go of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't let go unless you tell me that you didn't misunderstand me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone remained dominant, and it sounded like he was also afraid that I might have misunderstood the scene just now. However, in fact, I had already misunderstood, not just misunderstood, but also quite bothered by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't misunderstand anything, haven't you always been like this? I got used to it a long time ago, Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I wouldn't be so foolish as to tell Elliott all my inner thoughts, there's no need, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more I show that I care, the more Elliott will feel that I care about him. Therefore, even if I pretend, I must try my best to pretend very casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed surprised by my calmness. He let go of me and lifted my chin, staring into my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You didn't misunderstand just now? Giselle had too much to drink and showed signs of alcohol poisoning. I just took her to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott explained again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked into his eyes, but in reality, my heart was bleeding. However, I had a smile on my face, a smile that appeared particularly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see. I was just wondering why you were carrying her to the hospital. It seems like you were drinking with her last night, so you came late, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to be very relaxed, as if I didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was starting to admire myself a little for my increasingly proficient acting skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't drink with her," it seemed like she couldn't sense my concern. The caution in Elliott's eyes gradually faded away, and he said, "How did you come downstairs? The doctor said you still need rest and shouldn't get out of bed for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was feeling bored lying down, so I decided to take a walk. Unexpectedly, I happened to witness you being a hero and saving Giselle. To be honest, Elliott, you seem to genuinely care about Giselle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still pretended to be relaxed, with a smile on my face as I said these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I knew, I was stubborn, my heart was still hurting, I didn't look into Elliott's eyes, I just didn't want him to see any clues through my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lied again. Come on, I'll take you back to the ward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to dislike hearing me say that he cared about Giselle, but he never offered any explanation for my statement, and this reaction was as if he tacitly agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I'll go up by myself. Giselle is still in the emergency room. You stay here and wait, just in case there's any sudden situation and the doctor can't find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head and said in a pretended manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also didn't know why I behaved so strangely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I jumped off the sickbed and went to find Elliott, I was extremely angry and resentful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, when I actually saw Elliott, I was able to remain so calm, so calm that even I myself was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like I was splitting apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was one me who was extremely concerned about everything regarding Elliott and Giselle, while another me was completely uninterested in anything about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott may have noticed that I really didn't care, and Giselle was indeed trying to salvage the situation, so he said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then when she finishes the rescue, I will come up immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that, between me and Giselle, he subconsciously prioritizes Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if to confirm it once again, my heart was stung by Elliott's words, but on my face, I smiled exceptionally brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, take good care of her. Alcohol poisoning is not a trivial matter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished saying this sentence, I didn't stay any longer and went straight towards the direction of the ward.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="175.html">« Prev</a><a href="177.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
