Giselle paused for a moment, then muttered to herself. Suddenly, as if realizing something, Giselle snorted coldly, "I don't care. He was already seriously ill. He was bound to die sooner or later, no wonder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Giselle, who used to disguise herself, had been exposed, she clearly didn't want to continue pretending. She actually said such cruel words in front of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her cold attitude, I couldn't help but recall how obedient, filial, kind, and sensible she used to be in front of Cormac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Giselle was only pretending in order to achieve her goals. It was only at this moment that she revealed her true self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, didn't you respect Cormac a lot before? Now that the truth has been revealed, you don't want to continue pretending anymore?" Fiona couldn't help but mock. She was a very honest person and looked down upon people like Giselle who were good at pretending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle glanced at the four of us, and then, a very eerie smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This smile reminded me of my last life. When I was thrown into the icy sea by a few strong men on the deck of a yacht, Giselle also had the same sinister and malicious </span><span>smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I thought about how she hurt me and replaced me in the previous life, and then saw her current desperate look like a bereaved dog, the hatred in my heart finally found its release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The truth has been revealed?" Giselle's expression was filled with intense resentment. She scanned all of us in the room. "Don't think I don't know who did it. Madeline, besides you, no one else would sabotage my good plan like this! It was you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle suddenly cast a hateful gaze towards me. Her eyes were malicious, and that once beautiful face now appeared grotesque.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have the courage to do such a thing. Aren't you afraid of being discovered one day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was worried that she might have had listening devices or something like that on her, so instead of directly saying it, I asked Giselle to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She snorted and said, "As long as I become Elliott's wife, everything will be decided by me! So what if I am found out? In this world, the power of speech is in the hands of the winners. Tonight, I was supposed to have won, but unexpectedly, you ruined everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Giselle finished speaking, she suddenly pointed at me. Her expression was malicious, giving me a strong sense of discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was you who ruined my happiness, Giselle, please understand that. As for your own life, you destroyed it with your own hands. You had the opportunity to graduate from a prestigious school, work diligently, and then marry a good man. Isn't that good enough? I don't understand why you had to entangle yourself with Elliott! , Don't you feel ashamed of being a mistress and destroying someone else's family?" I said, looking at Giselle, who showed no signs of remorse.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="655.html">« Prev</a><a href="657.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
