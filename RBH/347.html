He reached over and grabbed my chin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I naturally understood what his "punishment" meant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously looked around. Come on, this was the main street with lots of people and traffic!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, my mother is still waiting for us at home!" I urged hastily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you have aroused my desire. So you have to solve it on the spot. Or do you want me to molest you in front of your mother?" There were so many different ways for Elliott to talk about this kind of thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave him a hard look and said, "Can you be more serious?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriousness is for outsiders. If I am serious to my wife, I may not be a man." Elliott was overbearing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished his words, he pushed me down on the seat, leaned over, and kissed me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roadside was bustling with people, and it was the rush hour for people to get off work.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't care about this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a great kisser, kissing and biting me. A feeling of electric shock and numbness soon spread throughout my body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gasped at his kiss. My cheeks started to get red. My eyes also became moist unconsciously. I was unconsciously soft as a ball of cotton.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After kissing and biting me for a while, he hooked my chin and said in a hoarse voice, "If it were dark enough, I would have to sleep with you right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My face instantly turned red and my heart was beating fast in my chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did I realize that he actually had such a strong desire. Surprisingly, his desire could be aroused no matter when and where.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bad man!" I couldn't help but curse him bitterly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought of his serious and arrogant look in the past. But he was completely different at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I scolded him like this, he leaned over to grab my lips and kissed me for a while. Then he drove away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh my God!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My face turned red and I looked out the window with a guilty conscience. I didn't dare to offend him anymore. I couldn't help but recall the scene at the beach in my mind and even missed that day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Paige always said that the happiness of sex between men and women was indescribable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I only knew little about sex and never had the opportunity to practice it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I finally knew that the joy of this was really unimaginable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but sneak Elliott. At this time, he was turning the steering wheel with one hand and looking ahead seriously. His strong masculine look made me fascinated at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so obsessed with me. He must have fallen in love with me, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously asked myself. However, I didn't have a definite answer in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly found that he never said the word "love".</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So our close bond came for love or something else?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="346.html">« Prev</a><a href="348.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
