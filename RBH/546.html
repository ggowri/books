Whenever classmates felt under the weather or caught a cold, they would take his pills, and it would work like magic." I didn't catch my mom's underlying meaning, just continued following her lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did I know, Lily suddenly gave a mysterious smile, then whispered, "Your father and I were thinking, if you and Marcus... it wouldn't be a bad idea. Madeline, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's sudden change in topic made me realize what she was getting at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback, looking at her with confusion. "Mom, what are you thinking? Marcus and I are just friends. Don't try to set us up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I'm just joking around with your dad." Lily chuckled awkwardly, then sighed, "If you weren't pregnant, it might actually be a possibility. But since you are, we can't deceive anyone, and our family can't do such things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's words left me at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced instinctively at Quinn and Austin in the living room, seeing them deeply engrossed in their game of chess. The thought of Quinn having to talk to them later made my heart suddenly feel conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily quickly whipped up a meal, and soon we were all gathered around the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered that Marcus usually ate alone, so before dinner, she called him to invite him over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus arrived with a large bag of fruits, and we all sat together. Austin immediately brought out his cherished wine, inviting Marcus and Quinn to join him for a drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere at the dinner table was light and cheerful, everyone happy to hear that the baby was healthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the mood was just right, Quinn gave me a meaningful look, then raised his glass, suddenly turning serious as he addressed my parents. "Austin, Lily, allow me to propose a toast. There's something I'd like to discuss with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing what he was about to say, I tensed up, instinctively setting down my fork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what's the matter, please tell us!" Austin also raised his glass, looking at Quinn with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, considering that Madeline would find it quite exhausting and challenging to raise the child alone, I would like to propose that Madeline and I co-parent this child together. Rest assured, I will treat the child as my own," Quinn spoke sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Austin nearly choked on the sip of wine he had just taken, clearly surprised. His face turned bright red, coughing violently for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, this... this is too sudden! Do you really mean this?" Lily, seeing his reaction, hurriedly patted Austin's back, asking in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Lily instinctively looked at me, seeming to understand something, and then turned her gaze to Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really mean it. Originally, I wanted to go through all the steps from engagement to marriage with Madeline, but Madeline said it was too soon and she wasn't mentally prepared. However, I have already discussed this with my parents, and they are very pleased with Madeline," Quinn confessed truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Lily was even more puzzled. "But the child and you... Quinn, are you really sure your parents will accept this? The Woods family is a prominent family in Hoswich. Have you not told your parents the truth?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="545.html">« Prev</a><a href="547.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
