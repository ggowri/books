And as my gaze followed up from the Adam's apple, it was none other than Elliott's devastatingly handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely lost in a daze when I saw who it was at that moment, wondering if I had entered some kind of dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I am in Louis City, and I am inside the film and television base of Louis City. How could Elliott suddenly appear here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe it. I was just about to raise my hand to rub my eyes, but Elliott grabbed both of my hands and pressed them against my head, preventing me from moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at me with his deep, ocean-like hazel eyes, but I couldn't see through or understand what messages they held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me like this, first staring at my face for a while, and then he lowered his head to take a look at my outfit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his gaze lingered on the scarce fabric on my chest, a hint of anger flashed in his eyes. "In such a gathering of men, with cameras around, you dress like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he spoke, his words were filled with strong reproach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that, after such a long time without contact, without talking, and without any interaction, when I saw him again, he still had the same tone. As soon as he spoke, it seemed like he didn't like anything about me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed, since I couldn't move anyway, so I lazily leaned against the ancient wall and softly said, "How about it? Isn't it very sexy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes instantly sparked with anger. "Madeline, are you deliberately trying to provoke me? Do I need to remind you that you were married?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When did he become so hesitant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He often emphasized my married status... Am I married? Yes, but who treats me like a wife? No one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few young male actors had already raised the appeal of men to me, so when I saw the handsome Elliott again, I felt no ripples in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, the more I saw him so angry, the more I felt a sense of retaliatory pleasure in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him with a sidelong glance, seductively batting my eyelashes. "Oh, long time no see, my darling. You've brought me to this alley all of a sudden, so, are you planning to spoil me here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sighed softly, my eyes wandering in all directions. Coupled with my appearance today, even though I couldn't see what I looked like, I could sense enough through his rapidly changing gaze to perceive the turbulent emotions in his heart at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he ever see me like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And men, for the most part, are creatures who think with their lower body, and even someone as proud as Elliott is no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes conveyed disdain, however, his hand couldn't help but wrap around my slender waist, tightly embedding my delicate figure into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started to breathe slightly faster, but his tone remained as cold and ruthless as ever. "It seems that you've been having a good time these days, not only with a young male actor by your side, but also learning how to seduce men, isn't that right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My waist was tightly bound by him, so tight that my legs had to stretch between his thighs. This posture was extremely ambiguous, especially since I was wearing a low-cut classical gown, and with him doing this, my entire chest was exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The discomfort in my body made me unable to resist, but he was very strong and refused to let go, his eyes glaring at me as if he wanted to devour me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't matter whether I am happy or not, as long as you are happy. Why did you bring me to this alley? What do you want to say?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="142.html">« Prev</a><a href="144.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
