If not, come to the hospital. Grandpa says he needs to talk to us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Grandpa wants to see us?</span><span> </span><span>Didn't I just visit Grandpa with Mom?"</span><span> </span><span>But since Grandpa has never reached out to me before, there must be a reason this time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll come right away," I quickly replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After </span><span>told </span><span>my mom, I drove back to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing open the door to Cormac's room, I was surprised to find Elliott, Giselle, and Nicole inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to my recent slap on Giselle's face, as I entered, the looks from Giselle and Nicole were particularly fierce, especially Nicole.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her usually friendly face now appeared gloomy and almost terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spotting me, Elliott motioned for me to join him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, he informed Cormac, "Grandpa, Madeline is here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I passed by a famous beverage shop just now and brought you an original milk and a chocolate milk. Which flavor do you prefer?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised the cups of milk I had bought from the shop and approached Cormac, smiling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it sweet? I don't like it too sweet," Cormac asked, trying to sit up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott quickly placed a large pillow behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's slightly sweet. I asked them not to put in too much sugar. Would you like to try it?" I replied, opening the lid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure." Cormac nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I placed a tissue under Cormac's chin and fed him the milk slowly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had always been distant with Cormac before, never thinking of doing such things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after learning about Giselle's efforts to please Elliott's family, I decided to change my attitude and get along well with every member of the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I called you and Elliott here today to tell you that you two need to hurry up. I'm getting older, and all I wish for now is to see your children born in my lifetime," Cormac said with a smile after finishing the milk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was prepared for Cormac's urging for us to have kids, so I smiled and replied, "Alright, Grandpa, Elliott and I will do our best."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes effort alone isn't enough. Today, I've arranged for you both to see Doctor Louis, the most authoritative expert in this hospital. You need to have a check-up to see if both of you are fit for having a child. Doctor Louis is hard to book, so you must agree to this request," Cormac said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't expected Cormac's reason for calling us to the hospital to be this, especially in front of Giselle and Nicole.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elderly person asking for such tests undoubtedly implied that he believed we had some health issues due to our long time without children.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling extremely embarrassed, I wanted to disappear at that moment.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="239.html">« Prev</a><a href="241.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
