However, just by intuition, I vaguely felt that this woman seemed to be Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that she came with Laura?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she listening in on my conversation with Laura the whole time?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused and left the coffee shop without moving. However, as I stepped into my car, I didn't drive off immediately but sat in the car and waited quietly for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As luck would have it, it wasn't long before I saw Giselle holding Laura's hand and the two of them exiting the coffee shop angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene was like a repeat of the previous life. My heart felt as if a needle had been passed through it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was clearly determined to make Giselle my replacement. She could not wait for me to step aside...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched their backs fade out of my sight before I resumed driving back to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was still in the ICU and didn't need a family member to stay with him, but Lily insisted on staying at the hospital. She did not want to leave and would rather sit in the corridor, just wanting to be closer to Austin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to sit in the corridor with Lily. It was the middle of the night, the wind was blowing pretty cold in the corridor, and Lily was obviously getting a little stretched out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'll take you back to rest first. Let me keep watch here," Seeing her exhausted look, I said with instant concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm going to stay here. In case your dad wakes up in the middle of the night, he will definitely want to see me first. After so many years, your dad and I haven't slept apart. Madeline, think about how much pain your dad must have felt the moment he was hit!" Lily couldn't hold back her tears again as she spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was usually an extraordinarily image-conscious woman, but because of this car accident with Austin, she had become very haggard in one day. It was as if she had aged ten years at once.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, dad isn't going to wake up that soon. I know you're worried about him, but right now we both need to save our strength and protect ourselves so we can take care of my dad. You listen to my advice and go back to rest obediently. If you can't, you can sleep in Fiona's office," I advised again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having experienced the life-and-death separation from my parents in my last life, I thought this life was extraordinarily precious to me. Austin had already had such an accident, so I did not want Lily to experience any further conditions in the slightest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily still refused to do so. But I was adamant and eventually let her go to rest on the cot in Fiona's office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staying with Lily as she fell asleep, I reentered outside Austin's ICU. Through the glass of the ICU, I looked inside at Austin, who was covered in tubes, and I agonized inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just then, Quinn called me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you? Are you still at the hospital?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes Quinn. Did you check the surveillance I asked you to check?" I asked in a rush.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing at the hospital this late? You hurry to go and rest. I had a friend check the surveillance. It was a bit dark at that time, and only your dad and the truck were there at that time. The truck suddenly changed lanes while your dad was driving, causing him to crash into the truck. Also, I found one more suspicious thing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn paused as she spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I checked out a piece of surveillance on another roadway. I found that truck waiting at the last intersection about a half hour before your dad showed up. The driver of the truck was just as your dad was about to drive to that fork in the road when he started the car and continued on his way. That doesn't seem like a coincidence. Madeline, are you concerned that the crash was deliberately planned when you asked me to check the surveillance?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was sharp and quickly guessed my intentions.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="301.html">« Prev</a><a href="303.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
