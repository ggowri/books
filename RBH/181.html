My heart was filled with shock for a moment, and I didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, this is what I should have done. I told Madeline, otherwise she would have thought I was taking credit for it." Elliott said very naturally, with an extremely affable smile on his glacier-like face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not wear a suit today, but a warm white sweater with a pair of smoke-gray trousers, and a pair of white sneakers underneath. The whole person did not seem as oppressive as usual, on the contrary, he had a kind of neighbor boy-like Adam and friendliness, and he looked much younger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trees in my yard were lush, and the flowers around the pavilion were blooming in clusters. Elliott stood up and walked towards me with one hand in his pocket, smiling. With the lush background behind him, he looked like a man from a painting, exuding a sense of ethereal charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a bit stunned, my mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, his appearance today is exactly what I had fantasized countless times in the past, and the clothes he is wearing are the ones I bought for him two years ago when we just got married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my daze, he had already walked up to me. In front of my parents, he casually placed his hand on my shoulder, and then affectionately pinched my cheek. "Have you been so busy these days? You didn't even answer my calls, making me worried."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's like he knew I was avoiding him, but he didn't expose me and still didn't tell my parents about my injury. He just silently expressed his dissatisfaction in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I, in front of my parents, naturally couldn't say much. I could only say lightly, "It's nothing, aren't you busy with work? Don't let me and my parents delay your important matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Accompanying your parents is the priority, work can be put aside no matter how busy it is. I didn't do well in this aspect before, but in the future, I will make up for it more." He said in a deep voice, every word and sentence seemed to carry a profound meaning, but I dared not speculate further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He is so leisurely, it seems that Giselle is already fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was silently complaining in my heart, but I didn't show it on my face. As they say, a mother knows her daughter best, and Lily clearly noticed my unusual behavior. So, she quickly said, "Elliott, why don't you continue playing chess with Austin? Madeline and I will go and cook for you. It's rare for you to come home today, so I'll make a good lunch for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Lily," Elliott nodded in response. Once upon a time, he saw my parents without even exchanging pleasantries. But now, hearing him affectionately call out Lily's name made me feel a mix of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily and I walked into the kitchen together, and only then did Lily ask me, "Madeline, why do I feel like something is off between you and Elliott? He seems enthusiastic towards you now, but it seems like you are distant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily lived up to her reputation. In just a few sentences of conversation, she managed to figure out the clues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, no, it's just that maybe it's been a long time. You always say that a plain and simple life is true." I quickly brushed it off, as I didn't want to worry Lily too much about our situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to me, Lily didn't say much. She took out ingredients from the refrigerator and started preparing the food while saying, "Well, that's true. Life is always plain, but seeing you all like this, my worried heart finally let go. Elliott used to rarely come to our house, but these days he comes every day and makes Austin extremely happy. He knows Austin loves brandy, so he brought several bottles for him. Austin is very satisfied with him now, Madeline. If you two put in more effort and give us a little grandchild, everything will be even more perfect..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never dreamed that just as I was recovering, Lily would join the army of those urging me to have a child.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="180.html">« Prev</a><a href="182.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
