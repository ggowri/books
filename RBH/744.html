At that moment, I swiftly jumped into the car and immediately grabbed Jane's collar, trying to pull her into the car as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Jade would never let us escape so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rushed up and grabbed Jane's arm, pulling desperately downwards. At the same time, the few people following her also approached, trying to drag me off the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, close the door! Hurry! Don't mind me! Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Jane shouted in a hurry, but at this moment, Jade directly grabbed her hair and pulled Jane to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was just about to close the door when, at that moment, Jade directly stepped on Jane's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her wearing black high-top boots, cruelly stomping on Jane's face, my heart instantly clenched with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How innocent Jane was! She just found a regular job and went on a company outing. Because of me, she suffered so much, and now she has to endure this kind of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was still possible to close the door at this moment, but if I closed it, Jane would be tormented by them. If that happened, I would never be able to forgive myself for the rest of my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's goal was me, she wanted money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, I got out of the car directly and shouted loudly at Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jade! Stop! Your target is me! Don't harm my companion, she is innocent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my words, Jade's feet finally moved away from Jane's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head and stared at me with a sinister gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you were pregnant now, and Glory Group was also booming. I really underestimated you before. You acted so innocent in front of me! I didn't expect you </span><span>to be so capable." Her tone was cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held her hands together and looked me up and down, then suddenly made a gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could react, her two subordinates immediately rushed over and grabbed both of my arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked around coldly and found that the surroundings were all desolate hills. There was not a single sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have already informed Dehan that the hostages they have in their hands are not Quinn. Why haven't they come to rescue us yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was terrible, both Jane and I were being controlled by them. I was very anxious, but I pretended to be calm. I didn't want them to see my true thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't bring up the past anymore. You were so greedy back then, I didn't realize my father's kindness toward you, and you even wanted to take control of Glory Group. I wouldn't have hurt you. It's all your own fault. Let's get to the point! Why did you deceive me into coming here today? Do you want money, or something else? Release my companion first, what do you want? We can talk it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade looked at me, took another look up and down, and then sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were doing well, managing a company for two years, and now you have become brave as well. It seems that Quinn is important to you, as you not only came to the border for him but also willing to give out 10 million dollars in cash. You are also pregnant. If I were to call Quinn and Elliott separately and tell them that you are in my hands, how much money do you think they would be willing to offer to save you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="743.html">« Prev</a><a href="745.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
