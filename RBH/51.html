I had no good impression of this woman who was trying to seize opportunities to climb up the social ladder. I directly instructed the security guard to kick her out of the hotel's entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for how she would complain to Elliott, I couldn't be bothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I knew that this woman was just a fleeting character in Elliott's life. She was not worth mentioning at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is at least the most important dinner of the Bryant Group. Please don't tell me you plan to attend dressed like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Sylvia was driven away, Quinn looked me up and down and asked me with a half-smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave him a disdainful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, how could I really embarrass myself like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn burst into laughter immediately and said, "I knew it! But if you had been wearing a formal dress while punishing those scoundrels just now, it would have been even more authoritative."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered, "Do we really need to dress up to deal with such a bitch? Even if I wear flip-flops, I can still beat her up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was directly amused by my boldness, but at that moment, Giselle suddenly walked towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed a bit reserved and somewhat embarrassed. She cautiously asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I wanted to ask, are you the lady who was in my flower shop that day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I even wore sunglasses that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect she had such a good memory. She actually remembered me and now she even came over to greet me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was quite surprised and nodded slightly. "Yes, it was me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really you," she laughed suddenly, her smile particularly radiant and infectious. "I never would have guessed that you are Mrs. Bryant. I... I'm Giselle Cole, an intern in the Planning Department of the Bryant Group. Mrs. Bryant, if you ever need flowers in the future, you can always come to me, and I'll deliver them to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was indeed a very affable girl, with a sweet smile and a clear, natural voice. What's rare was that she was also poised and graceful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed difficult not to have a good impression of such a girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for her taking the ill-intentioned initiative to approach me in my previous life, maybe I would have actually become friends with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, give me your business card."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her, maintaining a friendly yet distant smile on my face. At that moment, Quinn, on the other hand, gave me a strange look, as if lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Mrs. Bryant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle immediately took out a white business card from her pocket and handed it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the business card, there was her position, phone number, email, and WhatsApp number, and out of curiosity, I added her on WhatsApp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was getting late, and it was time for me to change into a new dress and dress myself up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned and walked towards the direction of the VIP changing room, and Quinn, for some reason, followed along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you didn't need to add a newly arrived intern of the Bryant Group on WhatsApp."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing to add her as a friend. She's a pure and beautiful girl. Maybe Mr. Bryant likes this kind of girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively said and turned around to enter the changing room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why did you feel this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn also followed in. He suddenly turned my body and, supporting my shoulders, asked very seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why he suddenly became so serious, and his eyes were also full of inquiry, which made me very confused. I pushed his hand away and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Woods, what's wrong with you? You know Elliott well enough. He appreciates all types of women, even someone like Sylvia. Who knows, maybe one day he'll want an innocent young girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words left Quinn somewhat lost, as if this answer was not what he had wanted. He smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, Elliott wasn't as promiscuous as you said. He was just playing around with them, nothing serious."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="50.html">« Prev</a><a href="52.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
