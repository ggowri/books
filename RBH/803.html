They both stared each other down fiercely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat there, a smirk playing on his face, as if he still held the upper hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rose to his feet, casually draping an arm around my shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I'll take you back to the office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was watching us from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly felt a stiffness in my body. However, thinking of his illness, I couldn't resist too obviously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I had no choice but to pretend I had an itch. As I scratched, I subtly moved a bit further away from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us exited the restaurant together, then rode the elevator down to the first floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a tall figure caught my eye, striding towards me. She was clad in a black trench coat, radiating an intense aura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's Carole.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused, my gaze meeting hers. Without missing a beat, I exclaimed:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carole!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, it's you guys. Just finished eating, huh? What a coincidence. I've heard good things about the newly opened SkyPark restaurant. I was thinking of taking my mom there to try it out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn stepped forward without hesitation. She was about to smile, but then, she caught sight of Elliott. In an instant, her smile faded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Elliott a meaningful glance. Then, she turned to her younger brother, her face etched with confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She must be puzzled. How come I'm still hanging out with Elliott and Quinn, even after all these years since Elliott and I divorced?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sis, I was grabbing a bite with Madeline and we bumped into Elliott. Didn't you say you were bringing Mom along? Where is she?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn caught the confusion in his sister's eyes. He stepped forward, explaining calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, Madeline, what brings you two here? Have you eaten yet? If not, let's grab a bite together, come on&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had Quinn finished speaking than his mom walked in through the front door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me standing with Quinn, her tone was warm. She came forward and affectionately wrapped her arm around mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even notice Elliott, her eyes were all on me, her face filled with a warm, loving smile. She said to me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've been wanting to visit you these past few weeks, but Quinn kept stopping me. He said you needed rest and we shouldn't disturb you. Just like that, a month has passed. How are you feeling now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Quinn's mom laid eyes on me, there was an immediate sense of warmth and familiarity. Her care and concern kindled a comforting warmth within me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, realizing that Elliott was standing right there, I hastily cut her off:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie, I'm doing well, thank you for your concern. You and Carole go ahead and start dinner, we've already eaten. The food upstairs is indeed quite good."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, anyone up for seconds?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's mom didn't sense anything amiss. She asked me again, her smile unwavering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a cough echoed from behind me. It was Elliott. He stepped forward, deliberately taking my hand in front of Quinn's mom and Carole. His eyes narrowed slightly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, Madeline just had a full meal. Auntie, thank you and Carole for your care towards Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath Elliott's calm facade, it seemed as if a potent resentment was simmering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left both Carole and her mother utterly astounded. As they looked at our intertwined hands, shock was written all over the faces of Quinn's mother and Carole...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="802.html">« Prev</a><a href="804.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
