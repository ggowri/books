She held her belly and pretended to be in pain again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, can you let me go first? My lower abdomen hurts so much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pretended to be pitiful again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura just said that this child was not Elliott's, but when she heard that Giselle had a stomachache, she rushed over immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately pushed me aside and asked Giselle with concern, "Giselle, are you okay? Does your lower abdomen hurt? Come on, I will take you to the hospital now. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being pushed by Laura, I lost my balance and fell backward. Just as I was about to fall, I was supported by a strong arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I fell into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised and found that the person was Quinn when I looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing a black woolen suit and looked very elegant. While he supported me, he looked at Laura coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Laura Bryant, even if you love the child in Giselle's belly, you can't push Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Quinn showed up, he defended me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words suddenly caused an uproar again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Quinn, Giselle instantly looked excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if she had finally found a way to defeat me, she pointed at Quinn and said excitedly, "Madeline, stop acting! You and this toyboy have been together for a long time, and your marriage to Elliot has already ended! You have known for a long time that the child in my belly is Elliott's, so there is no need for you to act in public."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle neglected the image of the Bryant family and exposed the truth to everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was equal to her admitting in public that she was Elliott's mistress and got pregnant with Elliott's kid before I officially divorced Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Giselle's words, everyone present was shocked and started to discuss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god, she just said the baby in her belly is Elliott's. Did I hear that correctly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's absolutely true. No wonder Mrs. Laura Bryant introduced her to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, Ms. Mayers is so pitiful! Bryant Group received so much help from Glory Group back then, but now Bryant Group is ungrateful after it is developed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryant Group has always had a good reputation in Hoswich for so many years, and Mr. Bryant seems to be an upright person. I didn't expect that he would do such an immoral thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, isn't this mistress too arrogant? Which family does she come from? I believe she does not come from a wealthy family because no family with a prominent background will let their child get pregnant before getting married or ruin another's marriage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They talked mainly about Laura and Giselle, which made Laura look grim. It must have been a night of humiliation for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing these comments, I cried. This time, I was not acting but showing my true feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought of the scene in my previous life when the Bryant family and Giselle controlled public opinion and tried their best to slander me to force me to divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, I was just like Laura and Giselle were now, being spurned by everyone. Even now, I couldn't forget that feeling of humiliation.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="455.html">« Prev</a><a href="457.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
