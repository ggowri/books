I could hear Elliott calling my name over and over. Then, he soaked a soft cloth in water and tirelessly wiped my face with it, his hand soothingly stroking my back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How on earth did you get yourself this drunk? Thank goodness I showed up today. What if some guy had taken advantage of you? What would we have done then?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The droplets on my face jolted me into a moment of clarity. I could hear Elliott's voice echoing from above my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were just ordinary words, but at that moment, his voice and actions seemed to hold a powerful enchantment for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body tingled as if electrified, a peculiar itch spreading all over. A primal urge compelled me to reach out and scratch his chest. I yanked open his collar, like a ravenous infant, desperately seeking something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reckon, at this moment, I must be wildly unrestrained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was utterly out of my own control. Yet, the last shred of sanity lingering in my mind compelled me to murmur:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't... don't touch me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you actually want me to touch you, or not?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott cradled my face in his hands. Seeing my distress, he couldn't help but furrow his brows, asking softly. Then, I heard his gentle sigh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car kept rolling on. I had no clue where Elliott was taking me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With pleading eyes, I looked at him, hoping he wouldn't really do anything to me. Yet, I couldn't help but let my hands wander over his body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What man could resist a woman's advances like this?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could clearly hear Elliott's breathing becoming heavier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the confines of the room, the incessant ringing of my phone echoed. Yet, Elliott merely glanced at it before nonchalantly tossing it aside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no clue who was on the other end of the line, only that the phone had been ringing off the hook for what felt like an eternity. Then, Elliott snatched up my phone and barked into the receiver:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it, she's with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, the phone never rang again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The itch inside me was growing stronger, so intense that I could barely keep it under control. I felt like I was suffocating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I willingly perched myself on Elliott's lap, my hands looped around his neck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but extend my tongue, greedily lapping at his lips. I wrapped around his body like a flame.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since parting ways with Elliott, and throughout my pregnancy, I've never had such an intimate encounter with a man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the influence of the drug and my own physiological instincts, I could feel my body turning soft, as if melting into a puddle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's breathing grew heavier. He cradled the back of my head, struggling to pry my lips away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face morphed into many others before my eyes. Yet, his pair of eyes remained exceptionally profound and clear in my sight:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, behave yourself, will you? We're almost home,"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mumbled a response. Yet, I couldn't resist the urge to kiss him, leaning in close to his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I know you're hurting. But I won't touch you now, because it's not what you truly want."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned his head, making a concerted effort to dodge my closeness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, with his usual impetuous nature, he would have pounced by now&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, for some reason, he was surprisingly rational.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, we've made it to the underground parking lot, just hang in there a bit longer."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="791.html">« Prev</a><a href="793.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
