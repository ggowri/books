Instead of spewing lies here, why don't you check the footage and see what really happened! Laura, I used to respect you as an elder, but now, all I feel is contempt. Because, you're not worth my respect at all!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold tone, I finished my words and let go of her collar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it wasn't for the fact that she's Noah's grandma, I'd really want to punch her. She's just so punchable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Laura Bryant, it was I who invited Ms. Mayers here. You see, Mr. Bryant has been calling out her name in his sleep. The doctor even mentioned that Mr. Bryant's rapid recovery has a lot to do with Ms. Mayers' company. So, you've misunderstood Ms. Mayers."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Barry walked in. In front of Laura, he stammered out a defense for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura probably never imagined that Barry, always quiet and obedient, would actually speak up in my defense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mouth fell open in shock, words failing her. She probably felt that Barry's words had slapped her in the face, and she snapped back fiercely:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out, who gave you the right to speak here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up, Barry, don't go just yet!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had Laura's words faded than I hollered at Barry. Barry, initially frightened, was about to bolt. But my shout stopped him in his tracks. He turned around mechanically, like a robot, staring at me with a face full of fear, as if he'd been petrified.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pull up the surveillance footage from earlier, let Laura get a good look at it. And while you're at it, have the doctor check out what's going on with Elliott."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'm on it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, judging by Elliott's current state, he should be waking up soon. To avoid any misunderstandings, I won't be coming over anymore. I wouldn't want certain people thinking they've birthed a prince and everyone's after him. Little do they know, even princes can be rejected. I'm done with it. Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though I was speaking to Barry, my words were truly meant for Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished speaking, it was clear as day that Laura was seething with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a cold chuckle, swiftly straightening out my clothes. I grabbed my trench coat from the hanger, slipping it on with ease, ready to leave Elliott's hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, I cast a long, lingering glance towards the direction of the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a blink, I tucked away all my emotions and swiftly made my exit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Laura to come chasing after me. She hollered from behind:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you haven't answered my question from earlier. Did you have the baby, or did you miscarry? Was it a boy or a girl?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, I didn't expect she'd still be hung up on my kid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left me feeling a mix of amusement and annoyance. I turned to face her, and memories of the past insults I had endured from her flooded back, leaving a stifling sensation in my chest:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of your damn business."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I responded to her, then turned on my heel, striding confidently towards the elevator.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, out of the corner of my eye, I caught sight of the woman named Lisa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was less than ten meters away from me, leaning casually against the wall, dressed in a burgundy coat with a delicate belt loosely tied around her waist. One of her legs was hooked back against the wall, one hand in her pocket, a slender cigarette hanging from her lips. Her eyes were slightly squinted, her head tilted as she looked in my direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was absolutely certain her gaze was fixed on me. Her stare was unabashed, radiating a potent hostility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman truly lives up to her name, resembling a fox to a tee. The way her narrow eyes fixate on people, it's both mysterious and eerie.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down my spine, unbidden. Marcus's words from earlier drifted into my mind, uninvited.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman, she's not only versed in pharmacology, but also skilled in some unique treatment methods.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="769.html">« Prev</a><a href="771.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
