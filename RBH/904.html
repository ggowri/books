Right, Quinn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before </span><span>Quinn </span><span>could finish, I blurted out, cutting him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn </span><span>was stunned. He looked at me in shock, a complex emotion flashing through his eyes. His lips moved, but in the end, he didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what </span><span>happened</span><span> me </span><span>at</span><span> that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew what Quinn </span><span>was trying</span><span> to tell him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I realized I was deeply afraid. Afraid the truth would be too much for </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. Afraid that if his emotions became unstable, something bad might happen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid that once certain words were spoken, there would be no turning back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Well</span><span>, at least </span><span>there&rsquo;s</span><span> some comfort."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> looked at me, his eyes filled </span><span>deeply </span><span>with a heartbreaking sense of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, </span><span>as you said</span><span>, we are divorced now, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked me again, tentatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, lowering my head to avoid his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at me with dark, intense eyes:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, no matter how happy we seemed recently, you were just acting, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused, then slowly raised my head to look at him:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not entirely. There were moments when I was genuinely happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> gave a faint smile, one filled with indescribable emotions. He slowly stood up:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me some time. I'll talk to Dr. Jones and Barry to find out what really happened. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if you ask me how I feel after knowing all this, my only feeling is, Madeline, I sincerely hope you are the one who will never leave me, no matter what happens."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> finished with a </span><span>slight</span><span> sigh. Then, he slowly turned around, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart felt a sharp pain, like a bee sting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched his back, took a deep breath, but my heart ached terribly for </span><span>no</span><span> reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> opened the door, his steps unsteady, his tall figure radiating deep sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I </span><span>moved</span><span> my lips and instinctively stood up, feeling an urge to chase after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Quinn grabbed me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just watched </span><span>Elliott</span><span> drag </span><span>himself</span><span> away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room quickly fell silent again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn tried to say something, but I turned around, a surge of instinctive anger filling my chest. I couldn't help but </span><span>yell at him</span><span>:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you </span><span>happy</span><span> now? You've </span><span>told him</span><span> everything, </span><span>is that what you want</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My emotions became restless</span><span> for no reason</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Quinn was the most wronged and tolerant one in all this, but at that moment, I couldn't stop myself from lashing out at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what was </span><span>going on</span><span> </span><span>with</span><span> me. I felt like I was being dragged into an abyss of emotions, not even understanding what I was doing or thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind was a chaotic mess, indescribably chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was stunned by my </span><span>anger</span><span>. He looked at me, his eyes filled with disbelief:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you blaming me? Are you blaming me for telling him the truth, or for ruining your chance to </span><span>get back together</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His last words were spoken so softly, as if </span><span>hidden</span><span> with immense grievance, making my heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had my plan. I knew what I was doing. But now, you've </span><span>told</span><span> everything ahead of time, and my plan is completely ruined. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know what to do now, or if </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s condition </span><span>would</span><span> ever improve. Everything is destroyed, do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>No</span><span>!" Quinn</span><span>&rsquo;s </span><span>tone was firmer than ever. He held my shoulders</span><span> and looked</span><span> into my eyes. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I already told you</span><span> that</span><span> your plan won't work. Dr. Jones' three-month timeline was just an excuse. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if you continued pretending with </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, he wouldn't regain his memory in three months. Don't you see? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you keep this up, you'll only hurt yourself. Madeline, I'm trying to help you move on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need your help! I know what I'm doing</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed Quinn</span><span>&rsquo;s</span><span> hand</span><span>s</span><span> away, snapping at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't </span><span>understand</span><span>. If you keep going like this, you'll fall for him again. Do you really want to repeat the same mistake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn </span><span>shouted at me helplessly, his eyes filled with </span><span>heartache</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew he was looking out for me, but the indescribable emotion in my chest made me refuse to acknowledge his words:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's none of your business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn </span><span>was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I've been meddling too much, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, who had never raised his voice at me, suddenly spoke louder. He looked at me, his eyes clearly showing anger:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems I've been the one </span><span>deceiving</span><span> myself all along. I'm the one who forced myself between you and </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. I'm the one who ruined your relationship, and now I'm the one tearing apart your dream, forcing you back to cold reality. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's all my fault. </span><span>And I deserved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You two love each other, and I'm the third wheel. Madeline, </span><span>I&rsquo;m done</span><span>! If this is how you feel, let's end it here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn'</span><span>s</span><span> emotions became more intense than ever. His sudden outburst startled me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized I had been a bit unreasonable. I </span><span>quickly</span><span> tried to grab his sleeve:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I didn't mean that. Don't be mad, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he pushed my hand away. He looked at me, his eyes full of disappointment:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not angry, just disappointed. </span><span>It turns out n</span><span>o matter what I do or how </span><span>well</span><span> I </span><span>treat</span><span> you, I'll </span><span>never measure up to </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. </span><span>As long as</span><span> he beckons, you</span><span> would</span><span> fall for him </span><span>at once</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline, this time, I </span><span>decide to let you go</span><span>. If you want to get back with him, go ahead. I won't stop you. But I hope you think it through and consider if he's really worth it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn </span><span>looked at me and slowly finished speaking. Then, he turned around angrily and started to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him like this, I hurried forward to explain again.</span><span> But</span><span> </span><span>Quinn </span><span>walked </span><span>so fast</span><span>, without saying another word to me. Soon, he disappeared from my sight.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="903.html">« Prev</a><a href="905.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
