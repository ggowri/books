I hadn't expected him to be so considerate and cooked for us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached, the distinct aroma of cereal wafted over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was thoughtful, not only preparing cereal but also laying out snacks on exquisite plates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brown, what medicine did you give me last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat down and looked at Marcus, his eyes filled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had been running a fever for several days. He naturally understood that he was feeling so much better because of Marcus' medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I prepared the medicine based on the anti-flu capsules you recommended last time. It seems to be quite effective," Marcus honestly replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's gaze turned serious immediately, and I sensed trouble brewing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially uninterested in Marcus' development of this medicine, Elliott's sudden interest caught me off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, Elliott said, "If this medicine is indeed so effective, we could consider a partnership. With this flu outbreak, hospitals are overwhelmed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearing Marcus' agreement, I quickly glanced at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding my silent plea, Marcus hesitantly responded, "Mr. Bryant, to be honest, since your company never gave me a clear response, I've already secured a partnership with someone else, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, being experienced in the business field, clearly recognized the huge business opportunity presented by this medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even said, "Have you signed a contract with the other party? If not, I can offer a higher price based on our previous negotiations. It's all negotiable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Elliott's words, I grew anxious and interjected, "Since Mr. Brown has spoken, he must have already signed with the other party. You're jumping the gun here. It's not quite right. When Mr. Brown sincerely approached you for cooperation, you didn't respond."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sipping his cereal, Elliott suddenly glanced at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to understand something from my expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said meaningfully, "Is the new partner Mr. Brown mentioned you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to admit that Elliott was remarkably perceptive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few words from me could let him easily grasp my meaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Even if I don't admit it, the news will eventually come out, and Elliott will find out sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I decided to come clean. "Yes, Marcus and I have already agreed to collaborate. The development of this medicine will commence soon. I'm sorry, you're a step too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words darkened Elliott's expression instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He set down his spoon and remarked in a serious voice, "Madeline, this isn't the first time you've stolen my business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apparently, he was very displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I, too, set down my spoon and looked up at him, saying, "The business world is like a battlefield. To profit, everyone must rely on their own abilities. Isn't that what you said? Besides, you didn't seize the opportunity yourself. You didn't give Marcus a clear response. It's reasonable for me to become his new partner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think we need to have a private conversation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's expression grew gloomier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the tension between us, Marcus stood up tactfully and said, "You two should talk alone. I'll go upstairs to organize the pharmacy's ingredients."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus left, Elliott bypassed the coffee table and sat down next to me. He stared at me with his gaze akin to a lion whose territory had been repeatedly encroached upon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, everyone must rely on their own abilities. But we are husband and wife, you don't need to be at odds with me at every turn. Madeline, I didn't keep looking into the copyright for Do Not Love. What more do you want from me?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="481.html">« Prev</a><a href="483.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
