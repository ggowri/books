I had already been very relieved about all of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like you have truly let go. On the other hand, he has now ended up getting trapped," Sylvia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she could see that I really have no feelings for Elliott anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let him go. I was a bit tired. Sylvia, take good care of yourself. We are going back first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said helplessly. Afterward, I bid farewell to Sylvia and left the hospital with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way back, Quinn didn't say anything at first. However, as we were getting close to my house, he suddenly took a deep breath and then grabbed my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, listen to me, let's get engaged. After we get engaged, I will take you and the child abroad to live. This way, Elliott will never be able to bother you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's sudden proposal caught me off guard, and I couldn't help but pause for a moment, "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We had a beautiful estate in Tomworth, with a large lawn, a vast orchard, and an artificial lake. It was a great place for children to grow up, and the climate there was also pleasant, better than in our home country. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abroad? I haven't thought about it yet, after all, Austin and Lily are both in the country. Besides, Glory Group is currently in need as well. Going abroad now, I feel it's not very realistic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head and then said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Glory Group's current business is becoming stable, so you can definitely find a reliable career agent to manage it. You just need to oversee it from behind the scenes. As for Austin and Lily, they can go live there together. It is also suitable for them to retire there," Quinn smiled and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out he was planning this in his mind during his silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomworth...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was indeed a great country. The most important thing was that it was far away from Elliott, far enough to have no contact with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me think about it first. Let me discuss it with Austin and Lily. However, getting engaged is out of the question. Quinn, I've already told you, you've been good enough to me. I can't hold you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, I couldn't bear to let you fall into that quagmire of Elliott again. If possible, I hope you choose to be with me. Don't you think I am more suitable for you than Elliott?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn kept saying. However, I felt that I didn't deserve him to go to such lengths for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, stop talking. At this stage, I just want to focus on giving birth to the child. As for love, we can discuss it later. Besides, you deserve a better woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have owed Quinn enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really didn't want to continue like this anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chose to act with him before because Elliott and Giselle got together, but now that they have ended, there is no need for me to continue acting with Quinn either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I didn't feel that way. Madeline, you have already worked so hard before, so now don't think too much and just be at peace with me. Isn't it great if we raise the baby together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said to me in a deep voice. The tone of his voice, which indicated that he would take full responsibility for me, made me feel as if he had truly considered the baby in my belly as his own...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="680.html">« Prev</a><a href="682.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
