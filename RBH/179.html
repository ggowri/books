Otherwise, why would I ask you to come and pick me up, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, you have no idea what Elliott drugged you with. You loved him for so many years, and yet you were reduced to dust, unable to gain even a bit of his kindness. Madeline, don't be so foolish in the future. It's not worth it to sacrifice yourself for a scumbag."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona sighed and thought I was still stubborn, so she advised me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it, Ms. Tucker, you were sober. By the way, I heard you were involved in a lawsuit recently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh and stick out my tongue, and I asked her with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was taken aback by my question and then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did you hear this from? Yeah, I'm so frustrated. I found out that someone plagiarized the academic paper I published. It was the result of my research for a whole six months. It really infuriated me. However, the lawyer I hired is pretty good. I should be able to win the lawsuit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh... The lawyer was not bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled ambiguously in an instant, I pushed Fiona's shoulder and winked playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder which lawyer received such affirmation from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona understood the meaning behind my words. A rare blush appeared on her usually plain face. She pretended to be impatient and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, come on, he's just a lawyer. Why do you ask so many questions? Geez."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rarely saw such a shy expression on Fiona's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that, just as Quinn said, Fiona might really have had some different feelings towards Alexis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and didn't ask any further, and at that moment, the ambulance had already arrived at the hospital where Fiona was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have a good friend who is a doctor. Without me having to spend any effort, Fiona has already arranged a hospital room for me, found a specialist doctor, and completed the hospital admission procedures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instructed Fiona not to let anyone know about my transfer to this place. She patted her chest, indicating that she understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After doing all of this, I lay peacefully on the hospital bed, even though the ward was far from luxurious as Elliott had provided, but my heart finally found tranquility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My phone rang several times, but I didn't answer because the missed calls were all from Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably realized that I had been discharged, but given his personality, it was already rare for him to make a few phone calls to me. I guess if I didn't answer his calls, he should understand what I meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suppose Elliott wouldn't call me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona had my attending physician reassess my condition, and after conducting some relevant examinations, he informed me that I would be able to be discharged in about three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam has been constantly reporting the progress of the filming in Louis City to me. During this time, he has been staying in Louis City. In between reporting work, he occasionally sends me various delicious snacks from Louis City and tells me that it truly deserves to be called an ancient city of a thousand years, with so much good food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had a sudden idea and thought about staying in Louis City for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since we couldn't get divorced for the time being, it seems like a good choice to stay away from Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not having to breathe in the same city as Elliott and Giselle, perhaps, would make me feel more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, I made a decision in my mind. I decided that once I was discharged from the hospital, I would move and stay in Louis City for a while.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="178.html">« Prev</a><a href="180.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
