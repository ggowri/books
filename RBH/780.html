I just miss you too much. Seeing you, I can't help but want to kiss you. Hit me, hit me as you please."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed my hand and slammed it against his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was indeed angry, and I pounded on his chest a few times. Then I remembered that he had been injured there, and I quickly stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't flinch, letting me pound on him. A faint, satisfied smile still lingered on his face. Seeing me stop, he asked me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you cooled off now? If you are, let's head home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finished speaking and smoothly hooked his arm around my waist, intending to lead me away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was already so unhinged just now. If I were to go back with him, who knows what he might do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a rush, I pushed him away, taking two steps back:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you head on home. I've got some business to take care of at the company."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott swiveled around, giving me a puzzled look:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Madeline, why have you turned so cold towards me now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked utterly innocent, completely baffled by my indifference.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it. He's lost his memory. Right now, his mind is stuck in that sweetest time before our divorce. It's only natural he'd be surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, I could only muster the patience to say in a nonchalant manner:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I want is to do my job well and manage the business of Glory Group. I really can't go back now. I'll have Barry take you home to rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll have dinner ready. Just remember to come back and eat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was still confused, but he didn't press me for answers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I might not be able to make it back. I've been staying at my mom's place lately, so you'll have to fend for yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was terrified he might actually wait for me to eat. So, I hastily said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliot looked at me, a mix of helplessness and melancholy in his eyes. He raised his hand, pressing the corners of his brows. The moment he lowered his head, he looked like a picture of bottled-up grievances:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you still upset with me for not having dinner with you before, Madeline? I promise you, I'll change. I won't treat you with the same coldness as before. Please, don't be so cold to me either, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's gaze was fixed on me, a boundless tenderness in his eyes that left me momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he truly suffering from amnesia, or is he just trying to win me back?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly found myself a bit confused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter what he does, I won't be swayed again, easily falling into his tender trap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I'm not brushing you off, I really do have things to handle. Besides, we both have our careers, there's no need to make this all melodramatic, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rubbed my temples. I had softened my tone as much as possible to accommodate his condition. But to utter those intimate words, I just couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I got it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't persist. He just offered a faint smile, tinged with a hint of melancholy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily left the hospital, driving straight back home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been by Elliot's side these past few days, haven't seen Noah in a while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I stepped through the door, I made a beeline for Noah's nursery. I was eager to see if my little one had grown.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad and mom are gathered around Noah's crib, teasing him. They're laughing joyfully.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="779.html">« Prev</a><a href="781.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
