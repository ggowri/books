That's why I'm telling you this outside the ward. Let's not tell Paige for now. We'll wait until she recovers," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Although Jezebel didn't have to go to jail, she couldn't possibly stay in showbiz anymore," I said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, I called Ken and told him to spread all the immoral behavior of Jezebel that he had investigated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken conducted a casual investigation and discovered that Jezebel had engaged in many immoral activities except for having an affair with Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every misdeed of hers was enough to get herself expelled from the showbiz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, various rumors and videos about Jezebel spread freely on the internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It went viral. Although the PR department of the Bryant Group was capable, they were unable to stop the never-ending news about Jezebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a week, no one in showbiz dared to mention Jezebel again. All of her works and endorsements were taken down. From then on, there was no Jezebel in showbiz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel was ridiculous. She had fallen to such a state, yet she wanted to imitate Giselle by threatening her company with suicide. She wanted the company to find a way to help her resolve this crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter how she cried and shouted on the roof, no one paid any attention to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An artist who had been boycotted by the entire internet was completely worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A week later, Ken called me and asked me to take him to the restaurant he specified for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant was extremely expensive. However, I didn't hesitate when ordering and had the waiter bring me delicacies such as matsutake mushrooms, and caviar. Additionally, I ordered the most expensive red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken was very satisfied with this meal. He leaned in and said with a smile, "Madeline, Jezebel is quite interesting. In order to lift the ban on her, she went to the garages of those executives who had slept with her in the past. One time, she was almost disfigured by one of the executive's wife, and another time she was nearly crippled by a bodyguard. She is now acting like a madwoman, threatening to take these people down with her. Her behavior has already scared some of them. Maybe we don't need to do anything to her. Someone will make her disappear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She had already been this down and out, but how could she not know how to restrain herself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt very confused when I heard Ken's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She had already gotten used to taking shortcuts and would find it difficult to adapt to a normal life. She might not even know why she suddenly turned out this way. How could she possibly restrain herself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken shrugged. Over the years, he had followed too many celebrities and witnessed too many of their downfall. He had long been accustomed to such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Ken and asked, "Ken, you've been tracking Jezebel for a long time. Jezebel has a good friend named Giselle. Did you take any photos of Giselle while tracking Jezebel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This idea suddenly popped into my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jezebel was Giselle's closest friend. Jezebel had committed so many misdeeds that I was afraid that Giselle might not be pure and innocent either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just my guess. Unexpectedly, Ken smiled mysteriously. Then he touched my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I did take photos of the woman."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="622.html">« Prev</a><a href="624.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
