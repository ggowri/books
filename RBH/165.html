If your company is busy, you can focus on your own work, I'm fine anyway, Bonnie, the caregiver, is here to take care of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lowered my head and no longer looked into his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can that be? You have suffered so much for the sake of the company, even if I am busy, I will make time to accompany you. Have you had this chicken noodle soup? If you haven't, I will feed it to you. Aunt Cole did a pretty good job with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aunt Cole?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was puzzled for a moment, and then it dawned on me that Elliott was referring to Giselle's mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Toby took his mother's surname.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, how did Elliott know that Nicole's chicken noodle soup was delicious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has he already been to her house for dinner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like you have tried this chicken noodle soup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart became more bitter, I don't know if it was because I had been hanging the drip all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled slightly and said, "A couple of days ago, we passed by their flower shop and decided to stop by. Aunt Cole happened to have made chicken noodle soup, so she invited Toby and me to have a meal together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was quite frank and didn't hide anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..." I responded, unsure of what else to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Giselle's recent arrival has brought me many questions, I don't want to interrogate Elliott about every little detail. On the one hand, I know he won't answer due to his personality, and on the other hand, I don't want to show that I care too much about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to try?" he asked me again, and then he planned to open the lunch box and serve me the soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's too greasy. I want something light," I shook my head in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how delicious this chicken noodle soup was, as long as it was brought by Giselle, I felt repulsed in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shall I go nearby and buy you a bowl of oatmeal porridge?" He showed great patience, even though he could have easily instructed someone else to do these things, but he meant that he would do it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." He was so considerate, I couldn't let him down either, so I nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You go ahead and rest your eyes for a while, I'll be back," Elliott stood up and before I could say anything, he leaned down and gently kissed my forehead, then quickly turned and hurried out of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ward suddenly became quiet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind was fuzzy, and I quickly fell back into a deep sleep. I didn't know how long had passed when a commotion in the hallway startled me awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I opened my eyes, to my surprise, I saw Laura and Jasper rushing into the doorway of the ward with a few people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Laura saw me, she immediately rushed over and grabbed my hand, saying with concern, "My dear, I came right away as soon as I heard you were injured. You are a great hero of our Bryant Group this time. Elliott said if it weren't for you discovering the hidden danger in time, our exhibition would have had a big problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Baby... this is a title Laura has never had before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled slightly and quickly said, "Mom, it's nothing. I am also a member of the Bryant family. It has been raining heavily these days, and I was worried, so I went to the scene to take a look. Actually, I didn't do much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you truly are a good daughter-in-law of our Bryant family. Both Jasper and I were relieved to hear about this matter. Take good care of your injury, let me know if there's anything you want to eat, and I will personally make it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was filled with satisfaction and gratitude at this moment. It was evident that what I had done this time pleased them greatly.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="164.html">« Prev</a><a href="166.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
