Ken, being the seasoned entertainment journalist he was, managed to obtain these photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these old scandals were to surface, while they might not completely ruin Jezebel's career, they would certainly tarnish the image she had carefully crafted for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timing the release of this information while the show was in the midst of massive promotion would undoubtedly have a significant impact on its viewership ratings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately messaged Ken. [Ken, the timing is right. You can release it now...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken quickly replied with a sly grin emoji. [Got it, I will arrange it right away.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at the chat window, and an evil smirk crept onto my face involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to admit that I became a bit wicked this time, but I didn't feel guilty about it. Since Elliott had kept Giselle's recommendation of the leading actress from me and even signed her as a talent under his label, I knew I had to make him realize the cost of his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he himself had said that the business world was like a battlefield. If he insisted on competing with me, then I would accept the challenge head</span><span>-</span><span>on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was no longer the useless and foolish girl I used to be. From that moment on, I would fight tooth and nail for every inch of ground not only in the entertainment industry but also in every business sector.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, I would make Elliott see that he was no longer the high and mighty figure in my eyes, and I was no longer the pitiful girl groveling at his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in thought as I stared at my phone, I suddenly felt him gently wrap his arms around my waist from behind and rest his head on my neck, whispering softly, "What are you doing? You're taking so long to brush your teeth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I jerked back, realizing I had been lost in my thoughts, and hastily closed the chat window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was careless, forgetting that I was still with Elliott, and I wasn't sure if he caught a glimpse of what I was chatting about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But my phone screen was dim, and I had a privacy screen protector, so it</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s unlikely he saw anything, right? Shaking off my reverie, I instinctively pushed away his hand resting on my waist and made an excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing much. I was just replying to a friend's text."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." Sensing my aloofness, he let go of me, then casually added, "After Do Not Love finishes airing, Allure will follow suit. Seems like Do Not Love has been well received in terms of ratings and feedback. I didn't realize you had such a good taste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to be praising me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling subtly, I probed. "Things are okay for now, but Allure airing during the Christmas season gives it quite the edge. And considering Bryant Group's extensive promotional efforts compared to ours, are you aiming to overshadow Do Not Love intentionally?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned to me, his gaze carrying a mix of emotions that was difficult to discern, and he unexpectedly remarked, "I don't intend to engage in a competition with you. If you're concerned about Allure outperforming Do Not Love in ratings, I can have them reschedule it after Christmas."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="410.html">« Prev</a><a href="412.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
