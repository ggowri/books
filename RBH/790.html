I couldn't help but take another glance at the wine in the glass, yet I still couldn't ascertain if the problem lay with the wine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so many girls present, I absolutely can't lose my cool in public.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recognizing this, I forced myself to stand upright and head out. However, no sooner had I stepped out of the room than I felt the ground beneath me soften. My vision started to blur.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flurry, I made my way towards the bathroom, leaning on the wall for support. As I replayed the recent events in my mind, something felt increasingly off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There must be something fishy about that wine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if there was something wrong with the wine, we all drank it. How come I'm the only one feeling sick?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was utterly baffled. At last, I found myself in the restroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly splashed my face with cold water. However, the chill didn't bring the calm I sought. Instead, it only served to ignite my cerebral cortex into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unusual surge of excitement clouded my mind. And just then, out of nowhere, a pair of large hands wrapped around me from behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even react, I was abruptly hoisted into the air. He pinned me against the bathroom sink.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Quinn, his eyes bloodshot. The look he gave me held a desire that seemed to have been suppressed for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how come you're out here all by yourself? Do you feel... overheated?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn asked," he said, realizing something was off, he let go of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I could clearly sense it, he seemed to be struggling to keep himself from rushing over and embracing me. He was obviously holding back, but it was a battle he was finding hard to win.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the same way as I did. Clearly, something must've been slipped into that drink.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I feel really off, Quinn. I... I think I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found myself staring at Quinn. Despite having no prior attraction towards him, I couldn't help but notice how handsome he looked at that moment. There was this irresistible urge to throw myself at him, to kiss him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Madeline, don't come any closer. I... I'm afraid I won't be able to resist."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me wanting to approach, Quinn frantically waved his hands in protest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spun around swiftly, cranked open the faucet, and then doused his face mercilessly with cold water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, at that moment, I felt an intense heat coursing through me, a heat I could hardly bear. Without thinking, I stepped forward, wrapping my arms around Quinn's waist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was in utter misery. And when I pulled him into a hug, Quinn's whole body trembled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned, his crimson eyes locking onto mine. He cradled my face, the desire in his gaze growing ever more apparent:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what's happening between us? I want to... I really want to... But I can't, I can't betray you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was murmuring incessantly. His face was inching closer and closer to mine. However, just as he was about to kiss me, it seemed as if the rational part of him overpowered the effects of the drug. He quickly let go of me and turned to face the wall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed his body trembling incessantly, a result of excessive endurance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at him in this state, I was absolutely certain that there was something off about the drink we just had. Otherwise, there's no way we'd be feeling this awful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, hurry... get someone to take us to the hospital for a stomach pump."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, I was at the end of my tether. It felt like a million ants were crawling inside me. I was fighting the overwhelming urge to pounce on Quinn, using the last shred of my sanity to speak to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if Quinn had just snapped back to reality. He quickly fished out his phone to call the lobby manager at his club.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I... I'm really struggling."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning against the wall, I could barely keep myself upright. The heat was unbearable, forcing me to peel off my mesh top. But it was still too hot, and without thinking, I found myself wanting to shed my white T-shirt.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="789.html">« Prev</a><a href="791.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
