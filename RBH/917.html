I'll keep trying. The current you, like a legendary treasure, is even more precious to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said this and then hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that such a confession was not easy for someone as cold and aloof as he used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he said was already his limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I told him all this to let him know that everything he did for me was in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unexpectedly, he became even more determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that when a woman chose to be herself and live for herself, it made her even more valuable to a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time I experienced this feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After these two calls, my previously heavy heart felt light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not having to force myself to make a choice felt really good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood up, walked to the office's floor-to-ceiling window, and felt the sunlight quietly streaming through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a strong urge to go out and explore popped into my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sent a message in my best friends' group chat:Want to see the world, domestic or abroad, Does anyone want to join? I'll cover all expenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I sent the message, the other two replied excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige first sent a surprised emoji, then quickly replied: Really? Ms. Mayers covers all expenses?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sent a smug emoji and answered: Of course.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona also appeared immediately: Really? I was planning to take a vacation. How about Korea? I want to eat authentic kimchi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige quickly responded: Korea sounds good, I want to see Korean guys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled: I'm fine with anything. You guys decide the time, and I'll arrange my work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige replied instantly: I'm free anytime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona followed: I have two scheduled surgeries, but should be free after next Wednesday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I replied: Okay, let's set off next Wednesday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and Fiona immediately celebrated with fireworks in the chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their excitement reminded me that the last time we traveled together was right after college graduation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, I got married, and they got busy with their careers and studies. We never traveled together again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, I told my parents about my plan to travel abroad, and they fully supported it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me in good spirits, my mom said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead, you haven't rested well in the past two years, and childbirth took a toll on you. You should go out and relax. Don't worry, Noah has me, your dad, and Malina. Enjoy your trip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, life is about balancing work and rest. Career is important, but so is health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad echoed my mom's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, I quickly handled some work, held a meeting with the executives, and delegated everything that needed attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I covered the expenses, Paige booked the tickets and hotels, and planned the itinerary, while Fiona prepared daily necessities and skincare products for the trip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt relaxed; they had everything arranged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day of our trip, Noah had just recovered from his cold. I reluctantly said goodbye to Noah and my parents, then happily drove to the airport with Paige and Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the weather warmed up, the three of us switched to travel-friendly long dresses, all in the same style but in different colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige chose a fiery red, I went with a bright sunflower yellow, and Fiona picked a refreshing avocado green.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of us carried a suitcase and wore the same white sneakers. We boarded the plane to Seoul, South Korea, ready for adventure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We arrived in Korea at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had pre-booked a hotel that sent a car to pick us up. After checking in, we immediately went out to find some food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had already done her research, so we headed straight to a Korean restaurant she had found earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once seated, we were starving and quickly ordered a ton of food. Then, we started taking photos like crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Traveling without men was a unique kind of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We couldn't stop laughing, especially when reminiscing about our fun times in school. Everyone was so happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been so long since I felt this free, don't you think, Fiona?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I savored the authentic Korean food and couldn't help but sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, the last time we went wild like this was ten years ago. Tonight, I definitely want to hit a bar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona took a deep breath, eager to soak in the freedom of being abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's just you two. I often feel free, haha. One of you is always busy being a CEO, and the other is constantly dealing with patients at the hospital. Tonight, let's meet some hot Korean guys. I'll show you around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige grinned, ready to lead us on a fun night out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hot Korean guys, count me in!" Fiona's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't met any yet, but I'm excited to see some tonight," I said, getting interested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"OK! There's a popular bar nearby. The DJ is a former Korean singer who had some famous hits back in the day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was thrilled, rubbing her hands together in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Fiona and I got excited too. We quickly finished our meal and headed to the bar Paige mentioned, arm in arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We arrived at the bar around 10 PM, just as it was getting crowded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three single women entering a bar instantly caught the attention of many young men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had just sat down when two handsome guys approached us, speaking fluent Korean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Korean was so-so, but Paige had studied in Korea before and was quite fluent. She quickly started chatting with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the guys invited us to join them at their table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being in a foreign country, Fiona and I were a bit hesitant about mingling with strangers, but Paige was fearless and dragged us along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige quickly got acquainted with the guys while Fiona and I followed quietly, arm in arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bar was dimly lit, with countless shadows moving around us. Suddenly, I thought I saw a familiar figure...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="916.html">« Prev</a><a href="918.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
