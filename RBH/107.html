I glanced over and happened to catch Fiona and Alexis exchanging a glance, and Fiona seemed unexpectedly shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took another look at Alexis and saw him sitting there like an iceberg. Surprisingly, he had a faint smile on his face, and his gaze remained fixed on Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, it seemed like I understood something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis is now a rising star in the legal field. He wears gold-rimmed glasses and is tall and thin, giving him a refined appearance. Perhaps due to his years of litigation, his gaze appears very wise. He gives me a sense of calmness, speaks sparingly, and has a clean demeanor. To be honest, he is indeed the type that Fiona would appreciate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Fiona was always devoted to her career, she also paid attention to her appearance. She was about 5.3 feet tall and had a very slim figure. She had short hair and looked smart and refreshing. She also wore glasses. Both in terms of appearance and profession, she was a perfect match for Alexis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Paige had known it long ago, so she had the intention to match them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this moment, Quinn started making a fuss again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you two play or not? Don't waste time, hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kiss me! Kiss me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others immediately joined in, clapping and cheering, instantly creating an atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis stood up at this moment and walked up to Fiona on his own initiative. He cupped Fiona's face and then quickly leaned in, really kissing Fiona...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone at the scene couldn't help but cheer and began to count down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From my perspective, I found that Alexis was actually very tactful. He intentionally blocked everyone's view with his palm, but in reality, his lips were very close to Fiona's, yet he didn't actually kiss her. He cleverly positioned himself and didn't really take this opportunity to offend the beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty seconds quickly passed amidst everyone's countdown, and Alexis released his hand at the right moment. He still had a smile on his face, while Fiona's face had already turned as red as an apple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never seen Fiona being rational before, and yet she had such a shy side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Paige and I couldn't help but exchange glances, and both of us smiled at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The game continued quickly, and this time, Alexis spun the bottle, and as a result, the mouth of the bottle pointed towards Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige turned the dial and to her surprise, this time the instruction was: invite any boy from the audience and dance Latin for one minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This instruction was not only challenging but also tested one's dancing skills. However, Paige had just learned Latin dance before, so it was not difficult for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did anyone step forward voluntarily to dance with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige has always been open-minded and straightforward, and she immediately issued an invitation on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, the next moment, Philip immediately stood up and exclaimed loudly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it had to be me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip finished speaking and immediately started, twisting his body and moving directly in front of Paige, making a gesture of invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, Philip actually knew how to dance Latin. His moves were very professional, which made Paige suddenly feel competitive. She decided to boldly take off her coat in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige only had one black cropped vest, and it was the kind that only covered half of her torso. Her slender and fair waist was instantly revealed, while the tight denim shorts perfectly accentuated her perky buttocks, magnifying her physical advantages in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them loved to play, so Paige immediately started moving her body and danced with Philip right on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hot and spicy music of Latin dance, combined with the extremely passionate dance moves of the two, instantly elevated the atmosphere of the entire scene to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood among the crowd, looking at this group of lively friends in front of me, and I increasingly felt that my previous self in the past had truly missed out on so many wonderful moments for the sake of so-called love.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="106.html">« Prev</a><a href="108.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
