We were playing and fooling around in the fields, and ended up covered in mud. Later on, I made this trinket as a gift for you. Right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly recalled the joyful childhood he had spent with Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle nodded with a bright smile and shining eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! After that, I never saw you again. But I have always cherished this ornament. Mr. Bryant, can I still call you Elliott?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! If you were free, I could take you to my house for dinner. My parents would be very happy to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Elliott and Giselle sincerely lock eyes, I even felt happy for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finally understood why Elliott had always loved Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle and Elliott used to grow up together and had such wonderful memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't seen your parents for a long time either! I was able to go to college and pursue my interests thanks to the help of your family. My mom has always hoped for a chance to visit your home too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's words were sincere and genuine. However, as a fellow girl, I could keenly perceive her undeniable admiration for Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Giselle has treasured this little trinket for so many years, perhaps for her, Elliott was the star she couldn't have. And Rowan was an ordinary boyfriend she reluctantly chose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Elliott showed even a hint of appreciation or sympathy towards her, I believe Giselle would go to great lengths to get closer to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, they met a little late. After all, I had already married Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't let them reminisce so intimately anymore! If sparks were to fly between them, it would be difficult to put out the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately walked up and shook Elliott's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and said, "Giselle, I didn't realize you spent your childhood with my husband. Let us know if you need our help in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I declared my sovereignty. Giselle instantly became sober and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle withdrew her gaze and said, "Okay. Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Bryant. Mr. Bryant's agreement to collaborate with our family's flower shop has already been a great help to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't mention it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott noticed that Giselle became reserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said, "No need to be polite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I agreed with Elliott's words, but in my mind, I cursed, "If I don't stop you guys, this bitch will eventually throw me into the sea again. Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very angry, but Giselle had already started giving flowers to Elliott, so I had to think of another way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Giselle left Elliott's office, I also left because I was not in a good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked to the elevator and found Giselle standing there, waiting for the elevator. So, I entered the elevator with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only Giselle and me in the elevator. To be honest, I felt a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Giselle was the first to break the silence...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="92.html">« Prev</a><a href="94.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
