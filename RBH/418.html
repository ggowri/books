Glory Group won't crumble on my watch. Now that you're awake, Mom and I can breathe easy. You just concentrate on getting better. With me holding down the fort at Glory Group, you have nothing to worry about," I assured my father firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that apart from my mother and me, the thing he cherished most in his life was Glory Group, the company he had built from scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ease his mind and let him focus on recovery, I immediately recounted everything I had done at Glory Group during his hospital stay. His joy knew no bounds when he heard that Jade and Tom had been brought to justice and that the film and television project I had invested in had been a roaring success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin, who had barely eaten and survived on liquids, surprisingly finished a bowl of soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sought out my father's attending physician and expressed my intention to take him home for rest. The doctor was initially hesitant, but seeing that I was firm, he finally agreed and signed the discharge papers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I told the doctor not to bother informing Elliott as he was busy. I would inform him myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, without informing Elliott, my mother and I arranged for my father's discharge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to bother anyone, but I was unsure if Fiona or Paige had slipped the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As my mother and I wheeled my father towards the hospital's entrance, I saw Quinn pulling up in his flashy SUV at the hospital gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a casual black outfit and looked slightly leaner. His hair was cropped into a trendy buzz cut and even adorned with a striking black diamond earring. With his hands in his pockets, he stood cool and laid-back in front of the SUV, exuding a wild yet carefree vibe from head to toe. He looked at me, half-smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled unconsciously as I approached him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what brings you here?" I asked with a smile, feeling an innate warmth whenever I saw him. I reached out and gave his shoulder a friendly pat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin's discharged, and you didn't even give me a heads up. It's just you and Lily taking care of Austin and handling everything. How do you manage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chided me in a brotherly tone, patted my head, and then bypassed me to greet my parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn had been frequenting the hospital lately. Lily and he had grown quite acquainted. Though Austin had only just awakened, he seemed to recognize Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Lily had filled Austin in. Seeing Quinn, Austin didn't maintain the same aloofness as before. Instead, he smiled and exchanged a few words with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn loaded our belongings into his car. Then, he helped my mother and me lift my father into the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to admit that men had a natural advantage in physical labor. His assistance saved us a lot of effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everything settled, Quinn and I discussed the plan. He would drive his car with my parents and the belongings while I led the way in mine.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="417.html">« Prev</a><a href="419.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
