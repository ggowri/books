I sat beside her silently but heard her faint sobbing after a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing something was wrong, I quickly threw the blanket away and hugged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, what's wrong? Why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, my baby ... my baby is gone. Yesterday, he still kicked incessantly in my belly. He must hate me for not bringing him to the world. Madeline, I'm so devastated..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige finally stopped pretending to be strong. She collapsed in my arms and cried uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, your baby has left. Don't miss him anymore. It's not your fault. He will hate Philip and Jezebel instead of you. He should not have been a sacrifice in your </span><span>relationship. Stop blaming yourself. Don't cry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I miss him so much. Madeline, I can't fall asleep. Every time I close my eyes, I can't help but think of him. I feel so sad. I have never been sad and hated someone as much as I do now. Why did Philip betray me? I gave him everything I had. Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige cried her heart out, and her agonizing accusations made me sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't deserve your love for him. You shouldn't punish yourself for his mistakes. Don't cry, Paige..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept stroking her head and back to comfort her. At that moment, any words seemed useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige cried for a long time and finally fell asleep with my comfort. Looking at her tear-stained face, I was sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had experienced the pain of being betrayed, and I hoped my friends would never go through it and wished for them to be in a long-lasting relationship. Unfortunately, there were too many jerks in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, I did not leave. Afraid Paige would be upset, I stayed by her bedside the whole time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had not yet told her parents about the baby, so her family was unaware. Fiona and I were the closest to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona had to work the night shift and would occasionally come to see Paige and me. Worried about me catching a cold, she arranged a bed for me, bringing me a blanket and asking me to rest next to Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, because of worries about Paige, it wasn't until almost dawn that I finally fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, not long after, I heard someone shouting outside, "She wants to jump off the roof! She's committing suicide!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="614.html">« Prev</a><a href="616.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
