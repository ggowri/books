There was a hint of smugness in her eyes, leaving me puzzled about what she found so satisfying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What would you like to drink? My treat," Giselle said, devoid of courtesy in Elliott's absence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll have an iced Americano." I casually glanced at the menu before asking her directly, "So, what did you want to talk to me about?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle promptly ordered an iced Americano for me, her eyes scrutinizing me intently. Then, she suddenly spoke up. "Cormac told me that none of the Bryant family members were pleased with your marriage to Elliott. If it weren't for your family's insistence, you wouldn't have been able to marry him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her unexpected words left me bewildered. I hadn't anticipated that her purpose in meeting me was to discuss this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then? What's your point?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her, feigning nonchalance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle seemed to be pleased by my shocked reaction as her expression grew even more triumphant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get too smug. Cormac mentioned that if you still haven't conceived Elliott's child, he will soon decide to end your marriage. So, cherish the remaining time you have with Elliott."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Giselle was using Rowan as an excuse to deliver this message to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Observing her expression, I couldn't help but recall the disdainful glances Giselle gave me every time she saw me after winning Elliott in the previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was filled with arrogance, scorn, and contempt. In short, they were far more complex than they appeared now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "She must be feeling quite frustrated at the moment. After all her scheming, progress is slow. At least for now, I am still Elliott's wife, offering her no opportunity."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I continued to feign indifference and chuckled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I divorce Elliott, what does it have to do with you? You claim Rowan is your boyfriend, but it seems to me that you see him as a backup. Your real target is my husband, Elliott, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cut straight to the chase, exposing her facade.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively glanced around before lowering her voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You probably don't even know that if it weren't for you meddling, Elliott and I might have been married by now. Cormac likes me, Jasper and Laura value me. Over the years, they've groomed me to be Elliott's wife, not just supporting my education. Moreover, the Bryant family owes my father a great debt. Jasper's life is worth far more than the two billion dollars your family offered."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left me utterly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bryant family had nurtured her all these years, not just for her education but with the intent of her becoming Elliott's wife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper, Laura, and Cormac had their eyes on her, which explained why she could marry Elliott in the previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but try to recall everything once again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="251.html">« Prev</a><a href="253.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
