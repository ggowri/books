I think he will give up after tonight, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, my heartbeat was still beating fast uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think so. I can feel that he really cares about you now. It's just that he has been unpredictable since he was a child. No one knows what he is thinking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly smiled bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were before, I would be very happy that he finally cared about me, but now I'm not happy at all. I just feel so tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think too much. You're already very tired. You looked pale. I'll take you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my face, Quinn couldn't bear it and said. The concern in his words warmed my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's punch just now was not weak. A bruise soon appeared in the corner of Quinn's eye. I subconsciously reached out and touched his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, does it hurt? I'll accompany you to the hospital. It's all my fault. I get you involved every time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled nonchalantly. He took my hand and pulled me up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't matter. I'm very strong. Just give Elliott some time. After all, he cares about you now, so he will not let you go so easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he still can't let you go, we'll keep acting until he believes it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I whispered and became determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seemed to always have a tacit understanding with me. He immediately agreed and pulled me away from the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sent me home quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already late at night when I got home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the bruises at the corners of his eyes becoming more and more obvious, I felt uneasy, so I just dragged him into my house, trying to find some medicine to help him relieve the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Austin and Lily were still waiting for me in the living room so late at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Quinn and I appear together in the living room, they were a little surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they didn't say much. Lily came over immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why are you back so late? Your father is so worried about you that he doesn't want to go to bed. He's afraid you can't handle it. It would be bad if you drank too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I didn't drink tonight. Quinn accidentally bumped into something and was injured. Do we have any medicine at home that can relieve his pain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'll get it. Quinn, you should sit on the sofa with Madeline first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily nodded immediately and ran to get the medicine box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I signaled Quinn to sit with me on the sofa. As soon as we sat down, I found Austin was examining us, for he was a very perceptive man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I gained a lot from this annual banquet tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended not to understand Austin's look and told him everything that happened in the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Austin regained consciousness, I slowly revealed to him the current business situation of Glory Group from time to time, to let him know that everything was fine at Glory Group, so he could recuperate at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin listened to me patiently, and Lily quickly brought a medicine box. She took out a pill and asked Quinn to take it, and then she took out another ointment and signaled Quinn to apply it to the bruise at the corner of the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily was worried that we didn't have enough to eat at the annual banquet, so she went to the kitchen to make two plates of pasta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were indeed hungry. After eating, I sent Quinn out the door of my house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I was sending him to the car, I suddenly saw a familiar car driving away quickly outside the gate of my house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dazzling car lights made me dizzy. When I saw the license plate clearly, the car left quickly as if with anger, and soon disappeared...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="462.html">« Prev</a><a href="464.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
