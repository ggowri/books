It's true that the world is changing fast, and it's true that it's easy to start a new relationship and a new life whenever you want, but it's hard to hold on to a long</span><span>-</span><span>lasting relationship. Nowadays, the concept of everyone has changed, more and more people are divorced, a relationship is also more and more trials, many relationships can not have a good ending in the end, the original two people who love each other can easily because of a little bit of small things to become strangers. However, if a relationship goes wrong, shouldn't it be the responsibility of both parties? Is giving up really the only reasonable solution? Giving up is really one of the easiest ways to go, it's harder to hold on than to give up.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona rested her cheeks as she made a show of thinking seriously about life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For this relationship between her and her first love, she was thinking about her choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You're thinking like the previous generation, okay?

People have two modes of thinking, one relies on the brain and one relies on the heart. However, no matter how rational the brain is, it is ultimately no match for the heart. I can only follow my heart, and I think most people, in the end, follow their hearts. In fact, there is no point in arguing about this, because very often, how people's hearts think, only they know. Getting back together is fine, starting over is fine, everything follows the heart. When the time comes, there will naturally be an answer.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I said that, both of them were instantly surprised, and the atmosphere, which was still high just now, instantly cooled down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hate to admit it, but you're pretty right.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige chimed in instead of choosing to continue the war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Follow your heart and Follow your mind, you chose the former and so did I.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona reached over and clinked her glass with mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Well, instead of struggling, follow your heart.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, and at that moment, the heavy burden of thoughts in my head was instantly put aside as I tilted my head back and drank the red wine in my glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the bottle of red wine was finished by us, and then, we each went back to our rooms and fell into a deep sleep under the hypnosis of alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the next few days, Elliott not only managed to stay with us throughout the entire trip, but he also planned each day thoroughly and took us to many of Korea's famous online attractions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is said that the best way to observe a man's character is to travel with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the trip, his strengths and weaknesses will be exposed in front of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This trip, which was supposed to be just a girlfriends' trip, turned out to be a test for Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even though it was something he didn't expect, Elliott steadily caught on, and not only did he catch on, but he also showed a lot of sides of himself throughout the trip that I hadn't seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that he spoke Korean so well, and even multiple languages such as French and Japanese, all at the drop of a hat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not only a good golfer, but also a good horseman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that he is not only an outstanding entrepreneur, but he is also quite knowledgeable about astronomy, geography, history and culture, and he knew the sights and customs of any place during the whole trip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole experience was superb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed an excellent guide and throughout the trip, he steadily picked up on Fiona and Paige's questions and was completely unfazed by the fact that even though we spent countless amounts of his money, he spent it as we pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could already see the change in Fiona and Paige's attitude towards him in the way they were softening up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, we planned to fly back home after our last stop at Jeju Island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I never expected that on the morning of our return trip, when I got up from the bed, my brain was dizzy and my body was cold. </span><span>......</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="929.html">« Prev</a><a href="931.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
