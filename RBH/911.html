I only know one thing: I have only one daughter, and I won't let her suffer any more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad waved his hand, averting his gaze in discomfort, clearly not used to such passionate declarations from young people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, when you left Madeline for another woman, you should have expected </span><span>today&rsquo;s situation</span><span>. Now, it's too late to say these things!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom also rejected him coldly and without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know words won't help now. It's okay, I can </span><span>prove</span><span> with actions. If Madeline agrees to reconcile, my dad is willing to give her 20% of the shares, and I'll give her half of mine, making her the largest shareholder of Bryant Group. Is that enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my parents' firm stance, </span><span>Elliott</span><span> took a deep breath and declared his determination to reconcile even more resolutely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> was saying</span><span> that if I agreed to </span><span>forgive him and get back together with him</span><span>, he was willing to hand over the entire Bryant Group to me, making me its head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to value his career above all else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, for me, he was willing to give up even the company he built from scratch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott</span><span>, don't joke about this. Whether I </span><span>will be back</span><span> with you has nothing to do with </span><span>mo</span><span>n</span><span>ey</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>L</span><span>ook</span><span>ing</span><span> at </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, I </span><span>said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you don't care about money, but I want you to know that if you come back to me, I'm willing to share everything important with you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline, I swear, I won't let you </span><span>getting hurt</span><span> like before. I'll make you the </span><span>master</span><span> </span><span>of the Bryant family, standing beside me, not behind me. I know that's what you want too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> walked to my side, holding my shoulders, and spoke to me with deep affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His deep eyes looked so sincere and intense. Through his gaze, I could feel that his eyes were filled with my reflection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I had any doubts about his sincerity before, at this moment, I admit, I was truly moved by the way he looked at me, with eyes full of nothing but me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Really</span><span>? </span><span>You will</span><span> make Madeline the largest shareholder of the Bryant Corporation? </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, that's </span><span>hundreds of </span><span>millions. Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad asked in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he hadn't expected </span><span>Elliott</span><span> to be so generous and willing to make such a concession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I&rsquo;m serious</span><span>, </span><span>Austin</span><span>. Without Madeline, owning the Bryant Corporation</span><span> means nothing.</span><span> Only with </span><span>her</span><span> by my side do I feel truly happy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, I know Madeline doesn't care about </span><span>money</span><span>, but enough </span><span>money</span><span> can give her the sense of safety she needs. I'm willing to give it, as long as she comes back to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> finished speaking to my dad and then turned back to me. His dark eyes shimmered with deep affection, like ripples spreading from my eyes to my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but walk over. In that instant, he </span><span>had </span><span>grasped my cold hand</span><span> before he knew it</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't be swayed by a few sweet words! If you get back with him, what about Quinn?</span><span> What are you going to do with Quinn</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom shouted </span><span>in anxiety</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, my mom</span><span> </span><span>liked</span><span> </span><span>Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively pulled my hand back from </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at my mom, just about to say something, when Malina rushed out of the nursery, shouting urgently at us:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madam, Miss! Noah </span><span>has caught</span><span> a high fever again, it's almost </span><span>104&#8457;</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Malina's shout, everyone lost their composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We all rushed towards the nursery, and </span><span>Elliott</span><span> followed us in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah was lying in his crib, crying loudly. His tiny features were contorted in pain, his face flushed, and his eyes looked dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurried forward and scooped Noah up from the crib, calling his name in distress:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah, Noah, it's Mommy. You're feeling really bad, aren't you? Mommy will take you to the hospital right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah continued to cry, his small body twisting in discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> stood beside me, looking deeply at the baby in my arms. He </span><span>naturally </span><span>reached out and took Noah from me, holding him in his broad embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn&rsquo;t know why.</span><span> </span><span>Maybe </span><span>it was the magic of blood ties or the security of a man's arms, the moment </span><span>Elliott</span><span> held Noah, the baby's stopped</span><span> crying</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah opened his eyes, holding his tiny hands, and looked curiously at </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. The father and son shared a moment of deep eye contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I saw </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s eyes well up with tears, while Noah, looking at him, suddenly began to smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, </span><span>he's smiling! </span><span>Noah is smiling!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malina exclaimed in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Noah, then at </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. Their </span><span>very similar</span><span> faces looked so harmonious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It</span><span> was </span><span>his </span><span>first time holding </span><span>Noah</span><span>, </span><span>Elliott's </span><span>posture was still a bit clumsy and unnatural. </span><span>But</span><span> the genuine affection and the innate closeness of their blood bond felt truly magical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents initially wanted to stop </span><span>Elliott</span><span> from getting close to Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they saw the smile on Noah's face, they stood there awkwardly, saying nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah still has a high fever. We should take him to the hospital immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom </span><span>pushed us</span><span> anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't panic. It's raining outside, and going out now could make it worse. Madeline, get </span><span>some</span><span> warm water. Let's try to bring Noah's fever down with some physical cooling first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span>'s voice was </span><span>very</span><span> calm. His confident tone left no room for argument, and I found myself complying without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly fetched a basin of warm water. </span><span>Elliott</span><span> had already asked Malina to set the air conditioner in the nursery to 30 degrees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he laid Noah flat in the crib, took his temperature, and undressed him. I handed him a towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently wiped Noah's cheeks and neck with the small towel, then moved on to his armpits, back, and thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't sure if he had any medical training before, but he performed each step professionally and steadily, soothing Noah as he worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah usually acts like a little tyrant with </span><span>bad</span><span> temper. Even my parents and Malina together sometimes can't handle him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was like a well-behaved little doll, letting </span><span>Elliott</span><span> do whatever he wanted, just staring at the man with wide eyes, looking extremely </span><span>good</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents, for once, didn't say anything, just watched quietly from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I assisted </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. After he wiped Noah several times, he dressed him again and took his temperature. He sighed with relief:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His temperature is below </span><span>99</span><span>.5</span><span>&#8457; </span><span>now. He's fine for the moment. It's flu season and the rainy season, with too many viruses outside. It's better not to take Noah to the hospital unless absolutely necessary to avoid infection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, </span><span>Elliott</span><span> gently patted Noah's with his big hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This little guy usually takes my parents half an hour of walking around to get him to sleep, but with just a few gentle pats from </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, he fell asleep on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, incredulous:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know all this?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="910.html">« Prev</a><a href="912.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
