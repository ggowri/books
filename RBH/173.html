Even though it didn't result in a tragedy, it was still closely related to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Giselle's proud nature, she definitely couldn't accept it for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, then you advised her to drink less, girls shouldn't drink too much alcohol."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I symbolically expressed my concern with a sentence, and after understanding the situation, I immediately hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had not come back yet, and I was lying alone in the hospital, feeling really bored. So, I chatted with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was also at the bar tonight, and it seemed that he was in the VIP box upstairs at the bar. From his perspective, he could clearly capture the booth where Giselle was sitting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn occasionally shared a few live videos with me, and what shocked me was that Giselle, who was drunk, shamelessly collapsed in Rowan's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Giselle took the initiative to hook her shoulder onto Rowan's and even kissed him willingly. Such boldness is completely different from the serene and lovely Giselle that I had in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really wonder how Elliott would feel if he saw it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Elliott's mind, Giselle should have been a pure and flawless lily, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was thinking about this in my mind, and at that moment, Quinn directly made a video call. As soon as I answered, I heard Quinn saying:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I have a good show for you to watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn finished speaking, he turned the camera towards the location where Giselle was. And through the video he sent, I actually saw Elliott, dressed in a suit, appearing next to Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott grabbed Giselle's wrist directly and pulled her out of Rowan's arms. Then, he angrily said something to Rowan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had clearly drunk a lot of alcohol. She weakly leaned on Elliott, their intimate posture, making my heart feel like it was being forcefully torn apart by something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Elliott had been gone for so long, he had actually gone to find Giselle...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly felt a strange bitterness in my mouth, as if I had taken medicine abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, Rowan reached out to snatch Giselle from Elliott's hand, but was forcefully pushed by Elliott and fell onto the nearby chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott directly lifted Giselle up and slowly walked towards the exit of the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's camera recorded every step Elliott took with unparalleled clarity, while I watched Elliott's receding figure as he walked away with Giselle. My heart felt like it was being cut by a knife, the pain was excruciating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but yell at Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, why did you show me this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Quinn's face appeared in the camera, and in Quinn's eyes, he seemed very disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want you to see these either, but I thought that although the truth hurts, it helps people see reality more clearly. Madeline, I know I am cruel, but I just want to help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn finished saying this sentence, without waiting for me to say anything else, he hung up the phone directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay on the hospital bed, time slowly flowing by, while Quinn's words echoed in my mind. I increasingly felt that he was like a fog, and I had no idea what purpose lay hidden beneath this fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this moment, I had no time to think too much about Quinn's motives. My mind was filled with the scene of Elliott leaving with Giselle in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept telling myself over and over again not to care too much, telling myself that I no longer loved Elliott. But I have to admit, whenever he treated Giselle even a little bit better, I couldn't find peace within myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't stop my mind from generating all kinds of extremely bad associations, so inexplicably, I dialed Elliott's phone number...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="172.html">« Prev</a><a href="174.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
