I can almost hear the sound of countless women's hearts shattering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at those photos, presumably snapped by some tabloid paparazzi.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Elliott was once so arrogant. How could he possibly be seen carrying a woman in a crowded mall?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was, of course, front-page news for these journalists.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this meant that my face was clearly exposed. Even though the person filming was far away, my features were still distinctly visible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, I couldn't keep a low profile anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reading this news gave me a headache. Without a second thought, I shot Paige a message:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, quick, get someone to scrub this news off the net! Now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, however, sent a series of exaggerated emojis in response:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First off, spill the beans. How on earth did you and Elliott patch things up? Weren't we supposed to ride the single wave together?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sigh of frustration, I quickly typed back:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll explain it to you in person when I get a chance. Now, quickly, find someone to take down this news."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few seconds later, Paige shot back a reply:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone beat me to the punch; the news piece has already been taken down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily clicked on the link, only to find it had indeed been wiped out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seems like the PR team at Bryant Group did their magic, swiftly handling the news. However, a significant number of people have already caught wind of it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was wallowing in frustration when a message from Quinn popped up. There were no words, just a solitary, grey broken heart emoji.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This simple expression is giving me a hard time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he must have seen the news too. For a moment, I was at a loss for words, resorting to sending a string of ellipses his way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn never responded to me again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, I noticed he'd updated his social feed. It was a post featuring a pitch-black image, accompanied by a melancholic caption:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's a movie for three, yet I'm stuck playing the nameless extra.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this post on my social feed, I felt an even deeper pang of sadness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at our chat window for a long time, trying to find some words to comfort him. Yet, in the end, I didn't send anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I confess, I'm filled with guilt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Elliott hoisted me up and we began to navigate through the mall, my happiness was anything but feigned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn must have noticed it too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, people walk guided by their heads, other times, they follow their hearts. When led by the head, there's a semblance of control. But when the heart takes the lead, it's an uncontrollable force, a surrender to the irresistible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This weekend.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was decked out in the white tracksuit Elliott had bought for me, heading to the golf course Grey had recommended.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was splendid, the entire golf course was a lush expanse of green, offering a broad view that was absolutely refreshing and uplifting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I arrived on the scene, before Grey could even introduce me, someone immediately recognized me. He pointed at me and said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grey, is this lady the same one who was in the papers with Mr. Bryant yesterday? She looks familiar--"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, all eyes were on me, sparking an immediate flurry of conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It does seem likely, Grey. You don't suppose the new president of Bryant Group is her, do you? As far as I recall, didn't she divorce Mr. Bryant? Are they planning on getting back together?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant is quite aloof, isn't he? He rarely joins our gatherings. And to think he was spotted carrying a woman in the mall! He must be head over heels for her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hi there, I'm Sofia Dewin from Power Group."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there, I'm Milter Lelitin from Spark Media."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="885.html">« Prev</a><a href="887.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
