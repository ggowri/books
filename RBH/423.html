He immediately pointed ahead and said, "I live here. My apartment is 701. Madeline, what are you doing here? I've been living here for quite a while, and it's the first time I've bumped into you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a small world! My family just moved into apartment 801, right across from yours. It's hard to believe that we used to be classmates, and now we're neighbors. The world works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?" I said, my surprise turning into a warm smile as I patted his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? No wonder I haven't seen you before. That's great! Drop by my place sometime. I'm just about to head home and cook," Marcus replied, smiling as he lifted his shopping bag. I noticed it contained steaks, toast, and yogurt, among other things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he lived alone, opting for simple meals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm also heading out with my friend to buy groceries. My mom's cooking lunch. If you're up for it, come over later and join us. It'll be a chance to catch up." I suggested with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good! I'll come by later to visit Lily and Austin. It's been years since I've seen them," Marcus replied upon hearing that my parents also lived here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in high school, Marcus and a few of my close friends often came to my place for meals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother was always welcoming to my friends, so they felt right at home whenever they visited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My life might have taken a different path if I hadn't met Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, as they said, life had no "ifs".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I don't regret it. I suddenly realized that my world seemed to expand significantly when it wasn't just about Elliott anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still had so many genuine friends surrounding me, a feeling I hadn't experienced in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with Marcus briefly, Quinn and I headed to the supermarket together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn had already picked up on the dynamics between Marcus and me from our conversation. He jokingly remarked, "Wow, you two seem pretty close. Is he your first love?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled, "No, not quite. But we did have a little spark back in the day. It's just a pity he later joined the military."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? What's his name? He seems familiar." Quinn's gossip-loving nature immediately kicked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's Marcus Brown, the CEO of Tigress Pharmacy Company. We bumped into each other last time when he was discussing a project with Elliott," I explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tigress Pharmacy Company?" Quinn suddenly appeared pensive. After a few seconds, he continued, "That company has gained traction in the domestic market in recent years. I heard it's got some serious backing. I never would've guessed that the CEO was your classmate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Neither did I. You seem to know much about pharmaceutical companies, Quinn. You're full of surprises," I teased him playfully, then grabbed a cauliflower from the shelf and tossed it into the basket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn pushed the cart along as we continued to shop for groceries. He chuckled and said, "That's me, a walking encyclopedia. By the way, I've been out a few times recently, and I heard a new strain of flu going around in Catage that is quite contagious. With Christmas approaching and many people going out, it's probably best to stock up on masks, hand sanitizers, and the like. After all, Austin has just recovered."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="422.html">« Prev</a><a href="424.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
