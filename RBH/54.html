His gaze pierced through the crowd, and when it landed on Giselle, there was a hint of "a glance lasts forever" in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at each other from a distance like this, their gazes deeply captivated by each other. Giselle's eyes were sparkling, filled with the recklessness and innocence of someone who had just entered society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Elliott's eyes, besides confusion, there was clearly a faint and imperceptible glimmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He responded softly, his voice deep like a cello, magnetic and pleasant to the ear, saying a word worthy of many words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If no one can be found as a substitute, I am willing to perform on stage. I have learned to play the piano, and I can play... fairly well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was indeed brave. As a recent graduate intern, she volunteered herself in front of so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she clearly did not consult with anyone before volunteering herself, which startled her immediate supervisor Amy. Amy quickly grabbed her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, don't be silly. She is a heavyweight pianist in the country. How could you compare with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, however, was full of confidence. Her eyes did not move away from Elliott when they intertwined. She exclaimed loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I couldn't compare to Carli, I had also been practicing piano for many years. With the situation being so urgent now, I am willing to give it a try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had also been paying attention to this girl. I clearly saw that when Giselle said these words, there were clear traces of approval in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to want to say something. In the case of the last life, he must have agreed to Giselle's request to perform, thus giving the girl a chance to make a splash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this life, I had been secretly preparing for a long time. Just as he was about to speak, I interrupted him directly and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do the piano performance later. When I used to study piano before, I had received guidance from Carli for a period of time. She can be counted as my teacher. Since she can't attend, I'll perform in her place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I said these words, all the backstage staff turned their gaze towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Elliott's gaze, too, shifted from Giselle to me in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obviously didn't know that I could still play the piano, and his eyes were filled with doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and said, "Yes, there shouldn't be any problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely no problem. Madeline was a piano prodigy when she was young and had previously won awards internationally. When she takes the stage, there will be no doubt about her performance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, my best friend Paige appeared at the entrance of the backstage and she exclaimed loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's testimony reassured Elliott, and at this moment, the time for the performance was also approaching. Elliott immediately grabbed my hand and said in a deep voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, that's up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled slightly and said, "Don't worry. Let the host set the stage first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott made a decision, and everyone quickly went about their tasks, bustling around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath, adjusted my breathing, stood behind the scenes, and prepared for the upcoming performance.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="53.html">« Prev</a><a href="55.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
