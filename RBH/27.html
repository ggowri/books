Madeline, you have indeed grown a lot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice became even deeper than before, and it sounded like he was praising me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I knew this was not exactly a compliment. After all, how could he praise me when he despised me so much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be like this. It's just a small script. Recently, there was also a good project called Allure. Instead of wasting money on a small script, the Bryant Group would rather invest their energy in creating a big production."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to calm his inner anger, so I suggested to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have just been working for a few days, but you already know quite a lot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me coldly, scanning my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You used to always tell me to study hard, didn't you? I'm just following your words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately drew circles on his chest with my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I didn't understand the art of seducing men, in my previous life, I watched so many romantic dramas that I eventually learned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that a woman's act of being coquettish is somewhat effective, as the anger in his eyes disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Are you being so obedient now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled slightly, lifted my head, and playfully looked into his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, I deliberately dressed up, with light and elegant makeup, and my eyes were accentuated with eyeshadow and eyeliner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My eyes were very bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the past, I was constantly heartbroken because of Elliott, which caused my eyes to lose their sparkle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I have moved on, and my eyes have regained their natural brightness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment when I locked eyes with Elliott, I could feel a flash of brightness swiftly pass through his eyes, and at the same time, his hand around my waist unconsciously tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightly embraced my waist, creating a very ambiguous posture between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly realized that recently we seemed to have a lot more physical contact than in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was determined to get that drama. You can break the contract with Jacob, and I will pay the penalty for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to have taken a step back but was still domineering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has always been like this. Whatever he set his sights on, he must get it. He would never give up if anyone took it away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I was also determined to win this drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, I had already succeeded. I also couldn't compromise so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling, could you just let me have this project? Could you please stop fighting with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to do it a different way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to make him give up, I intentionally hooked my hand around his neck and imitated Sylvia's tone, starting to act coquettishly towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at the moment when I touched his neck, I distinctly felt a slight tremor in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me with a half-smile. He used to be so cold to me in the past, but I didn't know why he was unusually patient tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can give you anything else, but I won't compromise on work. Moreover, what I have always detested the most is people scheming with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly meant that he did not want to make any concessions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but feel a little annoyed, so I withdrew my hand and pretended to be angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bryant Group had so many projects. You didn't even need this small one. Your purpose in doing this was just for Sylvia, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if I am? Are you jealous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because I know your intention, therefore, it is even more impossible for me to give you this project. Elliott, we have no need to discuss it!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="26.html">« Prev</a><a href="28.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
