Do you remember one time the three of us ran into each other at a cocktail party, and we went up to him and told him we were Madeline's girlfriends, and he just gave us a little nod and turned away.

If you don't spend money, there are other women who will want to spend money. If he really cares about you, he will do whatever it takes, why would he put this money in his eyes. Besides, a woman is meant to be able to spend a man's money, and the more you spend, the more valuable he'll think you are and the less he'll be able to leave you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona also didn't know where she learned it from, and directly preached to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I understand.

He treated you so badly in the first place and you still want to marry him? He's treating you like an alternative! How come you're so clear</span><span>-</span><span>headed when it comes to other people's affairs, but when it's your turn, you're so confused?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige instantly exploded when she heard that, and she immediately growled at Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Yeah, Fiona, you need to think this through. Your first love has been dragging you down for so many years, and now he's coming back to marry you, does he have pure intentions?

I gave him my first time, and now that he's willing to turn back, I think I'll stay with him, I've decided!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona is a lot like me in some ways; we're both the kind of people who turn stubborn once we get an idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, we both even agree on our outlook on relationships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason I was obsessed with Elliott in the first place, and I've had nothing but him in my heart for so many years, is because I've always wished that I could be unwavering with him as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fiona, when you say Madeline is relationship</span><span>-</span><span>brained, aren't you?
