Her father used to be Elliott's father's driver, and her elder brother was now Elliott's driver. Moreover, the Bryant family sponsored her education.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder she could learn piano for many years although she came from an average family. It turned out that she had the support of the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, everything could be explained...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder in the previous life, she got close to Elliott so quickly, and later even Elliott's parents treated her better and better. It turned out it was because of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood beside them silently, listening to their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what she said, Elliott said, "The Bryant family should thank your father. Back then, your father lost his life while trying to save my father. My father feels guilty about this all the time. I didn't know it when you joined the Bryant Group. You could have had your brother contact me, and I could have arranged a better position for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott revealed more reasons, and this one added to my surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Giselle's father, who used to be Jasper's driver, lost his life while trying to save Jasper... This connection really surprised me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just graduated and need to gain more experience. I am doing well in the Planning Department, and Ms. Swift has been very supportive of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle smiled again. Her smile was pure and captivating, cheering people up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott continued to talk to her, asking about her family and study. The two of them had a good chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't seen Elliott care about someone for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He not only patiently chatted with her. Moreover, he took a banana, peeled it, and handed it to Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the whole process, he never noticed that Quinn and I were also in the ward as if we were just the background for their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their conversation was all about their past connection, which had nothing to do with us. We could only stand by silently and listen. But the more I listened to their conversation, the more upset I felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this destiny?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people were destined to be together. Fate couldn't be changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard I tried to break them apart and stop them from meeting each other with various methods, it would all be in vain in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle showed up in front of Elliott and even saved Elliott's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Elliott would definitely take special care of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what could I say about all of this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing. I could say or do nothing, which was suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Forget it. I will just leave them alone. I don't want to stay here and embarrass myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I silently left the ward. Elliott didn't even notice that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn came out with me as well, silently walking with me to the entrance of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already late. There was a crescent moon hanging in the sky. The sky was as dark as ink. The silent darkness gloomed the entire city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn patted my shoulder and said, "If you want, I can drink with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," I replied with waning enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn shook his head, gesturing for me to follow him into the car. He drove me all the way to his club, got a VIP room, and led me in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bottle of champagne is part of my collection. I bought it from an auction. Let's drink it tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out a limited edition expensive champagne from his private wine cabinet, took two champagne glasses, and opened the champagne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Woods, since when have you been so generous to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but ask with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look upset. I have no choice but to cheer you up with the luxurious champagne!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="59.html">« Prev</a><a href="61.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
