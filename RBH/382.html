Her previous kindness to me was just hope for my ability to bear children and continue the family line.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding my fiery face, I looked at Laura, then at Elliott, and couldn't help but bite my lip and let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to just realize that I was also in the hospital. After a brief shock, he rushed forward, shielding me behind him, and shouted at Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too late... At the moment everything happened, if he really cared about me, he should have rushed over, shouldn't he?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I forcefully shook off his hand, unable to bear such a huge humiliation anymore, turned around, and quickly ran outside...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How ironic everything was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Elliott and I were a loving couple.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in an instant, it seemed like a galaxy separated us, turning us into completely different people in two different worlds.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rushed out of the gates of Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a thunderstorm started outside, with lightning and thunder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to stay at this place for another moment, so without hesitation, I rushed into the rain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ran aimlessly in the rain, merciless raindrops hitting my face and body. As I ran, suddenly a big hand forcefully grabbed me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, a suit covered my head. Before I could react, I was lifted waist-high by the other person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the downpour, I saw that it was Elliott holding me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively started struggling. However, in the end, he held and pulled me, stuffing me into the car I had driven.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With lightning, a loud thunderclap rang out, the sound immense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was soaked, shivering uncontrollably. Elliott was also thoroughly drenched.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're upset, but no matter how upset, don't play with your health."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed a blanket from the car, quickly drying my hair and face, then wrapped me in the blanket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, teeth chattering, the car's heating barely helping.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew it was more heart-chilling than body-chilling. I bit my lip, trembling as I asked him, "So, can you tell me the truth now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He naturally knew what I meant, looking at me with a hint of darkness in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been telling the truth. As for that photo and the origin of the child, I'll investigate. Give me some time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still lying to me, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but growl softly, my body trembling more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me shivering, thinking I was cold, he immediately wrapped me in his arms. His tone was still firm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not lying to you. Give me time to investigate thoroughly, Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was that so?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he really not lying to me? Or was he liking his mother, saying one thing but meaning another?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't tell anymore, feeling like if this continued, my heart would be torn apart. I didn't know what to trust anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed him away forcefully. I didn't want to continue being immersed in the warmth he offered in such a confused state.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enough, really enough... Why should I be led by him and Giselle like this?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still had many more important things to do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately distanced myself from Elliott. I looked at him, my gaze cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll give you time to investigate. But until everything between you and Giselle is clear, don't touch me again, and don't look for me, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sinking of the past few days had gradually lost me in his desires.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rationality and self that I had painstakingly built before were almost destroyed by his madness.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="381.html">« Prev</a><a href="383.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
