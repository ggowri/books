I also didn't have the desire to meet any true love like you thought. I feel that we can try to start over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott finished speaking, he held me even tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His embrace was indeed spacious, and, without any obstacles, he held me tightly, our bodies pressed against each other. I could fully feel the warmth of his chest and the strong beating of his heart inside his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an embrace was very genuine, and the genuine feeling often made one's heart flutter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high wall that I had built in my heart suddenly loosened a bit, because I knew that Elliott, being so proud, rarely wanted to make such a compromise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that, compared to the past, he has started to care about me... and this is definitely a good sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't I once hope to break apart the love between him and Giselle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he compromised willingly and now we cannot divorce, why should I not agree?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, but how do we start over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed without realizing it, and at that moment, I instinctively reached out and wrapped my arms around his waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My actions made him tremble for a moment, and he suddenly lowered his head, and then planted a light kiss on my forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would change, it's getting late, let's go to sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He resumed his usual aloofness, unwilling to say too much about anything, summarizing his attitude in just a few words.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="151.html">« Prev</a><a href="153.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
