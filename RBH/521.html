"Are you Madeline from Glory Group? I've heard about you recently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah." I nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole nodded in return and then pulled up a nearby chair. Perhaps out of gratitude, her tone towards me became much friendlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for calling me so that I found out he was here. Otherwise, my mom would have had a heart attack. This jerk, couldn't he just stay home for Christmas? Instead, he's running off to places like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are friends, and I was worried that you would be worried if you couldn't contact him, so I tried my best to find your contact information," I smiled slightly and then said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You shouldn't have told this firecracker. Her coming only makes things messier," Quinn joked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Quinn's remark, Carole immediately widened her eyes in anger. Afraid they might start arguing again, I quickly interjected, "Okay, Quinn, tone it down! Carole cares about you. You should appreciate that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he's always been heartless, you know? He's been getting on my nerves since we were kids. When he's healed, I'm going to give him a piece of my mind," Carole said, glaring at Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she abruptly turned to Oliver and David, who had been standing in the room and hadn't left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "So, the director and the doctor are here too, huh? How's my brother doing now? Is his condition serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Carole stepped in, Oliver and David were struck by her formidable presence. They remained silent until Carole initiated the conversation. They stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>David spoke first, "Ms. Woods, hello, I'm your brother's attending physician. He currently has several external injuries, with the abdominal injury being slightly more severe, but fortunately, it hasn't affected his internal organs. Once it scabs over, he should be fine. However, he's running a high fever right now, and we just had a disagreement with Ms. Mayers about how to treat this issue. Your timing is perfect. As Mr. Woods' sister, we'd like to hear your opinion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole immediately said, "What disagreement? Please, tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go first," I said, fearing David's words might influence Carole's judgment. "Carole, as you know, this virus has been defined by experts as a new strain. Hospitals are overflowing with patients, and conventional antibiotic treatments haven't shown significant efficacy so far. Therefore, I don't recommend using antibiotics to treat Quinn. I have a newly developed drug here that's highly effective against this virus. My colleagues and I have all recovered by taking it. I don't want Quinn to undergo antibiotic treatment. I'd rather have him take this drug. However, Dr. Muller and Dr. Thomas are concerned that the new drug might be ineffective and could delay treatment, so we're at odds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to explain the situation as succinctly as possible, hoping Carole would support me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to my surprise, Carole became displeased immediately after hearing my explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the doctors think that new drug is too risky, I'm not about to gamble with my brother's health! Doctors, just scrap the regular antibiotics. Get him the top-notch stuff to bring down his fever pronto!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole's words stunned me. I was about to intervene when Quinn, lying on the bed, suddenly spoke up.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="520.html">« Prev</a><a href="522.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
