But I never expected that he actually had such a profound side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I never realized before, but you actually have some culture."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was extremely surprised. So, I couldn't help but blurt it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slapped my head hard. Then, he said helplessly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what do you mean by this? After all, I am a graduate of a top-tier institution, you know? In terms of education, I am not inferior to Elliott, whom you love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn? Graduated from a top university?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared wide-eyed in astonishment. I was somewhat incredulous:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is what you said true? How come I've never heard you mention it before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's there to boast about? I used to be an excellent student too. It's just that I wasn't as flashy as Elliott. I didn't enjoy doing business; I preferred living freely and unrestrained."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled slightly. He blinked his eyes at me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I only knew a few people who surrounded Elliott, and they were all wealthy second-generation individuals. But I never took the time to learn about their experiences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for my deep interaction with Quinn nowadays, I wouldn't have thought that he also has many unknown sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This suddenly enlightened me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, there were more than just Elliott as excellent men in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why should I, just like in the past, have such narrow-mindedness? Why should I only identify with one Elliott?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn is right. As long as I do well on my own, I will definitely meet someone better and more deserving in the future. Perhaps I will even find the love that I desire and hope for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, although you can be quite unserious at times, I still appreciate your words today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him and expressed my approval for him for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He burst into laughter. His smile became even more radiant, like the warm sun. He said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's good if you can open up. Come on, take off your shoes, I'll take you to play in the water. Forget about all the unhappiness today, tomorrow will be a new day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was indeed very good at playing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his instigation, I actually took off my shoes. Afterward, I ran to the seaside with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He poured seawater on me recklessly. I was not willing to accept it. So, I fought back desperately. We played like this by the seaside. Later, he took me to try beach motocross and surfing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dormant pleasure cells inside my body were easily activated by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, I also enjoyed extreme sports. Under Quinn's guidance, I once again experienced the joy of pushing my limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, I drowned in the sea. Therefore, I had a fear of the ocean deep within me. But that fear was completely dispelled by Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt as if I suddenly became young and energetic. And all the unhappiness in my heart was completely thrown into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We played crazily by the seaside like children. It was not until the sky gradually turned dark that we finally put away our playful nature and left the beach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn took me back to my parents' house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He draped his only towel from his car over me. Just as I was getting out of the car, he called out to me. Suddenly, he said to me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, if this marriage truly made you so unhappy, then you should have divorced earlier. There will be better people waiting for you in the future. Trust me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="68.html">« Prev</a><a href="70.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
