How is this going? Don't tell me the child in her belly is Elliott's. Oh my gosh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put my hands on my chest as if I was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was dragged by me and couldn't leave. Her face turned even paler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only deny it reluctantly, "No, they may have heard wrongly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't divorced Elliott yet, so Laura didn't dare to tell the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, I suddenly felt that the grievances I had been bearing were finally vented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? What about her kid? Whose child is she pregnant with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lady asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the lady subconsciously. She was wearing a white dress, a pearl necklace, and a Cartier watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that I didn't know her, but I felt like she was a very kind and elegant lady for some reason, and she was also a little familiar to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to be deliberately speaking for me, which made me feel good about her. I met her eyes and felt that she was very friendly to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being questioned, Laura was no longer arrogant. She stood listlessly among the crowd without saying a word. It was obvious that she hadn't found a chance to get out of her predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was holding her belly, with tears filled in her eyes, because Laura denied her identity. I believe she must feel aggrieved now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed she was clenching her hands tightly, and tears falling from her face. Just when I thought she would do nothing, she suddenly choked and said, "Laura, I have been pregnant for so long, don't you dare to tell everyone the truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Giselle said this, Laura shivered. Laura immediately raised her head and glanced sharply at Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, she was a very vain person, so of course she did not want Giselle to expose the scandal of the Bryant family here today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was a grand gathering of the upper class in Hoswich. Today there were not only entrepreneurs in Hoswich who attended the party but their wives...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Laura who was aggrieved at this moment, I felt happy to watch this happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to be extremely surprised again and shouted, "Giselle, what are you talking about? What truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if she could not bear it anymore, Giselle suddenly became emotional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried and shouted, "Madeline, it's enough! Stop pretending! You know everything! "</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="453.html">« Prev</a><a href="455.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
