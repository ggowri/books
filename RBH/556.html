Perhaps because he drank too much last night, he looked a little haggard now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached, I heard their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I've caused you trouble again. You even have to hold me here to do a B-ultrasound. The doctor said that I cannot walk now. If I bleed again, it will be difficult to save the child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you walk by yourself after I carry you to the door?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you have to keep holding me. When it's my turn, you should carry me into the room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's hands hooked Elliott's neck. Her shy look and soft voice made me particularly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned tightly and walked to us with Giselle in her arms. Perhaps he sensed someone in front of him, so he looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he realized that I was standing in front of him, he looked panicked. Then, he loosened his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Giselle fell off his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle exclaimed. Fortunately, Laura reacted quickly and rushed over to protect Giselle, so Giselle didn't fall to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what happened?" Giselle held Elliott's clothes tightly. After finally standing still, she asked in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott stood there as if he was under a spell, staring at me without blinking. He said nothing, and his face showed no emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, why don't you be more careful? She is fragile now. You must pay attention to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was supporting Giselle while blaming Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was impressed that she tried to please both me and Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige saw Elliott was holding Giselle in his arms and became angry. She wanted to curse, but I grabbed her hand in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no point in scolding him or saying anything now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would only make everyone tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was tired of arguing with Elliott. We were strangers now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave him a cold look and kept silent. Then, I pulled Paige, and walked by him, wanting to quickly leave this embarrassing and suffocating place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as I passed him, he suddenly grabbed my sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned and turned to look at him. And he lowered his head and looked sad. But in an instant, he suddenly looked indifferent and cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he wanted to say something to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't say anything but let me go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. I'll take you to do a B-ultrasound. No matter what, our baby has to be safe."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="555.html">« Prev</a><a href="557.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
