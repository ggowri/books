With the emergence of the new influenza virus, a drug called "anti-flu capsule" stood out from many other antiviral drugs because it was able to contain the spread of the epidemic in time, and it became a blessing for many patients with the new influenza virus.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, the patent for this drug was in the hands of my old friend Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in my last life, I was not well-informed and did not know anything about it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that in order to save the current loss and increase the revenue for the Glory Group, we had to do something to obtain the cooperation with Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if I did that, wouldn't I be stealing Elliott's client from him again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was furious when I quietly bought the rights to "Do Not Love" last time, so I secretly adopted "Allure" to get back this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this occasion, if I stole Marcus, a big customer, from Elliott again, would he think I was unrighteous?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one hand on my chin, I was listening to Marcus's subordinate Landen's explanation of this drug, while silently calculating in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of the vast market prospects this drug would have in the near future filled me with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously glanced at Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat attentively in the main seat, staring intently at the screen and listening carefully to Landen's presentation. From the look on his face, I couldn't tell whether he was interested in the drug or not.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would wait and see what would happen first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the narration ended as Landen made a final summary of the proposal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned to look at Elliott and asked with a smile, "Mr. Bryant, what do you think after listening to our presentation?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled, his face showing the composure and arrogance of a business magnate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In terms of efficacy, this drug seems to be quite good. There are various drugs used for antiviral in the market currently, and they all cost less than developing this drug, and all have higher market awareness than it. Mr. Brown, what do you think about this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Elliott was a businessman who had been involved in the business field for many years, as he could immediately tell what the problem was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned slightly, "Mr. Bryant, you're right. To be honest, that's also what worries me about this drug. However, as we compared other antiviral drugs of the same type on the market, we eventually found that this drug has the most stable efficacy and controls the disease the fastest. If it can be developed, it will definitely be a good medicine that can benefit people."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Marcus had been in the military, so his words sounded extremely sincere. When Elliott asked him that, he just told him bluntly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Elliott again. Honestly, I was hoping he would just politely refuse Marcus. If that had happened, I could have just taken the drug.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott was as experienced as a fox in the commercial world. He neither rejected on the spot nor gave a direct reply, but said, "Alright, we can do that. Mr. Brown, you can just leave the information and we'll explore and evaluate it internally and get back to you, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, we'll look forward to hearing from you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Marcus readily agreed.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="356.html">« Prev</a><a href="358.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
