Even when Paige wanted to come and see me, she refused to tell her my ward number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed quickly, and before I knew it, the day of my discharge arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After completing all the necessary checks, Fiona processed my discharge procedures. The catheter in my hand was finally removed, and I was finally able to take off the hospital gown and put on my own clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing outside the hospital gate, I suddenly felt that the air was exceptionally fresh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave Fiona a big hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These days, you have really worked hard, my dear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't mention these, just remember to treat me to a big meal when the TV series you invested in becomes popular."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona smiled and patted my shoulder, teasing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, if this drama becomes popular, not to mention a fancy meal, I will invite you and Paige to travel abroad together and arrange handsome foreign guys for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It had to be the kind that was over 6ft tall, and, not just one, but a group surrounding us, hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was shaking with laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, beneath Fiona's serious appearance, there was a very open heart, but usually, she hid it very well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was amused by Fiona's greediness, and after teasing each other, we bid farewell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't have anyone come to pick me up because, apart from Elliott and a few friends, my parents had no idea about my injury this time, and I specifically instructed Elliott not to tell them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents are already old. In the previous life, there were too many things that made them worry about me. In this life, I want to minimize their worries as much as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I planned to go to Louis City, my first stop after being discharged was to go straight to my parents' house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to go home and explain the situation to my parents, and also pack a few clothes, and then just head straight to Louis City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a taxi back to the doorstep of my house. As I pushed open the door, I saw my mom standing in the yard, wearing a knitted sweater and a floral long skirt, carefully tending to her plants and flowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shouted loudly and then immediately rushed towards my mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom was suddenly startled by my shout, and she was so excited that she almost dropped the flowerpot in her hand. She quickly hugged me tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how come you had time to come back today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I missed you, Mom. My drama has started filming, so I plan to stay in Louis City for a while. It's closer and more convenient for me to manage. I'll pack a few clothes and have a meal with you before I leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hugged my mom's arm and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to my surprise, before my mom could reply, my dad's voice suddenly drifted from the other corner of the yard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you going to stay in Louis City for a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Dad, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively turned my head and was about to talk to my dad when suddenly I saw Elliott's aloof face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart skipped a beat, I was extremely shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that Elliott was at my house, and he was even playing chess with my dad in the yard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't he usually very busy? Why is he interested today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was extremely surprised, my mouth opened wide, and I couldn't speak for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott has been playing chess with your dad these days. He told us that you have been busy lately and didn't have time to come back and be with us, so he took the time to come and spend more time with us. How come he didn't tell you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother saw me so surprised, and she quickly smiled and said, "Ha-ha."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="179.html">« Prev</a><a href="181.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
