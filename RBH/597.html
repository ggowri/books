No matter how we tried to persuade you in the past, you were steadfast in your love for him. Moreover, you're carrying his child now... Aren't you afraid that once he knows the truth, he'll come looking for you again?" Paige spoke seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her point happened to be precisely what was worrying me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially today in Elliott's office, he had already begun to suspect that the child in my belly was likely his. Given his nature, once he harbored doubts, Elliott would undoubtedly seek the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "If one day he finds out the truth and wants to take the child from me, what should I do then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I placed my hand on my slightly protruding belly. As if sensing my touch, the baby inside moved several times in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, the movements had been subtle, like a small fish swimming in my belly. However, this time, the baby's movements were unusually strong and forceful, as if telling me that he didn't want to be separated from me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Regardless, I can't let Elliott or the Bryant family know that the baby in my belly carries their genes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Hoswich, with the Bryant family's connections and Elliott's resources, it seems unlikely that this secret can be kept hidden indefinitely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It appears that once the baby is safely born, I will have to think of another way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained silent for a long time, not responding to Paige's words. Seeing me lost in thought, she nudged my arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you thinking about? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing, just a bit muddled in my thoughts. Let's go, I'll take you back. Oh, you mentioned feeling unwell earlier. Do you still need to get checked?" I asked Paige quickly, snapping back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My feeling unwell was just an excuse. Otherwise, Philip wouldn't have let me come out with you. He's been on edge lately, following me everywhere, and constantly warning me not to meet you or Fiona alone. Do you think he's being overly caring or going crazy?" Paige complained as we walked towards the parking area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but glance at her. Observing her innocent appearance, I almost told Paige about what I had seen on the yacht, but looking at her pregnant belly, I decided against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does Philip still go to nightclubs often?" I asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Occasionally. Most of the time, he's at home playing video games, saying it's to keep me company," Paige said, with a hint of satisfaction in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "She is deeply in love with Philip after all... Perhaps when a woman decides to spend her life with a man, she can't help but love him even more deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't that how I felt in the beginning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, at least he's staying home to be with you. But he does like going to nightclubs. If he goes in the future, it's best for you to go with him," I couldn't help but advise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paige didn't seem to take my words seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "There's no need. I used to stay out all night at the clubs without any problems. Now, I'm ready to sleep by ten. Since I got pregnant, I'm so tired, I don't have the energy to worry about him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men are sometimes like children. If you're careless, they're more likely to make mistakes. Paige, you'd better..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I started to warn, but before I could finish, I suddenly saw someone approaching us from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her appearance instantly ignited my anger.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="596.html">« Prev</a><a href="598.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
