Why did Elliott suddenly want to talk to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With doubts lingering in my mind, I was pulled all the way from the hospital corridor to the back seat of his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shut the car door. Before I could react, he pulled me into his arms, his tone unusually soft as he apologized, "I'm sorry for what happened today. It was entirely unexpected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he had something to say to me when he dragged me into the car. But now, was he trying to make me submit again with this approach?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of inexplicable anger surged within me. I pushed him away with all my might and glared at him with bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, mind your actions. It disgusts me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, I resisted him intensely, even though he still looked like the same Elliott I used to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything that had happened, the trust I had painstakingly built up for him had returned to square one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found it hard to believe anything he said and didn't want any physical contact with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must have felt the resistance emanating from me. His gaze held a hint of pain as he looked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believed that we had developed enough of a bond during this time. Could this bond be so easily shattered by someone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bond?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled coldly, deliberately retreating to the side of the car door, wanting to maintain as much safety distance as possible from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You talk about having a bond with me after having a child with another woman. Don't you find that ridiculous? Is it because you think I can't bear children, so you want to force me to accept your child? Or are you planning to drive me away before they're born?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I questioned coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shifted forward slightly. He reached out and gently tucked my somewhat disheveled hair behind my ear, his eyes full of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The child indeed came unexpectedly. I have thought back repeatedly, and nothing happened between me and her at Dikio that night. I have no reason to deceive you," he insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He desperately tried to prove his innocence, forcing me to look up at him. So I did, but with mockery written all over my gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it simple to prove that the child's not yours? You just took her for a paternity test. So, what were the results?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he would provide me with an answer honestly, but his eyes flickered for a moment, and then he lowered his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I asked to speak with you alone to discuss this matter," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor betrayed a sense of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart raced, and my voice turned sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well? Have the results of the child's paternity test come back? Or did you never take her for examination in the first place?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="400.html">« Prev</a><a href="402.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
