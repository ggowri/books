"Madeline, I heard that you are going to Norch City by plane? Have you already left? Can you cancel this plan? I don't recommend you going to Norch City right now, as the situation at the border there is a bit chaotic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. We won't go near the border. We'll just visit a few well-known tourist spots. Besides, all the executives from my company are going together, and we'll have a local guide with us. There won't be any problems," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, I also took a look at the news about Norch City. What Quinn said about the border being a bit chaotic, I also saw the relevant news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a gunfight and riot happening in the warlord-controlled area of Mexico, but such things were already a daily occurrence in Mexico and did not affect our country, so I wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really want to go, then I'll go with you too. I'll book a flight now, and we can meet in Norch City when the time comes," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn already understood my personality and knew that once I made a decision, no one could stop me. So, he suddenly decided to go to Norch City together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, it's alright, you can focus on your own tasks. I have plenty of people here with me, Marcus and Adam are both by my side, so don't worry." However, I couldn't bear to accept his kindness any longer, and I quickly declined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you are in the late stage of pregnancy now, with such a big belly. I am not very reassured if I am not by your side. Madeline, just wait for me in Norch City," Quinn insisted, still wearing that anxious look of wanting to protect me. No matter what I said, he was determined to book a plane ticket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to say something else, but he had already hung up the phone in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was somewhat speechless, knowing that it was useless to persuade him. So, I </span><span>decided not to say anything more and watched as the boarding process had already begun. Therefore, I entered the cabin along with everyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this trip, Adam booked business class for the others, but considering my bulky physique, he specially reserved a first-class ticket for me to ensure that I could rest well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I boarded the plane, Adam specifically briefed the flight attendants about my special situation. As a result, they took extra care of me, personally escorting me to my seat, fastening my seatbelt, and even thoughtfully providing me with a blanket and an eye mask for a comfortable rest during the journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The biggest feeling in the late stage of pregnancy is easily getting tired. I had just sat down on the seat, and immediately felt a wave of drowsiness coming over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put on the eye mask and soon felt drowsy. Just as I was about to fall asleep, I faintly smelled a familiar perfume scent. Then, I heard the flight attendant say, "Sir, please move a little slower. This lady is pregnant. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="720.html">« Prev</a><a href="722.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
