He immediately took off his coat and put it on me, under the gaze of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. If we don't go back soon, you will catch a cold," he urged once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was very similar to the tone I used to beg him to come home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we first got married, he would always spend his time at various nightclubs with his friends. I was worried that he would get drunk, so I would go from one nightclub to another to find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew he didn't like me appearing in front of him, but I kept appearing in front of him time and time again, pleading with him to come home with me early using various excuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he was very arrogant and didn't care about me. On the contrary, he found me annoying. Sometimes, when he couldn't convince me to go home, he would leave with a stern face and go to another nightclub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things are different now. I used to go to nightclubs, but he begged me to come home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Let's go," I agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, I bid farewell to everyone and walked out of the compartment with him, carrying my bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew how it felt to be rejected in public, so I didn't embarrass him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were still a couple now, and we hadn't reached the point of embarrassing each other yet. Maintaining harmony and avoiding arguments is what I hope for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, my biggest enemy was Giselle. Elliott and I had plenty of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott held my hand all the time. He led me through a long corridor, entered the elevator, and walked out of the lobby. After getting into his car, he let go of my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You became more and more excessive. Why were you with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting in the car, he frowned and looked at me, seeming very displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't spend time with unfamiliar men. They were your friends and mine. Don't you allow me to do so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched him with a smile on my face. I didn't know when it started, but I no longer felt scared when facing him, instead, I felt calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to be with a man you don't know? Madeline, I think you wouldn't dare to do that. You'd better not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pretended to be angry and harshly flicked my forehead. The warning in his tone was very clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found it funny and teased, "It seems like you are starting to care more about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rolled his eyes at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be proud."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, to be honest, are you starting to care about me more and more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, I didn't even dare to think about joking with him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I no longer care about him as much, so I don't think about whether my words will anger him. I say whatever I want to say. I easily say a lot of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know if I was right or not, he didn't refute me, and suddenly changed the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents found out that you accompanied me to receive the Dikio VIP group. They were very happy. My mom told us that we would have dinner at home tomorrow."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="108.html">« Prev</a><a href="110.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
