What's wrong, Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam could tell from my tone that I was a bit impatient, so he quickly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we arrive in Hoswich, I won't go home right away. Instead, please drop me off at the International Exhibition Center in Hoswich. I have something to attend to there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said to Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Madeline, what were you doing there? I heard they were setting up an exhibition there. I saw on Giselle's Instagram that she was there overseeing it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam mentioned Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything matched up in an instant, that thing from the previous life happened today, there is no mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, due to the sudden heavy rain, the greenhouse built by the construction team of Bryant Group for this exhibition had quality issues and almost collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, it was Giselle who discovered the safety hazards in the greenhouse during her on-site inspection. Subsequently, under her strong demand, the construction party demolished the hazardous greenhouse overnight and rebuilt it. However, Giselle, due to her on-site supervision, was accidentally injured by a falling crossbeam and was rushed to the hospital overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's careful and diligent work ensured the timely elimination of potential hazards for this exhibition. The construction team ensured the quality of the project, preventing any accidents on the day of the exhibition and saving Bryant Group from possible significant losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incident alarmed the senior management of Bryant Group, and upon learning all the details, Elliott immediately rushed to the hospital to visit Giselle. It was this incident that caused Elliott's feelings for Giselle to quickly intensify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott increasingly felt that Giselle was extraordinary, so he not only treated her better and better, but also promoted her directly to be his personal assistant. Since then, he unabashedly appeared with Giselle on various public occasions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, I argued with him, quarreled with him, and even brought this matter to Elliott's parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the end result was that I brought shame upon myself. Elliott's parents increasingly felt that I was not mature enough, and my every move was nothing like what a wealthy family's daughter should be. And Elliott grew even more disgusted with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply moved out of Serenity Villa and into another apartment, and soon there were rumors that Giselle would often come and go in that apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was sad and desperate at that time, but I had no other choice, so I had to hire a private detective to follow them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, I discovered that Elliott not only purchased a luxurious duplex apartment of 2,000 square feet for Giselle in that expensive apartment building, but also established a wedding planning company for their family in Nicole's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Giselle were not living together at that time, but the private detective captured them entering and leaving together, laughing and talking, on multiple occasions. Furthermore, the private detective even captured a moment of them embracing in the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when I took that photo to find Elliott, he tore it into pieces right in front of me. After that, he couldn't bear it anymore and asked for a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my second life, up until now, I still remember Elliott's cold and ruthless appearance that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His extremely cruel words, like a knife, deeply pierced into my heart, and when he admitted in front of me that Giselle was the love of his life, I couldn't even stand, and I fell to the ground directly, stumbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so cruel back then, his eyes only had Giselle in them. In his eyes, I was just a burden, something not even worth mentioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would even rather play with a dog than say a word to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even, he openly declared to everyone in the Bryant Group that I would be prohibited from entering the Bryant Building in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The things that happened in the past, which I now recall, still feel like a heart-wrenching pain.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="154.html">« Prev</a><a href="156.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
