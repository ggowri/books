You can buy them anywhere else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, you can find gemstone bracelets elsewhere, but one of this quality, a coveted antique no less, is one of a kind. I know you want it, but alas, you don't even have a ticket to the auction. Unless, of course, you apologize to Laura. Then, perhaps, I might consider it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa said with a sly grin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize? Why should I? I haven't done anything wrong. I was in a great mood today, until it was ruined by those two rabid dogs that came out of nowhere. Madeline, come with me. Let's deal with those annoying mutts at the door..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey, unwilling to continue the argument, grabbed my hand and led me towards the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Lisa Fox, she's no ordinary gal!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey sat on the chair by the door, speaking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let them get to you," I shook my head, saying, "Grey, they're just trying to rile you up. The best way to deal with them is to ignore them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. I'm going to make sure every friend in Hoswich City shuns her. Let's see how many tricks this illegitimate girl has up her sleeve, and if she can still survive in the social circles of Hoswich City."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey was still seething with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it, don't bother with them. Grey, you mentioned earlier, the kid from the Bryant family was sent to an orphanage? Which one?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like the name of that orphanage is Starlight. Why do you ask? Don't tell me you're taking pity on that kid."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel for that kid, you know. He was brought into this world by his mother, used like a tool, and now he's been abandoned... It's tough for a child with Down Syndrome to survive in this society."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but shake my head and let out a sigh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon unexpectedly learning of the child's whereabouts, I visited the orphanage over the weekend.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the kid was left behind by Giselle Cole, and I shouldn't feel any pity for him, I found my heart softening ever since I became a mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hauled a bunch of stuff over to the orphanage, all under the guise of donations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of the orphanage personally welcomed me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there, I encountered the kid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was incredibly skinny, looking malnourished. His peculiar features made him seem like an alien.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I scooped him up from the bed, played with him for a bit, and discovered that he too, could laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a girl, much like you, who's come to see him a few times before."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was amusing the kid when suddenly, the words of the principal hit me like a bolt from the blue.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="876.html">« Prev</a><a href="878.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
