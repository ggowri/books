Alright, I can tell you. My license plate number was..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was afraid that she would really torture Quinn, so I had no choice but to give her our license plate number over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I will have someone waiting for you at the highway intersection! I hope you better not play any tricks, because if I find out that you called the police or brought someone else along, it won't just be Quinn, you and your accomplice might not make it back alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman on the other end of the phone was shouting crazily, and her arrogant tone made me so angry that I couldn't help but yell into the phone, "Stop threatening me! Don't forget, it's a rule of law society now, and you can't get away with doing illegal things like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You talk to me about the rule of law!" the woman laughed on the other end of the phone. "The law may be useful in Hoswich City, but not necessarily here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, having said this, hung up the phone once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, from what she said, I realized that she seemed to be familiar with me. She not only knew that Quinn and I were good friends, but also knew that we came from Hoswich City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who is she exactly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doubts in my mind instantly surged up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, Jane raised her phone and said to me, "Ms. Mayers, I recorded a video of the scene when you just had a video call with her and sent it to Dehan. They told me that this place seems to be a mountain north of Ruini. They have already identified the location and sent soldiers to investigate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was very alert. She actually recorded all the scenes shown in the woman's video when I was just on the phone with her, and sent them to Dehan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! If Quinn was really found by them, then we wouldn't have to be threatened by them anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard her say this, and instantly, infinite hope rose in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, but Dehan still wants us to be careful. Now that they know our license plate number, they might send someone to follow our car once we get on the highway. If they see someone protecting us, it might raise their suspicion, so Dehan wants the car following us to maintain a distance. However, if we do that, the chances of encountering danger will increase. Fortunately, they have installed a GPS tracker on our car, so they will know exactly where we go!" Jane said to me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, now we were still an hour away from Ruini. Jane, I'm sorry for causing you trouble. You came out to relax, but now you have to accompany me in facing danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Jane and felt a little sorry in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane, on the other hand, said responsibly, "Ms. Mayers, don't say that. I actually feel honored to be able to accompany you. Others may not have such an opportunity. Besides, even if you don't let me come with you, I won't be able to rest assured, so I must come with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words made me slightly startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane, you were much braver than I thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane laughed and said, "Ms. Mayers, actually during the interview, there was an experience that I haven't mentioned to you yet. I used to be in the military before, I served for three years, and then I entered the pharmaceutical company after I was discharged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane used to be a soldier!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder she always had a different aura from other women. She was competent and quick-witted, never procrastinating in her actions. She possessed the same composure and calmness as Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, the temperament of a soldier is incomparable to that of an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately respected her and couldn't help but give her a thumbs up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Originally, there was such an outstanding woman by my side. You look so petite, I really didn't expect that you had served in the military before."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="733.html">« Prev</a><a href="735.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
