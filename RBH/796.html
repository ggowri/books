He was gazing at me with a gentle intensity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he saw me open my eyes, he affectionately pinched my cheek with his hand. He gave me a slight smile:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you recall what transpired last night?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My eyes blinked involuntarily. Memories of last night flooded over me like a tidal wave. A blush instantly spread across my entire face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I jolted upright from my bed in a rush. The moment I got up, my limbs still felt sore and heavy, but at least I could move:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did I end up here? How did I end up with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our home, where else should you be? What, you'd rather be at someone else's place?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott hoisted himself up beside me. He reached out, tucking my disheveled strands of hair behind my ear. His voice carried a hint of teasing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I initially wanted to tell him that we've been divorced for a while now, that this place is no longer my home. But then I remembered he's suffering from amnesia. So, I held my tongue and didn't utter those words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I'm not by your side, don't drink so much. The world is a complex place. You never know what others might be up to."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sidled up to me. He kneaded my shoulders, then whispered gently into my ear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh-huh."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About last night, I've got a ton of questions myself. So, I didn't say much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was wide awake now. Elliott's affectionate gesture left me feeling a bit out of place. So, I gently pushed him away, silently pulled back the covers, and got out of bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day had already broken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, the curtains were left undrawn, with only a sheer white veil covering the entire window. The morning light filtered softly through, casting a gentle glow. Subconsciously, I took in the familiar surroundings of the long-forgotten bridal suite.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, to my surprise, I found that a photo of Elliott and me had been deliberately enlarged and hung on the wall at some point.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only that, my old dressing table remains untouched. On it, my solo photo frame still stands. Even the bedding is the same four-piece set I personally picked out back in the day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing these familiar objects stirred something in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should I call him devoted or indifferent? Sometimes, it's really hard to pin a man down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A whirlwind of emotions swept over me. At that moment, Elliott stirred from his slumber. He wrapped his arms around my waist from behind, planting a gentle kiss on my cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading downstairs to whip up some breakfast for you. You can catch a few more winks, or, head up to the rooftop terrace for some fresh air. The flowers up there are in full bloom, quite a sight to behold."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rooftop Terrace?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, I used to nurture a myriad of plants and flowers. Before the divorce, I specifically instructed Sean to take good care of them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Elliott's words, a wave of nostalgia washed over me. So, after freshening up, I made a point to visit the rooftop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I pushed open the small door to the rooftop, the sight that greeted me was utterly astonishing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I discovered that each plant I used to nurture was not only meticulously cared for, but the landscape on the terrace had been redesigned, becoming more aesthetically pleasing than before. Every corner here exudes a sense of freshness and refinement, akin to a SkyPark, uplifting my mood extraordinarily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've mentioned before, I've had this dream of planting grapes and wisteria here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Elliott had a wooden trellis specially made. Grapevines and wisteria flowers twined around the overhead trellis, hanging down in long tendrils. When the wind blew, the place seemed exceptionally lush and verdant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to have a fondness for orchids. Now, I've set up a special rack dedicated to them. This rack is adorned with a variety of orchids, some of which have already bloomed, emitting an intoxicatingly subtle fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire garden was pristine, not a speck of dust in sight. From any angle, this patch of greenery seemed like it was plucked straight out of a fairy tale.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="795.html">« Prev</a><a href="797.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
