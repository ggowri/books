Because of its innovative plot and the outstanding looks and acting skills of the leading and supporting characters, the popularity of this drama on the internet completely exceeded my expectations, which greatly relieved me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect that the first drama invested by our Glory Group would have such high viewership. Ms. Madeline Mayers is truly amazing!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, she's the chairman's daughter after all, and she really has a keen eye for investment strategies..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, initially no one had high hopes, thinking that such a low-budget production wouldn't make much of a splash, but it turns out it's really impressive!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, but Ms. Jade Mayers' financial project hasn't been doing so well either. She was boasting about how high the return on investment would be, but now... it seems like it's going to fail."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shh, let's not discuss that matter anymore. I heard that the chairman is in a coma and might become a vegetable. Ms. Jade Mayers wants to seize power from Ms. Madeline Mayers. But she doesn't even consider that Ms. Madeline Mayers is the chairman's only legitimate daughter and rightful heir!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although that's true, Ms. Jade Mayers has been quite popular in Glory Group in recent years. If it weren't for Ms. Madeline Mayers suddenly emerging this year, that chairman position would have been hers sooner or later."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such rumors had spread throughout the entire Glory Group. Early in the morning, as soon as I entered the restroom, I overheard a few employees whispering and discussing recent events.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Jade's attempt to vie for power with me was no secret throughout the entire Glory Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I listened quietly for a while, then pushed open the restroom door and calmly walked out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The employees obviously didn't expect to find me in the restroom; they were startled, then scattered like mice encountering a cat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their reaction made me realize that I already had some authority in the Glory Group. However, I still couldn't feel happy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad was still in a coma. Although the doctors had tried to remove the blood clot from his head and he had been transferred from the intensive care unit to a regular ward, for some reason, he was still not woken up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom spent her days in tears, causing her to become emotionally exhausted, as if she had aged 10 years in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my dad and mom suffer like this, my heart couldn't help but ache.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't cry in front of anyone, but secretly, I had shed many tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But through the lessons of my previous life, I understood better than anyone else that even if my dad and mom had fallen, I absolutely couldn't give up, otherwise, I would only repeat the mistakes of the past life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, my first film and television project has already premiered, and the response has been great. When you wake up and see it, you'll definitely be proud of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I'm slowly establishing myself in the company now. Don't worry, with me around, I won't let Glory Group get into any trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, it's getting colder outside. I heard it's going to snow today. Can you open your eyes? I can take you to see it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since my dad was transferred to a regular ward, I had gotten used to sitting by his bedside every day, holding his hand and talking to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed so quickly. Unknowingly, this year was almost over. And in Hoswich, a city that hadn't seen snow in nearly ten years, there was now the rare sight of snowfall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wished that my mom and I, calling out to him day and night, could wake my dad up sooner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, my dad was still motionless in bed. I looked at him, tears streaming down my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a warm hand gently rested on my shoulder...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="308.html">« Prev</a><a href="310.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
