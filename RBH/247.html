Unconsciously, I ate a lot, even finishing a whole plate of spaghetti.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're also dining here! We could have shared a table."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar voice suddenly chimed in as we were nearing the end of our meal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't expected Fiona to be here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Fiona present, but Alexis was standing beside her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, they had just finished their meal upstairs and had coincidentally spotted us at the staircase, so they came over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona had clearly put effort into her appearance today, wearing a shirt dress paired with a cream-colored trench coat. Her figure was alluring, and her bobbed hair and shell earrings gave her a simple yet professional look. Her makeup was minimal, giving her a fresh and elegant appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing next to her, Alexis was slightly taller. He was still dressed in a suit, sporting gold-rimmed glasses, which added to his scholarly charm. Together, they looked especially well-matched.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you two on a date? If we shared a table, you wouldn't be able to have your private conversations," I teased, intentionally lightening the mood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, we just happened to run into each other and decided to grab a meal together. I'm not on a date with him, don't tease me, Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's face immediately blushed as she playfully pinched my cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis inquired with a smile, "Elliott, you seem have a good mood today, dining here with Mrs. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a gentleman, so my impression of him was still favorable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We went to visit Cormac in the hospital this morning, and this place is close by. Alexis, I heard your law firm has been doing well lately?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wiped his lips with a napkin, stood up, and greeted them with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've taken on several major international and domestic cases and won them all. My law firm is nearby. Would you like to come over for coffee?" Alexis suggested with a nod and a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott instinctively looked at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have some free time this afternoon, just need to check if Honey here is available."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott rarely addressed me so affectionately in front of them, and his sudden respect for me left both Alexis and Fiona visibly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in. I've never been to Alexis's law firm," I said to Fiona deliberately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, I had no desire to go, but for Fiona's sake, I had to go and assess Alexis' capabilities.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the four of us settled the bill and headed directly towards Alexis's law firm on foot.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="246.html">« Prev</a><a href="248.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
