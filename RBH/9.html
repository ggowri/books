We&#x27;re a match, aren&#x27;t we?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shut up!&quot; He said angrily.</p><p>&quot;Just leave me be. If you&#x27;re not up for a divorce, fine. But we&#x27;re doing our own thing from now,&quot; I said coolly.</p><p>It was the first time I stood up to him, in front of everyone.</p><p>It felt liberating. He couldn&#x27;t touch my mood anymore. I felt free and relieved.</p><p>Men were so selfish. They could mess around and stay out late, but a wife was supposed to just stay home and listen to him, even without winning his love.</p><p>&quot;First, you drug me, then you talk divorce, and now you accuse me of cheating?&quot;</p><p>Elliott sneered with overconfidence, thinking he had me figured out. He still thought I was just messing with him.</p><p>&quot;Think what you want,&quot; I said.</p><p>I was done talking to Elliott and instinctively tried to pull away from him.</p><p>However, he held my waist tightly, making me feel suffocated.</p><p>&quot;Go home! Now!&quot;</p><p>With a glare, Elliott gave another order. He was overbearing, which could make people tremble with fear.</p><p>If it were in the past, I would have been horrified and apologized.</p><p>But now, it didn&#x27;t work on me at all. I smiled indifferently and touched his chest.</p><p>&quot;You want me to go home? Okay. But you have to call Sylvia and ask her never to show up again.&quot;</p><p>I didn&#x27;t think Elliott would do that. I said that just to challenge him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as I finished speaking, he picked me up.</p><p>Before I could react, he carried me on his shoulders. Then, he walked out quickly with anger in front of the others!</p><p>Elliott took me straight to his limo.</p><p>This was my first time in it after six years of marriage.</p><p>He roughly pushed me into the back seat, glaring at me fiercely. I&#x27;d never seen him look so dark.</p><p>I tried to sit up, but he grabbed my neck and pinned me against the window, nearly crushing it.</p><p>&quot;Madeline, remember you&#x27;re Mrs. Bryant, my wife!&quot;</p><p>It was absurd. I never thought Elliott would play the &#x27;husband&#x27; card.</p><p>He hadn&#x27;t acted like a husband for years.</p><p>Now, just because I did something for myself, he wanted to trap me with this title.</p><p>How ironic!</p><p>I struggled to pry his hand open, and he finally let go. I caught my breath and glared at him.</p><p>&quot;Elliott, when have you ever treated me like your wife?&quot;</p><p>He shot back, &quot;Didn&#x27;t you always want to marry into the Bryants? You should appreciate it instead of flirting with others!&quot;</p><p>He looked down on me, a look I once adored but now found revolting. My love for him was dead; he just disgusted me.</p><p>&quot;Our marriage is just for show. It means nothing to me,&quot; I told him coldly.</p><p>I thought he might pick up on my detachment, but he was more arrogant than I expected. He grabbed my chin and touched my lips.</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;re asking for sex? Behave, and maybe I&#x27;ll consider it,&quot; he said coldly as if he was doing me a favor. </p><p>It was demoralizing. I didn&#x27;t care for him anymore; my heart was steady.</p><p>&quot;No thanks. I can find someone else. Anyone I want, whenever I want!&quot;</p><p>I shoved his hand off and casually tucked my hair behind my ear, my collar slipping slightly.</p><p>It was dark in the car, exposing my collarbone and smooth skin to Elliott. </p><p>Catching him staring with desire, I knew exactly what he was thinking.</p><p>He clearly wanted sex, his eyes filled with lust!</p><p>&quot;Madeline, you are...&quot;</p><p>Elliott was irritated by me. He was about to curse when his phone rang.</p><p>As soon as he saw the caller ID, he frowned but took the call. I was close enough to overhear. It was Sylvia&#x27;s assistant.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Bryant, Ms. Hart cut her wrists. She&#x27;s getting a blood transfusion now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Which hospital? Tell her to see a doctor if there&#x27;s an issue!&quot; Elliott sounded annoyed.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Bryant, please, she wants to see you tonight or she&#x27;ll kill herself. What should I do?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fine, I&#x27;m on my way.&quot;</p><p>Despite his impatience, Elliott cared enough about Sylvia to go. Before, I would have fought with him over this, trying to stop him from seeing other women. But now, not anymore.</p><p>Leaning back, I smiled and said, &quot;So, your lover is threatening suicide? Mr. Bryant, you really have a way with women.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t mock me,&quot; he snapped, glaring at me.</p><p>&quot;Fine, go see her. I&#x27;ll leave now and won&#x27;t bother you,&quot; I said.</p><p>Feeling like I couldn&#x27;t breathe, I got up to go.</p><p>But then, Elliott grabbed my T-shirt.</p><p>&quot;Trying to see them again? No way. Stay here; I&#x27;ll have Toby drive you back!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Elliott, Paige is still with Quinn. I&#x27;m worried!&quot;</p><p>I wanted to leave, especially since Paige had an accident before, and I feared it might happen again.</p><p>&quot;Shut up! You&#x27;re not going anywhere tonight. Back to Serenity Villa!&quot; Elliott commanded, then stormed off with a stern look.</p><p>Toby Santos, Elliott&#x27;s longtime driver, locked the doors and drove off to Serenity Villa as soon as Elliott left. The doors were tightly shut; no matter how much I tried, I couldn&#x27;t open them.</p><p>I knew better than to keep struggling, so I sat back and thought about Paige, feeling uneasy. </p><p>Then, I decided to give her a call. Her phone rang twice before someone picked up. </p><p>To my surprise, it was a man&#x27;s voice, one that sounded familiar.</p><p>&quot;She&#x27;s fallen asleep. Are you home yet?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="8.html">« Prev</a><a href="10.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
