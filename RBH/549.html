Looks like you're finally out of the game. I thought you had some tricks up your sleeve, but it seems not," she sneered sarcastically over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her words didn't faze me. I chuckled coldly, "And then? Sylvia, you called me just to say these things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not." She suddenly laughed on the phone, sounding quite pleased. "I called to tell you that Elliott called me tonight and asked me to meet him at Midnight Blue Club for drinks. See, he'll eventually come back to me. Haha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Sylvia finished speaking, without waiting for my response, she abruptly hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, this call was meant to flaunt her victory over me, to boast about how she had once again won Elliott's favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she probably didn't expect that upon hearing this news, I didn't feel bitter. On the contrary, I strangely felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Elliott planning to revert to his former playboy image?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Giselle hadn't captured his heart after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This late at night, I wondered if Giselle was waiting eagerly for Elliott's return at Serenity Villa, just as I once did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts in mind, I decided to call Sean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean picked up the phone quickly. He recognized my number. As soon as he answered, he greeted warmly, "Mrs. Bryant, why are you calling me so late? Is there something urgent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sean, please stop calling me Mrs. Bryant. From now on, just call me Madeline. I don't have any urgent matters. I just wanted to tell you that Elliott is currently at Midnight Blue Club, drinking heavily. You should send his current partner over to check on him," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Mr. Bryant is drinking too much at a bar? No wonder that woman said she couldn't reach him when she called. She's frantic right now," Sean replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean obviously harbored disdain towards Giselle, as he didn't even bother to use her name, referring to her as "that woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you should ask her to go check on him. It wouldn't be good if he drinks too much and something happens," I said before hanging up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Sean, I believed he would relay the message to Giselle truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did that woman really think she could secure her position as Elliott's wife just because she was carrying his unhealthy child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I feared that tonight, Elliott would leave her dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ending the call, I wished I could be there in person to witness what would unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, considering that I was pregnant, I could only hold back my curiosity and try not to go to places like bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seemed like fate was on my side. Shortly after receiving this news, I received a video call from Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I answered the call and found Fiona was also at the bar. She excitedly shouted into the video, "Madeline, are you still awake? You have to see this! It's a dog-eat-dog scene here tonight. The drama between Elliott's ex-lover and his current lover is unfolding right in the bar. It's so thrilling! I'm capturing it all on camera, so just watch without saying anything!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="548.html">« Prev</a><a href="550.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
