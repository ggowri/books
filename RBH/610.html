At that moment, he had already walked briskly towards me. He glanced at Quinn and then looked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's Paige?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he already knew what happened between Paige and Jezebel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, furrowing his brows. I keenly caught a hint of guilt flickering in his eyes. I immediately understood what it meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained silent and did not answer my question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered, "Did Giselle tell you about Jezebel being taken to the police station?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott noticed my emotions and explained, "Jezebel was an artist signed to my company. If something happened to her, I would be the first to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was true, why didn't he immediately answer my question just now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was clearly hiding something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought about the close relationship between Giselle and Jezebel and their harm towards me and Paige. I was furious and was about to lose my temper at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I snorted, "If you came here to plead for Jezebel, you better give up. Paige has already lost her child because of Jezebel. Now, she hates Jezebel to the core and won't forgive her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My indifferent words did not cause any emotional fluctuations in Elliott. He glanced at Quinn, his tone mixed with resentment and aloofness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to have a private chat with Madeline. Could you please leave for a moment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing his words, I felt that Elliott and Quinn had drifted apart. They didn't seem like good friends who had been together for many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn immediately looked at me. After I nodded, he raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll go to that corner to smoke a cigarette. Madeline, if anything happens, call me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seemed to have no desire to salvage their friendship. He patted my shoulder and walked towards the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn turned around, Elliott continued to look at him with a mocking gaze. His eyes were filled with hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call him? What is his relationship with you? </span><span>Y</span><span>our boyfriend or fianc&eacute;?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I resented Elliott's judgment of Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what relationship I have with him, whether he is my boyfriend or fianc&eacute;, it has nothing to do with you. I am single now and have the freedom to accept any man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's gaze suddenly turned cold. He suddenly leaned forward and grabbed my chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't Quinn enough? How dare you say 'any man'? Madeline, you have a talent for </span><span>making me angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott started interfering with me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt disgusted when I heard his possessive tone, so I coldly pushed his hand aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't try to entangle me. We had no relationship a long time ago. If you're here because of Paige, please state your demands quickly. I don't want to waste my time on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing my indifference, Elliott became more patient. Upon hearing my words, he did not get angry, but instead showed a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said we had no relationship? I have always been waiting for you at the crossroads where we parted ways. As long as you turn back, you will see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe that Elliott was flirting with me in the hospital corridor.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="609.html">« Prev</a><a href="611.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
