As I looked closer, I noticed that Giselle's profile picture had changed. Previously, her picture was a photo of her with Rowan, but now it had become a cartoon illustration of a girl holding an umbrella, seemingly expressing a melancholic mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously clicked on her Instagram and found that the photos she had previously posted with Rowan were no longer there. I don't know if she deleted them or hid them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she break up with Rowan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has Elliott already done something to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes. Were you with him in the evening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought about it and decided to reply to her message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, she was waiting for my message. Soon, she sent me another message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes. My mother suddenly fainted and was hospitalized. Elliott helped us. Now, my mother is fine. If he gets home safely, I won't have to worry. It's pouring rain here. Elliott didn't reply to my message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle sent me a long paragraph explaining why she messaged me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother suddenly fainted. Elliott may have helped her contact the hospital, and she was very grateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Toby seemed upset when we were in the car, he might have been worried about his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it raining heavily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we came back, the weather was still good. I was thinking, when suddenly there was a loud thunder outside the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was startled and couldn't help but scream, and my phone slipped into the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott heard my call and rushed in from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked me nervously, "What's wrong with you? Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. My phone fell into the water."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I came to my senses and instinctively bent down to pick up my phone, without noticing anything wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott walked over, rolled up his sleeves, and bent down to reach into the bathtub. Then, he picked up the dropped phone from under my legs and handed it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My attention was on my phone. Seeing the phone, I reached out to grab it. Just as I was about to say thank you, I suddenly realized that I wasn't wearing a piece of clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely naked in front of Elliott. I was exposed to him without any coverings on my entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head in panic and saw Elliott glance below my neck. I couldn't help but scream. Immediately, I hurriedly used both hands to cover my chest. I felt my whole body heating up, as if being placed in a frying pan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I was taking a shower, please leave quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have never been naked in front of a man before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw everything this time, I had no privacy at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should I do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't describe my nervousness and panic in words. That feeling was like hundreds of little deer constantly crashing into my chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was also stunned just now. His eyes stared at my body without blinking. It wasn't until I screamed that he snapped out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he would leave immediately. However, he didn't go and just stared at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you still trying to cover up? I saw everything."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="110.html">« Prev</a><a href="112.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
