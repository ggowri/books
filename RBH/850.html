Judging by the style and look, it seemed to be the latest design from Lotus, my favorite niche brand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did he know I've been eyeing this brand lately?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was utterly astounded, immediately pulling the dress from the gift bag. It was the very one I had browsed countless times.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I double-checked the size, and it's my size too. This is just too uncanny.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This brand is quite niche, seemingly only a few years since its inception. The founder is a young woman who has garnered international acclaim with a design gold award under her belt. Each piece she designs is a limited edition, but with a steep price tag, it attracts only a select few buyers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did Elliott come to know about my preference for this style?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you come to buy this brand? How did you know I fancy this style?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head, asking in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A few days ago, I saw you in a soft pink dress, and it was a sight for sore eyes. I was so taken by it that I went online to search, and found this brand called Lotus. Now that early summer is here, I think this refreshing shade of green would suit you perfectly. Plus, the unique design and cut of this dress is totally your style. Go on, try it on. I can't wait to see if it looks as good on you as I imagine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice was incredibly soft, his smile like a snow-capped mountain thawing into a refreshing stream after the bloom of spring.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many girls can resist a dress they've been longing for?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, I'm utterly incapable of doing so at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed the skirt and quickly dashed into the dressing room to change. When I stood in front of the mirror, clad in the skirt, I was even taken aback by my own stunning reflection.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dress lends me an air of elegance, elongating my figure and accentuating my fair complexion. The unique cut around the waist not only perfectly conceals the slight looseness from childbirth, but also gives the illusion of a slender waistline. What I adore most about this dress is the neckline design. The buttons are vintage-styled, each one intricately detailed, enhancing the graceful curve of my neck, reminiscent of a swan's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is my second brightly colored dress of the year.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once a woman reaches a certain age, her aesthetic seems to gradually revert back to her younger years. These vibrant colors bring such joy, and it doesn't matter if others like it or not. The key is that it pleases her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I plan on rocking it today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rummaged through the cloakroom and found an old pearl clutch I had bought a while back. I stashed my essentials inside it and then, I descended the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was waiting for me downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I descended the stairs, he looked up at me. In that moment, his gaze seemed to be set aflame.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're stunning, just as I pictured you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had barely made it downstairs when Elliott immediately wrapped his arm around my waist. He couldn't help but give me a thorough once-over, his eyes filled with admiration and pride that didn't seem feigned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The dress is stunning. Thanks!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual smile, I accepted the skirt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sensed the shift in my demeanor, his gaze softening like melting snow, tenderly falling upon me. He said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's how it should be, you should accept whatever I give you. Didn't you say I wasn't good enough for you before? Then let me make it up to you, instead of constantly rejecting me, ignoring me, disregarding me. Is that too much to ask?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Elliott's words, it only made sense for me not to refuse him any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I went straight to the office in this dress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The skirt was indeed stunning and unique. All the female colleagues in the office couldn't help but compliment me on how good I looked. Even the Finance Director, who usually doesn't pay much attention to fashion, couldn't resist asking me for the purchase link of this skirt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&mdash;&mdash;</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="849.html">« Prev</a><a href="851.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
