I angrily punched Philip a few times. However, no matter what we did, it was already meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About an hour later, the door of the emergency room opened. Then the attending physician and several nurses pushed Paige out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately rushed forward, instinctively looking at Paige's belly. When I saw that the previously swollen belly had flattened, my heart felt a sharp pain. I couldn't help but hold Paige's hand, tears streaming down my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Paige's pale face, I felt heartbroken. I couldn't speak, tears streaming down my face, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I gave up the child... It's a boy, and I don't know if he will blame me. But, I don't want him to have such a dirty father, and I don't want to bring him into this world to suffer," Paige murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finished speaking, tears slowly slid down from the corners of her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every mother loved her child. I knew Paige was sadder than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the tears on her face, I didn't know what to say. In this situation, comforting words were useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have betrayed you. I am a jerk. But, that was the child we had been expecting for so long! How could you give up on him? You can punish me, but how could you abandon our child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip kept apologizing to Paige. I knew he didn't want to lose that child. He covered his face with both hands, tears streaming down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige slowly turned her head and looked at Philip. There was no longer any love in her eyes, only infinite hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said coldly, "Philip, it was you who ended the life of our child, not me. I told you that if you betrayed me during my pregnancy, I would not hesitate to abort our child and break up with you. Now, I have kept my word. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other. Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige squeezed out the last few words with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip was shocked. Paige's words made him almost lose his balance. He grabbed Paige's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, don't do this to me. I know I was wrong. I promise to be loyal to you in the future, and such things will never happen again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip's eyes were filled with panic, indicating that he cared deeply about Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Humph! Men were all like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but secretly sneer. At this moment, Paige shook off Philip's hand and turned her head, no longer looking at Philip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough. Go deceive other women with your nonsense. I'm tired. If you feel sorry for me, don't show up in front of me again," Paige said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't see her love for Philip in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Quinn hurriedly came over. He couldn't wait and asked, "How is Paige? Is the child okay?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="606.html">« Prev</a><a href="608.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
