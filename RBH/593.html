Have they mentioned it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of this, Paige's expression turned somewhat melancholic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip's parents mentioned that the family business hasn't been doing well these past two years, with most of their money invested in the enterprise. Their stance is that it is merely a formality, and currently, they've registered this villa under Philip's name. However, with Philip being their only son, their future plan is for everything to come to us. They mentioned compensating us for any needs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, everything suddenly became clear to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Paige's family was genuinely supportive of her marriage, while Philip's family only made empty promises. This made me vaguely feel that the integrity and reliability of Philip's family might not be as solid as it seemed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, your parents don't have any objections?" I continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My dad didn't say much, but my mom thinks they might be using us. However, now that I'm pregnant, I can't break up with Philip. So, my parents blame me for being too naive, getting pregnant before marriage, and losing control. But as you know, I don't really care about money as long as Philip treats me well. I don't mind these possessions," Paige said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her radiant smile, I couldn't help but recall the scene on the yacht and felt sorry for Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had a vague sense of foreboding about her and Philip's marriage. However, seeing her heavily pregnant belly, I found myself in a dilemma, unsure whether to tell her the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, I said nothing and quickly took Paige to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we arrived, Fiona had already come out of the operating room. Upon seeing our message, she didn't even bother changing out of her surgical attire, heading straight back to her office and shutting the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige immediately approached, curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Giselle? Has she given birth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona nodded. "Yes, she had an emergency C-section. It's a boy, but he's under three pounds and has been placed in an incubator."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he a Down syndrome baby?" I asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona glanced at me, pressed her lips, leaned in close, and whispered very softly, "Those features definitely suggest Down syndrome, but premature babies don't usually look good. The Bryant family is just caught up in the joy and hasn't noticed the child's facial features yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Fiona's words, I could almost imagine the look of joy on Laura's face when she heard that it was a boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Giselle? How is she?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's still under observation in the operating room, but she's been stabilized," Fiona said solemnly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a short gestation period resulting in premature birth, can the child be saved?" Paige asked, placing her hand on her belly with a lingering fear in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With such financial means at play, the child will certainly be saved," Fiona smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to have more to say. Just then, a commotion erupted outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, someone frantically knocked on Fiona's office door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Tucker, hurry to the delivery room! The patient in bed 001 is bleeding profusely and can't be stopped, quick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle is hemorrhaging, I have to go check!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the situation, Fiona quickly donned a mask and rushed out.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="592.html">« Prev</a><a href="594.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
