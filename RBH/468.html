When he saw me, he walked straight toward me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His steps were unsteady, lacking the usual vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry followed behind him, holding the IV bag high. The scene seemed somewhat absurd, but I couldn't find it amusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my hands in my pockets, I stood silently in place, watching him approach step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were bloodshot, his once sharp gaze now sunken and tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time in my memory that Elliott stood before me in such a disheveled state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I'm still running a fever..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, subconsciously avoiding his gaze and impatiently saying, "If you're sick, shouldn't you be in the hospital? Why come to my house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't pay attention to my harsh tone. Instead, he grabbed my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His palm was scorching hot, a temperature that almost burned me, startling me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you concerned about me at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, looking at me with disbelief, appearing innocent and helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he seeking my sympathy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're feeling unwell, you should go back to the hospital early. Barry, you know he's sick, and why bring him here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I maintained my facade of indifference, turning my somewhat irritated gaze toward Barry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry had always been somewhat afraid of me. Upon hearing my words, he involuntarily trembled and stuttered, "He doesn't listen to me. Mr. Bryant... He said he just wanted to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of hurt flashed in Elliott's eyes. He grasped my shoulder, looked at me again and asked, "Are you really not going to stay with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his exhausted eyes, I could feel his longing, even his pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I began to soften again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden gust of cold wind blew, and he was only wearing thin clothes. Unable to bear it any longer, he erupted into a series of violent coughs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively grabbed his arm, shouting, "Why suffer like this, Elliott? Get into the car. The cold weather outside will only worsen your condition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I then pulled him toward his car. His breathing was heavy, his face flushed, showing no signs of the fever abating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, I noticed that he seemed to be losing strength in his legs, almost leaning entirely on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in such discomfort, he still came here to find me. At that moment, I really didn't know what to say to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to support him, we slowly moved forward. Seeing this, Barry quickly supported his other arm, making things much easier. We helped him into the backseat of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed unable to hold on any longer, collapsing onto the seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was exhausted, panting heavily. Just as I was about to leave, he grabbed my hand again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, stay with me, please? I miss you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were closed, his face burning red, his palm still scorching. The high fever had clouded his senses.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="467.html">« Prev</a><a href="469.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
