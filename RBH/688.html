He remained motionless, standing there like a sculpture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, go back. Explain to your parents why we did this, so they won't be angry with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw the situation and patted his shoulder to persuade him. Then, I turned around and walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, no matter what I did or how I did it, could I never touch your heart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn suddenly shouted behind me. And his words made my heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly stopped in my tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, how many women wouldn't be moved if they received sincere treatment from a man and received care from him that goes beyond friendship?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I lowered my head and glanced at my slowly protruding belly... From the moment I made the decision to give birth to this child, I had prepared myself for a lifetime without happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed very good, but I had already lost the qualification to start over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Quinn, you were not the type I liked, so please stop doing anything for me. It's all useless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew very well the tremendous power of this sentence, but I still let it slip out of my mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, I clearly felt a sudden pain in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? So, I was just being overly sentimental, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't turn around, but I could hear Quinn's self-mocking laughter very clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are so excellent, so it's not worth it to put in so much effort for me. I'll leave first. Since you rarely get to meet, make the most of it and have a good gathering!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not stay in the same place anymore. After saying this sentence, I quickly left at the fastest speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked all the way from the Woods villa to the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Quinn for the first time did not come after me. I think my previous words completely hurt his self-esteem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well... In this way, he should gradually distance himself from me and go in search of his own happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a bit sad, but at the same time, I also felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood by the roadside, waiting quietly for a taxi. But I never expected that a black Bentley slowly stopped beside me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rear car window was slowly rolled down, and Elliott's handsome face, as cold as an iceberg, appeared in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his head and looked at me, his eyes shining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you standing alone by the roadside? I just happened to pass by. Where are you going? I can give you a ride."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that he would just happen to appear here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, my first reaction was whether he was following me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I thought again and felt it was unlikely. Elliott always prioritized work and </span><span>was very busy, so it was unlikely that he would have leisure time to track me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. The taxi should be here soon. Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively waved my hand, indicating refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Taxi?" he looked at me with a half-smile, "It's impossible to have taxis in this area. Didn't Quinn tell you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it impossible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was slightly surprised in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn indeed never mentioned it, but there are indeed many wealthy families living in this area. I have been standing here for so long and have seen quite a few luxury cars passing by, but I have yet to see a taxi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I walked back by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a bit awkward, but I still refused Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's at least 12 miles from here to your company. Walk back? Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott asked me again, and then he opened the car door directly, gesturing for me to get in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, feeling a slight hesitation in my heart. But perhaps because I stood on the roadside for too long, I seemed to have contractions.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="687.html">« Prev</a><a href="689.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
