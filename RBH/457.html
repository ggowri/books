Even if you are pregnant and eager to replace me, you can slander me! Giselle, I regret that I was kind to you before and treated you like my sister. I didn't expect that you would do this to me! You're pregnant with my husband's child! You're so disgusting! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I spoke, I was so angry that I grabbed the collar of her dress hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fabric of the ruffled dress she wore was thin, so when I pulled it, the neckline of her dress fell apart immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trembled with shock and hurriedly covered her chest with her hands. However, her almost naked upper body still made everyone excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As a mistress, how could you be so arrogant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I hate bitches the most!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Let's teach her a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although these ladies were pampered, they all had unknown sorrows in their hearts, so they deeply hated those women who covet their husbands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My violent reaction instantly aroused everyone's sympathy. A lady took the lead and rushed over, and then several others immediately joined in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without me doing it myself, they surrounded Giselle. In a few moments, Giselle's dress was taken off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the scene fell into chaos. Giselle had never seen such a scene before, so she didn't dare to be arrogant again and screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this chaos, Quinn dragged me behind him and protected me, fearing that I would accidentally be hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough! Stop it! The baby in her belly is a member of the Bryant family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura cried and rushed forward. Seeing Giselle was bullied so hard by a gang of angry ladies, she couldn't stand it any longer and shouted out the truth. She pushed through the crowd and directly covered Giselle tightly with her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched all this happen coldly. I felt ironic to see them act like they had a deep relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ladies finally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them sarcastically said, "Oh my god, you've revealed the truth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. This is a private matter after all. For the sake of Mrs. Laura Bryant, let's stop. This is the first time I've seen someone so protective of a mistress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, let's all leave. The annual banquet will begin soon. Let's all take our seats!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The host's announcement sounded at the huge hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>See Laura was so protective of Giselle, those ladies stopped. After elegantly tidying up their appearance and clothes, they all ran towards where their husbands were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting on the ground, Giselle cried. Seeing Giselle was now wearing only her bra and panties, Laura quickly wrapped Giselle with her shawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporters had already noticed this and were taking photos of Giselle like crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Giselle was crying so hard that she almost suffocated. The makeup on her face had already been ruined, and he looked particularly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's all your fault! Why didn't I realize you're so heartless before?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="456.html">« Prev</a><a href="458.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
