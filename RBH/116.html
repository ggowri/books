Laura suddenly raised her voice. "How can you not eat? No wonder Madeline complains. As a young person, you have no self-control. You are so busy with work and have rumors with other women. Have you ever thought about the impact of these on you? Can those women give you children? Even if they can, we will not accept that child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura dared to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face turned pale. "Mom, what are you saying? I didn't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No? I read the newspaper every day. Don't think I don't know about your romantic affairs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was very angry. She walked up to Elliott and shouted, "Don't take your wife for granted and waste your energy on those women. You don't even take the medicine I gave you. Are you trying to drive me crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was so adorable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect her to say that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know her before. Every time she saw me, she had a stern face and criticized me. I thought she was difficult to get along with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that she had a lovely soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was probably the only one in the world who could scold Elliott like this, and yet he dared not argue back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I happily ate an apple and felt very good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face turned pale at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to retort, but Laura continued, "When you were in my belly, your dad often made me angry. After I gave birth to you, you also made me angry. You two are the same. You don't learn your dad's good qualities, but you learn his bad habits. Can you not be like him? Pay more attention to the people at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura got angry. She might have thought of something sad from her youth, so she scolded Jasper together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper felt uneasy and said with a stern face, "Madeline rarely comes here. Don't blame me and Elliott now. Elliott knows what he should do. Is it useful for you to worry about them having a baby? Just be patient and wait."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Jasper's help, Elliott immediately said impatiently, "Mom, Madeline and I will handle our own matters. You don't need to worry about us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you had worked hard, my grandson would have already been able to walk. Can I not worry about you? It's as easy for others to have children as it is for chickens to lay eggs. You have been married for two years and Madeline is still not pregnant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura lowered the volume, but still couldn't help but blame Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she kept on talking, Elliott would be unhappy. So, I quickly walked up and held her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you're right. Elliott and I didn't work hard enough and made you worry. Don't worry. We've been getting along well recently. We go home together and go to bed together every day. If you don't believe me, you can ask Sean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, I winked at Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott understood what I meant and said, "Mom, Madeline and I were very much in love. We would soon have a child. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was very good at lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who fell in love with him? I couldn't help but roll my eyes secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I forced myself to put on a bright smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="115.html">« Prev</a><a href="117.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
