However, I couldn't let such a thing happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I said again, "Giselle's mom only has a small flower shop. The Bryant Group, besides needing daily flowers, also requires flowers for some large events or conferences as decorations. Giselle's mom doesn't have a professional team, aren't you afraid she will delay things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly grabbed my hand. He gave it a slight tug, and I fell into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively wrapped my arms around his neck, and he securely held onto my back. He lowered his head and looked at me, his deep eyes filled with tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After Giselle woke up, she only made one request to me. How could I refuse her? You know I don't like owing anyone any favors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott held me tightly. I had never felt this kind of warmth before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In countless sleepless nights, I held a 6-foot brown teddy bear, fantasizing that it was Elliott's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I nestled in his arms and was held by him, I realized that the teddy bear couldn't compare to him. The feeling of being enveloped in his broad embrace was wonderful, and it seemed like all my bones had turned to jelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Which woman could resist Elliott's gentleness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was handsome, wealthy, domineering, gentle... any of his characteristics was enough to instantly captivate a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott's charm was too strong..." I couldn't help but sigh silently. I wasn't strong enough yet, I needed to continue improving my resistance towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I went to his office with a purpose, determined not to give up until I achieved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, being looked at and held gently by Elliott, I was stunned, unable to say a word, only feeling my face getting hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I noticed that you have been blushing a lot lately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had already felt very embarrassed, and Elliott was deliberately teasing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shyly turned my head and pretended to say calmly, "With you acting like this, which woman wouldn't blush? This is your office, don't do this. I would feel embarrassed if someone saw me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly laughed out loud. The hand on my back lifted me up a bit. My face was closer to his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was very enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were a couple. Even if we were seen, you don't have to feel embarrassed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Elliott leaned in close to me. His lips almost touched mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively leaned back. At that moment, he held my head, and I had no choice but to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes and was about to kiss me. I felt as if I was instantly deprived of oxygen, and my mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as his lips were about to touch mine, someone suddenly knocked on the door. Immediately after, Barry's high-pitched voice could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, Ms. Cole came to deliver flowers to you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="90.html">« Prev</a><a href="92.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
