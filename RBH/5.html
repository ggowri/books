But I coldly turned her down to wait for Elliott, who didn&#x27;t show up until midnight. </p><p>Meanwhile, because I didn&#x27;t accompany her for a drink, Pagie asked a group of unreliable friends to the club. Soon, she was drunk and was taken away by a bastard. When she was aware of the danger, she called me many times, but I ignored all of them and did not rush to find her.</p><p>Although that bastard was sent to prison by the Ford family the next day, Paige&#x27;s reputation was completely ruined, and our friendship utterly ended after that.</p><p>This time, I wouldn&#x27;t let it happen again.</p><p>I drove to Neon Club, which was owned by Quinn Woods, Elliott&#x27;s good friend.</p><p>The Woods family was prominent in Hoswich, and Quinn was the only heir. His family&#x27;s main business was shipbuilding, but Quinn was not interested and would rather run the high-end private club than inherit the family business.</p><p>In my previous life, among all Elliott&#x27;s friends, Quinn was the one who despised and hated me the most.</p><p>Every time I met him, he would mock me and quarrel with me. We didn&#x27;t like each other, so I never set foot at the club he ran.</p><p>Now that I had been dead for once, I had let go of all the trivial conflicts in the past. Quinn was just an insignificant person in my life.</p><p>Soon, I parked the car and walked straight into Neon Club.</p><p>This club was indeed known as the most high-end and luxurious private club in Hoswich. The moment I entered, I was shocked by the artistic decoration style.</p><p>I had grown up seeing a lot of luxury goods, so I could tell at a glance that this decoration must have cost a fortune. It was so luxurious that even the paintings on the walls used to be sold at high prices in auction houses.</p><p>Paige told me that she was in box No. 8. I walked along the corridor, focusing on my phone with my head down, and I accidentally bumped into someone.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m so...&quot;</p><p>Subconsciously, I wanted to apologize, but suddenly, I heard a gentle male voice with a hint of surprise.</p><p>&quot;Madeline!&quot;</p><p><em>Who was this person? Did he know me?</em></p><p>I was stunned and quickly looked up, seeing a handsome face instantly.</p><p>I always adored good-looking people and would be nice to them. But this was the only face I wouldn&#x27;t say I liked the moment I saw it. Because he was the man I hated the most, Quinn.</p><p>&quot;Well, Mr. Woods. I&#x27;m sorry that I show up in your club. But if you mind, I can go to another place with my friend right away.&quot;</p><p>My voice instantly turned cold. The memories of him endlessly ridiculing and mocking me in my previous life still lingered in my mind.</p><p>&quot;How could it be? Everyone here is a guest. Your friend is Paige, right? She is in box No. 8.&quot;</p><p>To my surprise, Quinn, whom I had been incompatible with in the past, instead of being angry because of my words, actually had a very gentle tone and even guided me thoughtfully. </p><p>It was unbelievable...</p><p>In my impression, he was not a good person. I didn&#x27;t know what game he was playing right now.</p><p>Although he looked nice, I rolled my eyes at him and didn&#x27;t bother to care what he thought. I just walked around him quickly to the door of box No. 8 and went in directly.</p><p>There were many girls in the room, and Paige, sitting in the center, wore a champagne-colored dress.</p><p>Seeing me coming, these girls immediately surrounded me as if they were so surprised.</p><p>I used to hang out with them when I was unmarried. But of all those people, Paige and I were closest and other than that, Fiona Tucker.</p><p>But Fiona had been studying medicine abroad for several years. I didn&#x27;t expect her to show up here today.</p><p>Fiona was equally excited to see me. She immediately gave me an intimate hug and then cheered.</p><p>&quot;Madeline! It&#x27;s been a time! You&#x27;ve disappeared from our circle since you got married. You&#x27;ve gone too far!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come on! I find it harder to meet her than the king. She&#x27;s been so focused on having Elliott&#x27;s baby for two years. She hasn&#x27;t even had time for me.&quot;</p><p>Paige held my arm and couldn&#x27;t help complaining about me.</p><p>Indeed... Since I married, I had become farther and farther away from my friends. Every time they asked me out, I would consider Elliott first, so I rarely participated in any of their gatherings.</p><p>&quot;I was wrong, okay? Well. I will punish myself with three drinks tonight! Paige, my dear baby, happy birthday!&quot;</p><p>I handed Paige the gift I had prepared for a long time. It was a diamond brooch with a sunflower pattern. It was expensive, but I bought it without hesitation to make it up to Paige in my previous life.</p><p>&quot;Are you willing to drink? Didn&#x27;t you announce at the bachelor party before your wedding that you would quit drinking to prepare for pregnancy? Will Elliott be angry if you drink?&quot;</p><p>Paige took the gift with a smile, but what I said about drinking shocked her.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m too young to be in such a hurry. I have more important things to do. Besides, I don&#x27;t care what Elliott thinks. What matters most is that I&#x27;m happy!&quot;</p><p>Letting go of my obsession, I no longer restrained myself. The moment I said these words, I felt my boredom and mania swept away.</p><p>I picked up the wine glasses placed on the table and drank three glasses in one go, causing my friends to cheer instantly.</p><p>&quot;What happened? Did you suddenly sober up or did you undergo a makeover? I feel like you&#x27;re a different person, Madeline. No matter how much we tried to persuade you in the past, you turned a deaf ear. Now you&#x27;re finally seeing reality?&quot;</p><p>Fiona was the most open-minded and sober among the three of us. She had often advised me not to get lost in love. Hearing me say this, she was, of course, happier than anyone else.</p><p>&quot;Yes, I&#x27;ve realized. We shall hang out as often as before. Fiona, you are right. Women have to have their world and careers. It&#x27;s boring to focus on men!&quot;</p><p>After a few drinks, I felt much better, hugged Fiona, and kissed her on the cheek.</p><p>In my previous life, when I had stomach cancer, everyone left me. Only Paige and Fiona were there for me. Knowing that I had no money, they didn&#x27;t hesitate to chip in and pay the surgery fee for me.</p><p>In the end, however, I was still foolish. The day before the surgery, I still had hopes that Elliott was going to meet me, so I secretly rented the cruise ship without them knowing and ended up on the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>&quot;Well... I&#x27;m not surprised at all when Fiona says this. But since you said so, I&#x27;m shocked!&quot;</p><p>Paige joked, but I could hear that they were all happy that I could wake up.</p><p>&quot;All right. Stop talking about me. Today&#x27;s protagonist is Ms. Ford. Let&#x27;s celebrate Paige&#x27;s birthday!&quot;</p><p>I changed the topic with a smile and reminded them quickly.</p><p>Everyone reacted instantly and gave birthday wishes to Paige. Then, the club&#x27;s waiter brought a birthday cake.</p><p>Tonight, we had a lot of fun, and I hadn&#x27;t relaxed like this for quite a long time.</p><p>It was so lovely not to love anyone who didn&#x27;t deserve it.</p><p>I drank a lot and needed to go to the bathroom. So Paige and I, holding each other up, staggered out of the box together.</p><p>&quot;Elliott, teach me. This cue is so heavy that I can barely hold it.&quot;</p><p>A delicate female voice came from the next box. Hearing it, I stopped involuntarily.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="4.html">« Prev</a><a href="6.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
