They are just my friends. Besides, I have just divorced, and I'm pregnant. I'm not considering remarriage. I just want to help you make Glory Group stronger. Other things are not part of my plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin tried to fix me up with other men. I shook my head desperately and quickly spoke my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Lily came over with a plate of cherries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "Your dad feels Quinn and Marcus are nice and thinks they each have their own strengths. It's hard for him to choose one of them. Rather than letting you become a strong woman, your dad hopes that you can marry a good man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, come on. I'm really not planning on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin and Lily's words amused me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At my words, Lily dropped the subject immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled, "Austin and I talked about it. I told him that we should slowly consider your marriage. All that matters now is that you need to recover and safely deliver the baby. As for your marriage, no one can predict what will happen. Besides, those two families are very powerful. Even if Quinn and Marcus are willing to accept you marrying them with the baby, I'm afraid their family may not..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Lily could finish, Austin interrupted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't matter. It's enough that they can accept Madeline. We can raise the child, and they don't need to worry about it at all! Can't our family afford to raise a child?" Austin said disapprovingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He acted like I was the best woman in the world. I was instantly amused by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about my marriage. I have just put myself out of misery. Let me live a happy and free life for a few years, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I took a cherry from the plate and stuffed it into Austin's mouth to keep him from thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, my phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took it out and saw it was Quinn calling. I quickly picked it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what's wrong? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the call was answered, Quinn asked hurriedly, "Madeline, how many masks and protective clothing are in your warehouse? I urgently need support. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from his anxious voice, I felt the situation was urgent, so I said quickly, "There are three warehouses with masks and 100,000 protective suits. Where are you? How many do you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please help me prepare 100,000 medical masks and 3,000 protective suits. Have them sent to Carthage People's Hospital, about 186 miles from Hoswich. I'm waiting here," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my impression, Carthage was very remote and the poorest county within Hoswich's jurisdiction. There was little information. The people were tough, and the economic condition was poor. It was a headache for all the councillors in Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I will ask people to prepare masks and protective suits immediately," I quickly agreed and then couldn't help but ask doubtfully. "Why did you come there?
