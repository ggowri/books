It's strange lately. Even a little drink makes me want to vomit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, feeling like I couldn't trust my own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Always throwing up? You're not pregnant, are you? Come on, I'll take you to see Fiona and see what's going on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn started the car, and we left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His offhand comment sent my heart racing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could I really be pregnant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My health is in such poor shape. How could I possibly be pregnant all of a sudden?" I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind went blank for a few seconds, but I quickly dismissed the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that be? If I could get pregnant, the Bryant family wouldn't have kicked me out!" I said sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn turned to look at me, his face a mix of pity and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the 21st century now. Women are not breeding machines. I can only say the Bryant family is heartless. It's not your fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Quinn's words were blunt, they always managed to comfort me. Hearing him say that, I couldn't help but tug at the corner of my mouth, squeezing out a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was about to drive out of the Jade Restaurant parking lot when, just before reaching the gate, he suddenly slammed on the brakes and sternly glanced at the rearview mirror. A few seconds later, he started the car again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His inexplicable action surprised me. I couldn't help but ask him, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That car behind us is Elliott's. Were you with him tonight?" Quinn asked, looking puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was treating a client to dinner, and I just happened to run into him." I replied honestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you ride with him? Don't tell me you guys just had a falling out?" Quinn quickly guessed something was up and pressed me for an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle is pregnant with his child. Quinn, it's over between him and me," I said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was trying to sound composed, but for some reason, my voice still trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Quinn exclaimed, almost slipping the steering wheel, "He admitted it? That jerk, he really did go back to Giselle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angered, Quinn pounded the steering wheel. Due to his excitement, he accidentally hit the horn, which blared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he admitted it," I said weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned back in the seat, watching the torrential rain furiously lashing against the window, no longer in the mood to explain more details to Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Giselle really did have Elliott's child. Whether Elliott agreed willingly or was forced, it didn't change the facts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was so furious he nearly jumped out of his skin. If he weren't driving, he'd have turned around and given Elliott a good thrashing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just divorce him, then. There are plenty of good men out there, so you shouldn't waste your youth on him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a while before Quinn spoke up in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had advised me the same before but still wished us well when I was with Elliott. But now, perhaps it wasn't just me. He had seen enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think so, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, my already made up my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn suddenly sped up, but I noticed we weren't heading towards my house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, where are you taking us? This isn't the way to my house!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Quinn had made a mistake and quickly called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unexpectedly, he didn't slow down at all, saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just not at ease. Let's go to the hospital for a check-up! Even if you're not pregnant, it's still a good idea to get checked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn made the decision firmly, giving me no chance to argue. Just like that, he took me to the hospital where Fiona worked...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="435.html">« Prev</a><a href="437.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
