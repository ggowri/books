Did he also experience rebirth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, at the moment when I sank into the sea, I vaguely felt a strong arm pulling me. Could it be that it was Quinn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recalling the previous accident that happened on the yacht and that incredibly similar feeling, I couldn't help but suspect that Quinn might have also been reborn with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he was fully supportive of Elliott and took great care of Giselle, while constantly mocking and insulting me, showing no concern for me at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since I was reborn, Quinn has been really good to me, genuinely good, and I even doubt if Quinn has been completely replaced. Otherwise, why would he have such a different behavior in my two lives?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like you don't need to feel guilty, just enjoy my kindness towards you. Understand?" Quinn repeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not this sentence. You just said, 'to live again for me'. What does it mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him keenly, astonished beyond measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn panicked for a moment, as if he wanted to desperately hide something. He immediately said, "I didn't say that. You must have misheard. I said I'm living for you. You've been moving a lot. You must be hungry. There's a pasta restaurant up ahead that happens to be open. Let's go. I'll take you to eat something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn pointed forward and quickly changed the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to delve deeper into this topic. However, Quinn gave me no chance to do so. He directly instructed the driver to pull over the car, and then led me into the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky had gradually brightened up. The early workers had already started bustling on their bikes, and the roads had also gradually filled with the traces of cars and people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after we had just taken our seats, the pasta restaurant began to gradually get lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn ordered a large set of pasta and a glass of milk for each of us. We quickly started eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was already spring, the weather remained very cold. After eating pasta, I felt much warmer in my stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I got back to the car, I had already been yawning constantly, and sleepiness suddenly came over me. Soon, I fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was probably too exhausted, and coupled with being pregnant, I slept very heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know how long it had been, but I distinctly heard Quinn calling my name. I heard him say we were home, and I really wanted to open my eyes and wake up, but the deep drowsiness made me turn over and continue to drift back to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a hazy state, I vaguely felt Quinn embracing me with his extremely strong arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the bumpy ride, I heard him mutter, "Why am I so good to you? Because I </span><span>don't want to see you suffer anymore or end up in such a state of loss and being trampled upon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was very soft. Probably because the surroundings were too quiet, I heard this sentence clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I struggled for a bit, wanting to wake up from the dream and talk to Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, I became increasingly drowsy. Soon, I no longer remembered what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I woke up the next day, I found myself wearing pajamas and lying in my own bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I woke up, I immediately recalled the scene from last night. However, I remembered everything clearly except for Quinn's words, which I couldn't seem to recall no matter how hard I tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat on the bed, trying to remember for a long time, but it was still in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I got up and went to the living room in my pajamas.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="659.html">« Prev</a><a href="661.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
