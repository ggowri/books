I opened my phone and saw countless comments on Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the numerous comments, Quinn's comment stood out, as he commented on me, saying, "You were the most beautiful today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I naturally understood the hidden meaning in his words, so I replied to him with a smiling expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I'm here! Wow, filming is so lively, there are so many people!" Paige's voice came through at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman, who was like a gust of wind, was actually directly attracted to the scene by my Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, she pounced towards me and grabbed my arm. She looked me up and down carefully, and couldn't help but praise, "Wow, I've never seen you wear a classical long dress before, you look really stunning! Why didn't you tell me you were starting today? I could have worn a classical long dress to celebrate with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are so busy, how would I know if you have any free time?" I said with a smile, feeling an indescribable joy when I saw Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk, you're just reluctant to share the young male actor with me, aren't you? Hmph, selfish!" Paige teased me on purpose, but I knew deep down she didn't actually think that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, soon I saw several workers carrying several exaggerated large flower baskets to the scene, and then they lined up in a row under the LED big screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I came to see handsome guys, I couldn't come empty-handed. These flower baskets were personally made by me and brought over from Louis City. So, what do you think? Am I good or not?" Paige proudly pointed at those flower baskets and said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, no matter when, you were always my best friend, I understood," I looked at her proud little face and couldn't help but give her a kiss, then said sentimentally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did Paige know, she immediately wiped her face with disdain. "Ugh, enough with this lace nonsense. Quickly introduce me to the young male actor. I think this young actor is quite good-looking. Handsome, how old are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige couldn't hide her infatuation nature and directly set her sights on Adam, who was closest to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam had never seen such a bold woman before, and he was scared. He quickly waved his hands and stepped back. "Miss, I am not a celebrity. I am Madeline's assistant, assistant..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, Madeline's assistant is also my assistant. Come here, little brother, don't be afraid, I am very gentle." Paige didn't care about all that, and immediately started arguing with Adam on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched as the two of them played around on the set, and suddenly I had a stronger feeling that a new chapter of life was about to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this feeling of being completely at ease, I had never experienced it in my previous life... It turns out, not loving and letting go can bring such happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a bit nostalgic in my heart, and just then, I saw not far away a group of gentlemen in suits, surrounding a tall and outstanding man, walking towards the other side of the film and television city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a glance, I knew it was Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at their posture, it was clear that they had come to this film and television city for some kind of investigation. No wonder he suddenly appeared here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared silently at the figures of the group, and unexpectedly, out of the blue, Elliott suddenly turned back. His gaze pierced through the crowd and landed directly on me from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, without warning, we found ourselves separated by a sea of people, our eyes meeting...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="145.html">« Prev</a><a href="147.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
