Watching him sway with a hint of mischief in his swagger, I felt overwhelmed with gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is your attitude towards Elliott now because of this guy?" I was completely caught off guard when my mom suddenly appeared behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly misunderstood my relationship with Quinn. Her unexpected remark stunned me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly turned around to find my mom glaring at me with fury in her eyes. I hurriedly explained, "Mom, what are you talking about? Quinn is just a good friend of mine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? I just saw him pinching your cheek and patting your head. Don't forget, you're Elliott's wife," my mom said disdainfully. Obviously, she held Elliott, her son-in-law, in high regard. She was actually defending him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was just joking with me. Don't overthink it, Mom. Without him this time, I couldn't have sorted out many things," I said, patting her shoulder and holding her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've liked Elliott for so many years. Before, when Elliott didn't care about you, I noticed it. But now, I can feel that Elliott has really changed a lot. You should cherish him. Don't wait until you lose him to regret it, understand?" My mom began her lengthy lecture again. I nodded hastily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Mom. I know how to handle things with Elliott. Don't worry about anything else and just take care of Dad."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom had lost a lot of weight recently because of my dad's illness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't bear to see her worry about me and Elliott's relationship. I comforted her a few times before she finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was very efficient. In less than half a day, he had arranged for several bodyguards to guard the door of my dad's hospital room. He even found a female bodyguard to accompany my mom to ensure her safety.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With bodyguards guarding the hospital, I felt a bit more relieved about my parents' safety.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to return to Glory Group to continue working, the Chief Financial Officer Katrina suddenly called me. "Madeline, are you available to talk right now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice sounded cautious over the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm available. What is it, Katrina?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've found some strange things while investigating Jade's financial transactions over the past few years. I'm at the office now, so it's not convenient to talk. Can we meet somewhere?" Katrina whispered on the other end of the line.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that everything was similar to the situation in my previous life. Jade indeed had a lot of secrets.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, I immediately suggested, "Alright, let's meet at Lantern Cafe. They have private rooms, which will provide us with privacy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, I gave some instructions to my mom and quickly grabbed my bag, heading towards Lantern Cafe.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="314.html">« Prev</a><a href="316.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
