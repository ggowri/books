No one'd never guess he came from one of those ancient aristocratic families in Hoswich, like the Woods family. They'd been around forever, dabbling in all sorts&mdash;business, politics, you name it. But they were like ghosts, lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Quinn's parents were into business, with their fingers in a bunch of pies, but he never really talked about how powerful they were. Sly devil, huh?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People love kissing up to those in power, don't they?" Quinn said, grinning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled at his sass, about to shoot back when my phone suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly grabbed my phone and saw it was my mom calling, so I picked up right away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I picked up, my mom's crying voice blasted through the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, get to the hospital now! Someone's trying to drag your dad out of here and kick us away!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart jumped into my throat at her words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, take a deep breath and ignore them for now. I'm on my way!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing my mom's frantic voice, I ended the call in a daze, not even bothering to chat with Quinn. I spun around and bolted towards my car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn grabbed my arm. "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I shouldn't have let Elliott transfer my dad to another hospital in the first place! Quinn, just keep doing your thing. I've gotta get to the hospital now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so steamed that I didn't have time to explain much to Quinn. I hopped into my car and revved the engine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked super worried, like he wanted to tag along. But just then, a stunning woman with short hair called out to him from behind and dashed over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was too worked up to see who she was. I just peeled out of there and raced to Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I barged into my dad's ward, chaos was everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broken bits of stuff littered the floor, and the flowers were all smashed. My mom sat in a chair, bawling her eyes out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, in a hospital gown, stood with her mom and a bunch of bodyguards. She shot me this haughty look, like she owned the place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor and nurse on duty were there too. Seeing me, the doctor pulled me aside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Mrs. Bryant. We tried to stop it, but they said it was Mrs. Laura Bryant's orders, so we had to back off. Hope you understand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understand? How could I possibly understand why everything was such a mess?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad was still in that bed, fighting for his life. Couldn't he get a little peace?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to Giselle, my voice dripping with rage. "Giselle, what's your deal? Don't forget, Elliott and I are still married!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="390.html">« Prev</a><a href="392.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
