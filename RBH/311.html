It had been a long time since I had humbled myself, sending him messages or calling him like before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, I had broken the habit of being overly dependent on him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even though I realized this, I still didn't want to reach out to him out of stubbornness. Pushing his hand away, I whispered, "Your mother has pressured me to divorce you more than once. Even if I were to contact you, it wouldn't change anything. My current health condition cannot fulfill your family's desire for offspring. Our divorce is inevitable."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but recall Laura's repeated pressure and the shadow-like presence of Giselle. And thought about my inexplicable infertility, I felt agitated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Elliott and I now had a substantial relationship, deep down, I still hadn't mustered an ounce of confidence in our relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many things were like hidden time bombs, readied to explode between us at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dared not sink, commit, and believe too much in Elliott's sincerity. Because the pain I experienced in my previous life was truly unbearable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I guessed Laura's repeated coercion was something she had never mentioned to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out and grabbed my shoulder, looking at me incredulously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean, my mom has pressured you more than once? What did she say to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What she said, you can probably guess, right? It's not her fault either, after all, I couldn't do what mattered most to them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart ached. Ever since I knew about this situation, it had been the biggest concern in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite seeking medical help in Louis City and taking medication on time every day, I wasn't sure if the doctor's prescription would be effective for a congenital condition.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for not wanting Giselle to take over so easily, I would rather divorce Elliott earlier than endure this much torture.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've said it doesn't matter. You don't have to worry about my parents' thoughts. The most important thing is the feelings between us."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me earnestly. Realizing I had suffered injustice from his mother, he embraced me without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My head rested firmly against his warm chest. His strong heartbeat was so close to me. His embrace was so warm that it began to melt the facade of strength I had been maintaining.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a woman could rely on a man, why bother to stay strong?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, I almost wanted to cry in his arms and tell him all the suffering I had endured in these days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But my reason kept reminding me, Madeline, you must not.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because once I relied on him again, it meant falling in love with him. And once in love, it implied enduring the heart-wrenching pain of the past all over again, day and night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was afraid of the pain. I would instead choose to stand alone in this world...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're a dutiful son, and I know how Cormac holds a place in your heart. Elliott, actually, you and I know better than anyone else, without children, we won't last long."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed his hand away forcefully again. At the same time, I quickly stepped back a few steps and walked to the other side of my father's sickbed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I said this, I looked at Elliott, tears welling up in my eyes uncontrollably. But I didn't want him to see my vulnerability.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly turned away and wiped the tears from my eyes. At that moment, my mom happened to push open the door and walked in.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="310.html">« Prev</a><a href="312.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
