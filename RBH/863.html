These shares, perhaps they would have tempted me in the past. But now, Glory Group is in its prime, its market value might not be far off from Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, being the only child of my parents, everything that Glory Group owns is mine. I don't have to compete with anyone for it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ten percent stake, I'm not particularly fond of.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Noah, he's the third generation of the Glory Group, the heir to our Mayers family. He doesn't need their charity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? For free?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a cold laugh, then asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper gave a slight shake of his head, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, there's a catch. You have to agree to be with Elliott and have at least three kids."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew they couldn't possibly be that generous, handing me a ten percent stake with no strings attached.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three kids... If it's about loving a man, building a family with him, maybe I could consider having three.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if it's just for the sake of money, sorry, I'm not a baby-making machine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the freshly squeezed corn juice from the table, took a gentle sip, and said coldly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten percent of Bryant Group's shares, the annual dividends are just a few tens of millions. Sorry, I don't need it. I'm currently focused on my career, not considering having children for now. If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave. Enjoy your meal."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said all that, I wiped my mouth, rose to my feet, and prepared to take my leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, having kids is a decision for Madeline and me to make, not for you to plan when and how many. I'm full now, you guys take your time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I was about to leave, Elliott rose to his feet, intending to depart with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was instantly flustered, hastily grabbing my hand, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, come with me to my bedroom, I've got something to show you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was clueless, but I had no choice but to follow her into her bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon reaching her bedroom, she immediately bolted the door shut.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Elliott gone, there was no need for her to keep up the act. She looked at me, and said bluntly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already apologized, what more do you want before you let us see the child? If the child truly isn't a Bryant, then I'll let it go. But your insistence on keeping me from seeing the child only proves that it must be Elliott's. Why else would you stop me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew it, all this drama they've staged, it all boils down to one thing - Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what you do, no matter what you say, there's no way I'm letting you see the kid. So, you might as well give up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said coldly. After finishing, I turned around, ready to pull open the door and leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, a heavy "thud" suddenly echoed from behind...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="862.html">« Prev</a><a href="864.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
