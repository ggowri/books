I glanced at the ingredients listed on the back of the box; at first glance, there seemed to be nothing special. However, Marcus told me that two of the ingredients inside were relatively scarce and expensive on the market, which explained why this medicine was costly to produce and had minimal profits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to speak, a gust of wind blew in. I suddenly started coughing violently, and my nose began to feel uncomfortable as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about spending time with Elliott today, I suddenly felt worried that I might have caught a cold from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I covered my mouth, coughing for quite some time before it stopped. Seeing this, Marcus hurriedly came to my back to pat it. After I felt a bit relieved, he sat directly beside me, gesturing for me to give him my right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take a look. You don't look very well, and your tongue appears a bit pale."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I handed him my right hand, and he pressed his fingers on my wrist pulse. After a while, his expression suddenly became serious, and then he gestured for my left hand as well, which I complied with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I was completely immersed in the excitement of developing this medicine, forgetting that I was already pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus came from a family of doctors. After a while, he suddenly glanced at me meaningfully, then said with a pleased expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it seems I have to congratulate you. You're pregnant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned all over, only realizing it suddenly. In that instant, I blushed like a child caught in a secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is good news. You've been married to Mr. Bryant for some time now. Lily has often brought up the topic when I've treated Austin. She expressed her hopes for your pregnancy, and now, they'll surely be overjoyed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said joyfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Please don't tell them about this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I exclaimed hastily. My reaction surprised Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? This is a huge joy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My expression instantly dimmed. I lowered my head and smiled bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My marriage with Elliott is almost over for some reasons, and they know about it. I plan to keep this child, but I haven't figured out how to tell my parents yet. And..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sensed my difficulty and became serious immediately. He patted my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I didn't expect you and Mr. Bryant to encounter marital problems as well. However, since this is your child, any decision you make needs to be carefully considered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, it's hard to explain everything clearly right now. I'll tell you slowly when there's a chance in the future. What do you think about the situation with this child now? I went for an ultrasound a few days ago, and the doctor said there's only an embryo for now, without a heartbeat, so I'm a bit worried..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking that Marcus had medical skills, I took the opportunity to ask him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put your hand up, and I'll take another look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied without hesitation, immediately instructing me to place my hand on the table, and then he earnestly began examining again...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="472.html">« Prev</a><a href="474.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
