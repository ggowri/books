He gave me a strange glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice suddenly became gentle, and he said to Giselle, "Alright. If you come down now, I promise you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the answer I expected. However, when I heard Elliott say these words, my heart ached for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle sensed something from Elliott's tone. In front of me, she gently said to Elliott, "Elliott, I feel so cold. I have no strength in my body and my legs are weak. Come and hold me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her delicate voice gave me goosebumps all over my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively looked at Elliott. At that moment, he focused on Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what he was thinking. He was very indifferent to Giselle just now. After I appeared, he seemed like a different person. He walked towards Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the onlookers, he took off his coat and wrapped Giselle in it. Afterward, he held her in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have just given birth to a child. Don't be angry. And don't punish yourself with your own health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the gaze of the crowd, Elliott performed his tenderness towards Giselle. His indulgent tone was familiar and heartbreaking to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he do this to stimulate me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood still, trying to appear indifferent. However, I didn't know why my body was trembling. Chills ran from the soles of my feet to my forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't send me and the child abroad, okay? Elliott, we just want to be by your side. I promise I will be a good wife. I won't make you angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle nestled in Elliott's arms. She appeared gentle and submissive. The photographer beside them kept pressing the shutter, capturing the scene of their affectionate gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Let's talk about it when we get back," Elliott replied softly. Then, he slowly lifted his head and looked at me standing in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he tightly pursed his lips. I couldn't see his emotions from his deep eyes. He held Giselle and walked towards me step by step, brushing past me, and heading towards the exit behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment when we passed by each other, I felt a proud gaze cast upon me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't look up, but I knew whose gaze it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I wouldn't let her be proud for too long... I silently swore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott took Giselle away, the onlookers quickly dispersed. Soon, the rooftop returned to tranquility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona walked over and patted my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She angrily said, "Damn it! Elliott is a jerk. How could he be so intimate with her in front of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She gave birth to a child for him. It is normal that they are close. It's fine. I don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to be indifferent and shrugged my shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona saw through me and said to me, "Really? If you didn't care, you wouldn't be standing here alone in a haze. Madeline, maybe you can deceive others, but you can't deceive me. I know you very well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I no longer cared about him. I just wanted to get back at him."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="619.html">« Prev</a><a href="621.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
