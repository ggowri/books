I had been retreating step by step, until finally, I could only attempt to utter a pleading voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, don't," he said, "you are my wife." He had no intention of stopping, and as soon as he finished speaking, he stripped off my coat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you were so selfish, you didn't love me at all!" I opened my eyes, struggling and shouting at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he acted as if he hadn't heard a word, his eyes filled with a strong desire to conquer, as if he had to conquer me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, if you hurt me today, I will hate you for the rest of my life, I swear," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, please stop it. The person you love is not me at all. Why are you treating me like this?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott! Just for your little desire for conquest, you treat me like this. Don't you think you're simply a beast?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched as he took off each piece of clothing from my body, and I watched as he was about to proceed with the next step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tears flowed uncontrollably, and all kinds of words poured out of my mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was not until this moment that I realized, I had been resisting him all along, resisting to the point where his touch did not bring me any happiness, but instead a nauseating feeling that I couldn't put into words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stopped when he was about to take the final step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, my words and actions gradually extinguished the evil fire in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coercion would not receive a response, such a simple truth, he could not possibly not understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brows and looked at me with deep and perplexed eyes, filled with intense confusion and bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably didn't understand why this woman, who had once eagerly waited for his pity and even drugged him to gain his pity, would now resist him so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you..." he wanted to ask something, but halfway through his sentence, he didn't ask it. Instead, he rolled over from me and lay weakly on the side, sighing heavily towards the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly sat up and immediately found my clothes to put on haphazardly, without a moment's hesitation, I flipped off the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can rest here if you want, I'm leaving," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to stay in the room with him for long. In fact, I was starting to feel more and more suffocated by the air when I was alone with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came over these days, just to wait for you," he said behind me, his low voice causing a slight tremor in my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, then you don't have to come any longer. The injury on my head has already healed, you don't have to worry about it." My tone remained distant, I admit, I was surprised that he wanted to get close to my parents, but I didn't feel touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't we be together properly? Like other couples?" he asked once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment when I heard this question, I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lowered my head and buttoned up the buttons one by one. I said softly, "Perhaps soon, you won't think like this anymore. You will wish that I stay away from you, just like you did before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on their current progress, they should have fallen in love with each other soon, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than waiting for him to come and ask for a divorce, I'd better take the opportunity to withdraw while I am still sober, so as to avoid being hurt by him again and find it difficult to recover later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you always think that I would fall in love with someone else?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="187.html">« Prev</a><a href="189.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
