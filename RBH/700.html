Why do you ask?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You went through my diary, yet you never noticed how many years I had liked you. You read every line of text in my diary, yet you have no idea why I liked you. Elliott, do you think that by doing this, you love me?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched him calmly, but only I knew that I was actually suffocating at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I suddenly understood why Elliott couldn't impress me with anything now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, I knew better than anyone else that he was just more concerned about me than before, rather than truly loving me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just moved by the love recorded in my diary, and then possessiveness went crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea what I wanted at all. He just treated me as a familiar object in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the belongings no longer belonged to him. Suddenly, he had a sense of self and thoughts, and there were other people around him. So, he became flustered, that's all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was left speechless by my question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he had never cared about those things, and of course, he couldn't have cared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because even until now, he himself doesn't know what kind of feelings he had toward me, he probably never even thought about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at his silent appearance, shrugged my shoulders, and chuckled lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I loved you for a whole decade, during the best years of my youth, from when I was eighteen to twenty-eight. However, during these ten years, you never cared, or even completely ignored me. How many decades can a woman have? I gave you my best years, but what did you give me? Countless cold glances, countless contempt, countless hurts. Even when I later married you, did you ever truly understand me? I was just an object you brought home. You didn't care about how I looked, my personality, or even my emotions. You always overlooked me. But, after using something for a long time, there might be some feelings, right? So, when I mentioned divorce, you realized that you might lose me, and finally... you shallowly loved me for a moment, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spoke in a calm tone, so calm that there was not a single ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But actually, my heart, at this moment, felt like an onion being peeled layer by layer, very painful, very piercing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's pupils trembled for a moment, his Adam's apple moved, and he said, "Madeline, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't let him speak, but interrupted him directly, "I haven't been happy at all in the ten years I've been with you. I revolve around you and you're like my everything. I was just like a moth to a flame. I thought that by doing this, one day you would be moved, and gradually realize my goodness, but in the end, I only understood that the more I did this, the more insignificant and worthless I became in your eyes. So, I woke up, and I decided to leave you. I made this decision seriously, not on impulse, and not to seek revenge. I just woke up. Do you understand, Elliott?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My voice was gentle, without a trace of emotion, as I looked at him with a calm gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel that his reaction was intense and his pupils were rapidly changing, as if layers of emotions were progressing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that he was attentively listening to my heartfelt words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's also rare, after so many years, that Elliott, for the first time, listened to me so attentively, listened to me talk about what I wanted, instead of implying what he wanted to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I brought up the idea of divorce, you did change, but it was more about being increasingly concerned about me compared to before. However, your concern was not because of love, you just felt uncomfortable losing something that you could easily obtain and had become accustomed to. I actually knew what you were thinking, but I still decided to give it a try with you because I had invested ten years into this relationship, and if possible, I also hoped for a good ending to my love story. So, even though you never said you loved me, I still gave it another try with you. But what was </span><span>the result, Elliott?" I said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="699.html">« Prev</a><a href="701.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
