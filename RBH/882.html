Let's go then."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rose to my feet, leaving Glory Group side by side with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Elliott didn't bring along a chauffeur. He drove himself, taking me to a nearby mall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my memory, this mall seems to be a part of the Bryant Group, housing a collection of well-known brands. A store selling sporty attire even takes up an entire floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I rode the elevator down to the first floor. Perhaps it was mealtime, as the mall was fairly bustling with people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not entirely comfortable with Elliott constantly holding my hand, yet, he grips it so tightly. It's as if he's afraid I'd vanish if he's not careful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was clearly familiar with this mall, leading me through its labyrinth with ease. We moved swiftly, quickly ascending from the first to the third floor, a level dedicated to sportswear brands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pointed at a store up ahead and said to me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I often shop this brand, their styles aren't half bad. They roll out new stuff every season. Come on, let me show you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I silently trailed behind him, my gaze irresistibly drawn to his striking silhouette.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott has always maintained a great physique, with long, lean legs and a classic V-shaped torso. He looks handsome in anything he wears, but when he dons a suit, he truly resembles a male model straight off an international runway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strolling through the mall with a man like him, I was the recipient of countless envious glances from other women.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this scene, it was once a figment of my imagination during my teenage years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People often say, the most beautiful thing in life is to marry your first love, have children, and grow old together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for the twists and turns that later unfolded, my heart would be brimming with joy instead of the bitterness it now holds.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We stepped into that store.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The store manager personally came to greet us, his demeanor was incredibly attentive and respectful:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, it's an honor to have you here. Why don't you relax in our VIP lounge? I'll have our staff bring you our latest seasonal collection right away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'm not the star of the show, my wife is. I'm just here to help her shop for clothes."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott flashed a gentle smile, his gaze softly landing on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This doting demeanor made the store manager have an epiphany in an instant:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see, Mr. Bryant. It's truly an honor to meet your wife. You two really make a perfect pair."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This store manager is fully qualified to run such a large establishment. She has a knack for charming others in conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the manager say this, Elliott swelled with pride:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lady is the shining star among the female entrepreneurs of Hoswich city. Her attire must be unique and fitting to her persona."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott is showering me with compliments.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The store manager caught Elliott's drift, nodding her head in immediate understanding:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I got it. I'll personally select the clothes for Mrs. Laura Bryant. Please, you and Mrs. Laura Bryant make yourselves comfortable in the lounge. I'll have coffee sent over to you right away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The store manager made a respectful gesture of invitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott casually took my hand, leading me into the lounge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Elliott and I settled in, the barista swiftly brought over our coffees.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand was trembling. As she served the coffee, she couldn't help but sneak a peek at Elliott.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="881.html">« Prev</a><a href="883.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
