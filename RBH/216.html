Then, Elliott drove the car and set off to Nicole's flower shop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was driving with one hand, and the other hand hung down naturally. I knew Giselle was sitting behind him, so I took the initiative to reach out and hold his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was stunned for a moment but did not refuse. Instead, he allowed me to hold him while he was looking ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle sat in the back seat, and I didn't know how she was feeling at the moment. I didn't look back to see her expression. I just talked to Elliott casually about our daily life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Giselle suddenly said, "Madeline, you two have such a good relationship that I can't even get a word in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What? Were you kidding? In my last life, you easily interfered in my marriage with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought this in my heart, but I smiled and said intentionally, "After all, we are talking about trivial matters between husband and wife, so it's normal that you can't interrupt."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished speaking, I deliberately looked back at her and saw her angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she saw me turning around, she still smiled, "You're right. I heard from Laura that you often quarreled, so I thought that your relationship was not very good. Now, it seems that I was overthinking."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle spoke so directly that she even said our relationship was not very good in front of Elliott and me. If I hadn't seen her behaviors in my previous life, I would have really doubted her emotional intelligence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you hope our relationship is bad?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my eyebrows, looked at her, and asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was obviously panicked, quickly waved her hands, and denied, "No, no! Of course, I hope your relationship is good. How can I think like that? Madeline, you are really good at joking."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll be at your home soon, Giselle. Is Toby at home today?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned a corner and asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't come back today and said he was going on a date with his girlfriend. Elliott, do you want me to call Toby back?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle replied sweetly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. Since he finally has a date, we'd better not disturb him," Elliott answered in a low voice and smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Toby will be 30 years old next year. My mother is very worried about his marriage," Giselle responded quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you made the decision about the house?" Elliott asked suddenly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The house?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but be shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remembered that it seemed to be the same time in my last life when Elliott bought Giselle an apartment of 2,000 square feet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, after I found out about this, I quarreled fiercely with Elliott. But he didn't care about my opinion and still insisted on buying them a house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, although I have delayed the time when Elliott and Giselle fell in love, there seemed to be other things that hadn't been changed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My brother, my mother and I all went to see the house. The house was nice, but my family don't have much money. Even if we buy it on mortgage, it will be very stressful. Toby is afraid that he can't afford it," Giselle muttered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What house is it? Elliott, why haven't I heard you mention it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't repress my curiosity, so I interjected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned to look at me and then explained slowly, "Toby doesn't have a house. Giselle and her mother are renting a house at Hoswich. Toby has worked hard for me for so many years, so I'm going to sell a house at Sunlight Residence to them at the lowest discount price."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sunlight Residence?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was not the apartment in the previous life, the Sunlight Residence was one of the few excellent properties developed by the Bryant Group, which not only had a good location but also had beautiful views.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not expect that Elliott had planned to sell it to Giselle's family at the lowest discount price.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="215.html">« Prev</a><a href="217.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
