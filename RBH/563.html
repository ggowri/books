Then, I looked at them coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Customers like us who arrived earlier should be kicked out because he had reserved? Mr. Bryant, when did you become so extravagant? Do you have to reserve the place just for a bowl of soup?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finally spoke, "I just want to drink soup quietly and don't want to see anyone I don't want to see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he referring to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'm sorry, but I've spent money too, so I won't leave until I finish eating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave him a cold and sarcastic look, then turned and went straight to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, I came out of the bathroom. Unexpectedly, I found Elliott standing at the door of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't he just say that he didn't want to see the person he didn't like?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was he standing here now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I frowned in displeasure and said, "Sorry, you blocked my way. Mr. Bryant, do you have a perverted hobby of peeping on women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If your child is Quinn's, I advise you to think twice. You do not know Quinn. He is not a good person. If you fall in love with him, you will only be hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was waiting here just to say this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's none of your business. Do you have nothing to do? I don't need your care," I looked at him and said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was a little angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just kindly reminding you that he is not that simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your kindness, but I don't need it. I feel good to be with Quinn. You should worry more about the women around you. You don't have to worry about me. You're just my ex-husband! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I crossed my arms across my chest and looked at him coldly, deliberately raising my chin to show disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now when I faced him again, I was no longer gentle but indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He became even more unhappy, pulled my shoulder, and said harshly, "I know I'm sorry for you, but I don't want you to be with someone else so soon. The child in your belly is Quinn's?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me suspiciously. And his apology sounded like sarcasm to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered, "Of course. Your family thinks I am a useless waste who can't get pregnant. Haven't your parents and grandfather made this conclusion long ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked guilty for a moment. However, I ignored him again, knocked his hand away, and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cursed him in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now I couldn't understand what he meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I returned to the room, Quinn was standing by the window waiting for me, and the dishes on the table had been cleared by the waiter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn shrugged slightly apologetically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The waiter said that a big shot had reserved the store. We happened to finish eating, so I asked her to clean up first. Madeline, are you full?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't full, but I was so angry that I wasn't in the mood to eat anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded. Before I could tell Quinn that Elliott was the big shot he mentioned, I received Sylvia's message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Ms. Mayers, I invited Elliott here for dinner. I didn't expect to meet you. You are divorced, so you wouldn't mind me hanging out with him, right? I just sent that bitch pictures of me and Elliott on our date. I heard that she started to bleed again.]</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="562.html">« Prev</a><a href="564.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
