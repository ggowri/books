Alyssa didn't expect it and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us burst into laughter upon seeing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned red instantly. Obviously, Elliott had embarrassed her to the point that she wanted to disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, it's too noisy here, let's change the place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked serious and annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, I know a great place, I can take you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa quickly got up from the ground, unwillingly still wanting to continue pleasing Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, had clearly no intention of paying any more attention to Alyssa. He shouted, which frightened Philip, who hastily signaled Alyssa to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa gritted her teeth in anger, her beautiful face contorted. However, she didn't dare to show her anger in front of Elliott, despite feeling a strong sense of resentment inside. Disheartened, Alyssa walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott slowly turned his head and glanced towards us. I met his gaze, and in that moment, I distinctly felt that he smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat down and poured whisky for himself, drinking one glass after another, as if it were water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shall we continue playing, or?" Quinn noticed that we were all looking over there, so he asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, let's continue!" I glanced in that direction and said immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the four of us continued the game. Soon, our laughter filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that with all the commotion we were making, Elliott would surely not be able to bear it and would quickly leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't expect that he seemed to be a nail stuck there. Elliott not only didn't leave, but also kept drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His behavior scared Philip. Philip said, "Elliott, stop drinking. You will get drunk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sounded lonely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, stop. Seriously, your health is the most important thing," Philip advised again, but Elliott seemed indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously glanced at him again and noticed that Elliott's face was slightly flushed due to alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat under the dim light, which accentuated his distinct profile. His strong hand held a glass of whiskey, his expression seemingly filled with endless thoughts. Elliott tilted his head back and then poured a large glass of whiskey down his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whisky was strong, but he didn't even furrow his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was Elliott doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he showing his sadness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked away disdainfully, but for some reason, I felt like all the joy I had tonight was destroyed by Elliott. Suddenly, I no longer had the desire to play around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't he leave? Why is he still drinking? Madeline, does he still care about you?" Fiona noticed something unusual and asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the difference? Elliott doesn't deserve any sympathy," Paige said disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had given up on love after being hurt by Philip. For now, she trusted no man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood up at this moment. He had probably drunk too much alcohol, so he lost his balance when he stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bottle of wine on the table, was instantly knocked over by him, which made a </span><span>harsh sound.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="651.html">« Prev</a><a href="653.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
