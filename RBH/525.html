Carole had already rushed over, kicking it repeatedly in frustration. Learning that the door was locked, she cursed and turned away unwillingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn focused on getting rid of Carole, unaware of how close he was to me. His face was inches away from mine, and I could feel his breath on my skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paid all his attention to the small window on the door and hadn't noticed at this time that my face already blushed from embarrassment, and he continued, "The fierce Carole is pretty scary. No matter what happens to me next time, don't call her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn," I whispered, trying to remind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did she leave? I suspect she hasn't left yet. She must be lurking next to the door, preparing to launch a surprise attack as soon as we open the door!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, still gazing alertly out of the window, did not discover that his lips had nearly touched my ear and that his body had clung together to mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a little suffocated but couldn't voice it directly, thus prompting me to call out his name louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn turned his head and looked at me in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why do you keep calling my name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Perhaps sensing my red face or finally the fact that our bodies almost overlapped, Quinn subconsciously jumped back.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his face flushed crimson. Yet, he failed to realize that his hospital gown had snagged a button on my chest. With a sudden movement, the gown came undone, revealing his abdominal muscles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I distinctly observed as his gown unraveled, revealing Quinn's flat stomach and even the area below it since the pants were quite loose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned for a few seconds. Embarrassment overwhelmed me. I quickly turned my head away and covered my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I did not see anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so sheepish that I yelled in a hurry and didn't dare to move my hands away again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was clearly flustered. I heard a rustle, most likely him adjusting his clothes. Then, he whispered, "Sorry, sorry. I just tried to escape from Carole but didn't realize we..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably was at a loss for words. As he spoke, his voice suddenly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I moved my hands away and cautiously stole a glance at Quinn. I didn't dare to open my eyes until he had already put on his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. I know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were embarrassed again. Quinn blushed, and so did I. He scratched his hair, and I lowered my head in bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very strange. Usually, we could talk about anything, but in such an awkward situation, we both suddenly became taciturn and instantly unfamiliar with ourselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn lay back on the bed silently, and I lingered by the door. After a long moment of silence, it occurred to me that Adam had mentioned Oliver's desire to meet me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'll go to Dr. Muller's office," I said hastily, feeling as though I had stumbled upon the perfect excuse to leave. Then, I pivoted on my heel, promptly exited Quinn's ward, and made a direct beeline for Oliver's office...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="524.html">« Prev</a><a href="526.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
