His eyes, I noticed, were a startling shade of crimson.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had barely finished wiping him down before I could button up his shirt. At this moment, a large expanse of his chest was bare, his slender neck and sexy Adam's apple undeniably exposed. He sat upright on the hospital bed, his face radiating a compelling intensity, exuding an aura of regal majesty as if he had returned from a victorious battle. His lips were tightly pressed together, his demeanor as unyielding as if he had never been gravely injured.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his gaze was hollow. Although he was awake, his eyes remained unblinking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't respond to my words. Not only did he not respond, but his hands also began to wander over my body. Moreover, he suddenly seemed desperate to tear open my collar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what are you up to? Are you awake yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sudden move gave me quite a start.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily grabbed his hand, desperately trying to wriggle free from his embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his grip on me was so tight, so unyielding, I couldn't break free. Meanwhile, his other hand was frantically exploring under my clothes, wildly searching every inch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how I screamed, how I struggled, he remained silent. He sat there, his eyes vacant, but his hands never ceased their motion. Even more, the more I struggled, the harder he worked, showing no signs of letting me go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've just given birth, with wounds still fresh and healing. And my chest, due to nursing, throbs with a constant ache.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sudden exploration sent a pain through me so intense, it felt as if I was about to explode. I screamed for help, pushing him away with all my might, but Elliott was like a man possessed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he flipped over, pinning me down with force.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned down, sealing my lips fiercely with his own. Simultaneously, his hand slipped under the hem of my clothes, kneading more aggressively. The pain made me involuntarily gasp for air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We're clearly in a spotless hospital, yet I can't shake the feeling that something's off with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was so large, the entire weight pressing down on me, nearly suffocating me. Just as I was struggling desperately but unable to break free, thankfully, the door to the hospital room finally swung open.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two burly bodyguards swiftly moved in, yanking Elliott off me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was panting heavily, sitting up in bed with my heart still racing. To my surprise, the person who appeared before me was none other than the long-lost Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oddly enough, the once lively Elliott had returned to his calm demeanor, lying motionlessly on the hospital bed, as soon as Laura and her crew burst into the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this very moment, I'm a mess. My hair is disheveled, my clothes torn to shreds. There are several red marks on my neck, and my arms are covered in bruises. I'm sitting on the ground, a picture of utter defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing me, Laura's initial reaction was shock, quickly followed by anger. Then, she stormed over, fiercely grabbing my collar and bellowed at me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what the hell were you just doing to Elliott? He's a sick man, for God's sake... You... You're just too damn reckless, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What? Me, a libertine?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, watch your tongue! I was just cleaning Elliott up when he suddenly lunged at me. You... you better not spread rumors!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blurted out without thinking. The recent scene still sent shivers down my spine, leaving me utterly baffled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What just happened to Elliott? How did he suddenly turn into such a state?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="767.html">« Prev</a><a href="769.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
