To be honest, I didn't have the mood to eat supper either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I could tell that you were troubled. It would make you feel better if you spoke out your worries. Stop wasting time, come up here, I'll carry you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was actually quite similar to Elliott in some ways, decisive, assertive, and not allowing others to say no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words touched a chord in my heart to some extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I crawled onto his back, and he carried me into the restaurant, and we found a quiet corner to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he ordered some meat and seafood, and specifically ordered a soup for me. Then, he began to speak:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I guess correctly, were you left on the road by Elliott again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His insight was so sharp that I didn't expect it, he guessed it right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know?" I blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said firmly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This road was the only way back to Serenity Villa. If you were alone, you would definitely drive or take a taxi by yourself. Moreover, I just figured it out, you had cried, you were definitely upset by him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I forced a bitter smile and suddenly didn't know what to say. I lowered my head and took a sip of coconut juice, "Luckily I met you tonight, otherwise I really don't know what would have happened. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps it was destined that I would be your guardian angel!" he said proudly. Then, he added, "Madeline, let me say it again, it would be better for you to separate from him if you are not happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people wouldn't advise others to break up, but he was different from others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head and looked at him with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want me to break up with Elliott like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed and denied it, saying:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't want you to break up with him, I was just worried that you would get hurt even more if you continued to be with him. We grew up together, and I know him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think he could never fall in love with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but ask it out, but the moment I asked the question, I regretted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like you still love him," he looked at me sharply, picked up the beer on the table, took a few sips, and said, "Madeline, if you continue to be trapped in your feelings for him, I'm afraid that in the end, not only will you not be able to get revenge on him, but you will also destroy yourself once again. So it's better for you to let go of this relationship sooner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words, like a sudden enlightenment, made all the nerves in my body tense up instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Revenge? Ruined myself once again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he suddenly say such words?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When did he know that I had destroyed myself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did you know that I wanted to get revenge on Elliott?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn, unable to hide the confusion in my heart. I realized that there was a deep mystery hidden in his dark brown eyes, and I didn't know what that mystery was, but I felt... after coming back to life, he seemed to know me very well, more than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what did you mean by the words you just said?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at him intently, hoping to see something in his eyes. However, I found that his gaze remained calm and serene. He quickly finished a whole bottle of beer and then said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to worry about what I mean. Anyway, I just want to tell you that if you want to get back at Elliott, then you have to learn not to care. 'Not caring' is the best weapon for revenge. If you still care about him, then you should leave him as soon as possible. Leaving is also a way to protect yourself. In any case, I don't want you to be unable to leave and be trapped in your love for him. Like in the past, becoming a pathetic loser. Madeline, your life is still beautiful and not worth stopping for anyone or anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he said these words, he kept looking at me, with sincerity in his eyes, just like an old friend I had known for years.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="130.html">« Prev</a><a href="132.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
