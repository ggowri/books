"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother was much happier to see Elliott than to see me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately stood up and greeted him with a smile. Her tone was so affectionate as if she had seen her son.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, don't worry too much. I will pay for all the costs of the transfer. I also worry about Austin's health as he didn't wake up until now, " Elliott held my mother's shoulders and said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom was so happy to see what Elliott had done. Then she turned her attention to me. "Madeline, what do you think? I listen to you"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't answered yet, but Elliott had already put his hands on my shoulders affectionately. "Madeline listens to me. Let's just do it. We are now going through the transfer procedures for Austin. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't even give me a chance to speak and decided everything directly and domineeringly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Quinn said, "Are you sure this transfer wouldn't be disagreed by your parents?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glanced at Quinn indifferently and finally noticed his existence. "This is our family's business and has nothing to do with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Since you are here, then Madeline, I leave first." Quinn smiled desolately. He patted Elliott's shoulder and said goodbye to me. Then he turned around and quickly walked out of the ward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I vaguely felt that he came to the hospital because he worried about my safety and wanted to take a look at me in person to reassure himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't know why I was worthy of Quinn's concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his leaving figure, I felt a little bit sad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when I looked back at Elliott, I found that he was staring at me fiercely. His face darkened again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't say much this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott accompanied me to complete all transfer procedures and he also specially arranged a car to transfer my dad to the Bryant Hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we arrived at the Bryant Hospital, several authoritative experts were waiting for us. As soon as my dad was admitted to the hospital, they immediately organized a joint consultation and sent my dad into the operating room for observation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of us were waiting outside the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the lights in the operating room, my heart suddenly rose to my throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing my worry, he took me into his arms to comfort me. "It's okay. They are capable of finding the cause."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope so. Yeah, your mother came to the hospital to see my father today, and she also brought Giselle. " I subconsciously raised my head and looked towards Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mother? What is she going to do?" Elliott frowned his brow and asked me. He didn't know about this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, there is another thing I want to tell you. When I accompanied Paige to the gynecology department, I saw your mother and Giselle entering the B ultrasonic room. Giselle showed off to her friends last night that she was pregnant..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at Elliott's eyes, trying to find out his reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was shocked by what I said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's pregnant? My mother accompanies her to the B ultrasonic room? Maybe you have recognized the wrong person?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were firm enough to demonstrate that he wasn't lying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know. Are you sure you and Giselle have no..." I was confused for a moment and couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I explained to you last night. Do you still doubt me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned his brow again. It was obvious that he was extremely unhappy with my suspicion.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="341.html">« Prev</a><a href="343.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
