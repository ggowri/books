It was obvious that he cared about this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I was still distraught. Because my father was still in danger, I didn't have time to care about these details at the moment, so I said a little impatiently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this important, Elliott? The most important thing now is that my dad can wake up. I don't care anything else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott didn't know the hidden worries in my heart. He seemed even more disappointed when I said this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My wife thought of someone else instead of me when something happened to her father, isn't this important?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now what do you want me to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked, looking at him helplessly. I didn't expect Elliott would care so much about such trivial things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that you don't need me to come here. You haven't even called me. If I didn't call you, you were not going to tell me about this, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was confused again by the question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, from the time my dad had the accident until the rescue was over, I never thought of calling him... This was a fact.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I was silent, he pursed his lips silently. His gloomy face made me anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to explain, but I didn't know what to say. He waited for a while, looked at the people present, and suddenly said in a low voice, "You told Quinn immediately, and you even told your best friend Paige and Fiona. But I was the last one to know this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he looked like a neglected wife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I had never seen or imagined him being like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was arrogant and even refused my request to meet him when I was dying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could I have imagined that such a person would be so upset because I didn't notify him immediately when my father had an accident?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained silent, and then subconsciously tugged on his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he threw away my hand angrily. He turned around and walked in the direction of Lily. I thought he was leaving. Unexpectedly, he walked up to Lily and said, " What about transferring Austin to the Bryant hospital? The medical capabilities there are better than here, and the doctors are more experienced. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was angry, but he didn't vent his anger in front of everyone. He still maintained his usual cold and arrogant image.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily immediately raised her head after hearing this. She was a little tempted, but she still said with some concerns, "I don't want to bother you again..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing,"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I originally thought his proposal was a good one. But then I thought that Cormac was recuperating in the Bryant family's hospital. Now he wanted me to divorce Elliott. Would I cause trouble if I sent my dad to Bryant Hospital? It might be better to let my dad recuperate quietly here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, I immediately blurted out, "No need, the doctor said my dad will have to stay in the intensive care unit for observation for a few more days. He can just stay here for the time being, and it's not good to let him move around at this time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I said this, Elliott looked at me immediately. His expression and eyes instantly became serious and gloomy...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="296.html">« Prev</a><a href="298.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
