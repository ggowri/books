I handed Quinn a bottle of water. He took it and instinctively reached out to tidy up my disheveled hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as we were about to set off, unexpectedly, there was a sudden "click" behind us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone was clearly taking a photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately grew wary and turned to look behind me. To my surprise, standing at the entrance of Bryant Hospital, pregnant and clad in a maternity dress, was Giselle, with her mother beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was holding a cell phone. It seemed she had just captured Quinn's gesture of fixing my hair on camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Giselle intended to use the photo to complain to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave her a cold glance. I cared little about what Elliott thought now, let alone her petty schemes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents were still in the car. To avoid affecting their mood, I couldn't be bothered with her. I shook my head towards Quinn, signaling him to leave with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Giselle walked over and suddenly blocked my path. She sneered, "So, Austin finally decided to leave the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at her swollen belly sidelong, feeling a wave of indescribable disgust. I ignored her, bypassed her, and headed straight to my car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she persisted, intentionally tugging at my clothes and saying, "Madeline, you really think you can wedge yourself between Elliott and me, and he'd just turn his back on me?&nbsp;Let me tell you, you're wrong. The instant he caught wind of my stomach issue, he hurried over to console me, even got me the VIP treatment, putting me up in Bryant Hospital's finest suite. I bet you've never had that kind of royal treatment, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must admit that Giselle knew precisely how to inflict an emotional wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I couldn't discern the truth of her words anymore, hearing her say that hurt me deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at her increasingly refined face, the Chanel brooch on her chest, the Cartier watch on her wrist, and the Hermes bag she carried. Each item spoke volumes about her rising status, which only deepened my sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this lifetime, even if she couldn't immediately win Elliott's love, she could still firmly control the hearts of the entire Bryant family with her child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I destined to lose to her once again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong sense of unwillingness surged within me. Looking at her smug face, I couldn't help but sneer, "Giselle, look at you, so pleased. I bet you haven't checked today's trending topics, have you? Your bestie's dirty laundry has been aired for all to see. I wonder if Elliott regrets taking your advice and roping her in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What trending topics? What are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle clearly hadn't heard about this yet. My words changed her complexion drastically, and she asked in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smirked, watching as she quickly pulled out her phone. With that, I couldn't be bothered to say anything more to her. I simply pushed her aside and got into the car.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="418.html">« Prev</a><a href="420.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
