I fell for his words and actually dipped a bit into the mustard. As a result, the spiciness left me gasping for air. Annoyed, I immediately punched him a few times.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you've crossed the line!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha, ha, ha... I've found you to be so naive. You believe everything I say."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me in tears and with a runny nose from the spiciness, Quinn was doubled over with laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot him a speechless glare. Just as I was about to say something, I caught a glimpse of a familiar figure passing by our tent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the figure vanished in an instant, her silhouette and hairstyle jolted a memory - the woman from last night, Lisa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What are the odds, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is it possible that she's everywhere I am?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it just be a woman who bears a striking resemblance to her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I poked my head out, trying to get a clear view. But by the time I did, there was no one in sight. She must have slipped into one of the tents, I figured.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at? Did you bump into someone you know?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn saw me peeking and curiously asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you ever look into that bottle of booze from last night, and the woman who brought it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to Quinn, questioning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of which, I find it rather peculiar. I had someone examine the wine from last night, and it was just ordinary fruit wine. Moreover, everyone else who drank it was fine, only you and I had such a strong reaction. I later reviewed the surveillance footage from the room and noticed that the woman seemed to flick her fingernail when she was pouring our drinks. Perhaps she had some kind of aphrodisiac powder hidden in her nails."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you catch that woman and get to the bottom of it? Honestly, she doesn't strike me as a good person. Plus, she gives me this eerie, lingering feeling. I ran into her at that vacation hotel in Norch City. Quinn, could you look into it for me, find out who she really is?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearful of eavesdroppers, I deliberately leaned in closer to Quinn, lowering my voice to a whisper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn caught on immediately, he whispered:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was planning on looking into her anyway. Zara is so innocent, I'm worried she has an ulterior motive for getting close to her. Also, if she really did drug us last night, I'm a bit confused about what her endgame is. What do you think, why would she do something like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She seems to have taken quite an interest in Elliott. If she's indeed the one who drugged us, her motive isn't too hard to guess. She simply wants us to make a public spectacle of ourselves, then capture our embarrassing moments. But then again, I can't be sure. Up until now, I still have no idea what this woman is truly up to."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was whispering with Quinn, the two of us huddled close together. But since we were already so familiar with each other, I didn't find our proximity inappropriate at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, out of nowhere, footsteps echoed outside our tent. Next thing I knew, a tall, imposing figure was standing right in front of Quinn and me...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="800.html">« Prev</a><a href="802.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
