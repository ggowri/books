I'm not used to sleeping with you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held me a little tight, and I instinctively tried to push him away, but I couldn't budge no matter how hard I tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly pinned me down and asked me softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have been married for two years, but we haven't had sex right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect him to suddenly say something so blunt and embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My face turned red in an instant. His eyes were staring straight at me, as if he wanted to devour me. I didn't dare to look at them at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said you wanted to keep the distance from me. Elliott, what's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to break free from him again, but to my surprise, he saw me struggling, so he simply tied my hands and pressed them directly on top of my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath sprayed onto my face, and his handsome features magnified infinitely before me. I had never felt him so alluring before, and my heart couldn't help but start pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, do you want it or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted my chin, and his eyes seemed to be carrying countless hooks, slowly sucking away my soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was confused by his question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are all adults. Don't play dumb with me, Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed again, with a slight curl at the corners of his lips, like the gentle ripples that spread across the surface of a lake in springtime, captivating and enchanting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not playing dumb. I really don't know what you were saying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dared not look into his eyes anymore. I was afraid that if I continued to meet his gaze, I would be more and more flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he seemed to know what I was thinking. He lifted my chin and forced me to meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to tell you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately covered my mouth with mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't utter a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I felt a suffocating lack of oxygen in my brain, and my whole body seemed to stiffen up all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tongue pressed against my lips and teeth, despite my desperate attempts to keep my mouth shut and struggle. However, he continued to attack relentlessly like a warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His one hand tightly held onto my hands, while the other hand slipped through the hem of my nightgown, winding around my waist like a snake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I... I have never experienced such intense and direct love from a man until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind went blank, my heart started racing, and I felt like I was about to be completely overwhelmed by his dominant attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I was about to sink into this suffocating deep kiss, the suffocating feeling of drowning in the sea from my previous life suddenly hit me like a giant wave, snapping me back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was I doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was I easily melted like this by Elliott's cheap love?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was clearly being driven by drugs at this moment, and it was not at all what he truly wanted to do with me. This was not something he would normally do to me at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't love me at all. Moreover, he would meet his true love tomorrow. I have already foreseen what would happen in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was I supposed to completely surrender myself, like in my previous life, and foolishly let him hurt me, just because of his temporary infatuation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, absolutely not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong obsession quickly gathered in my mind, and at this moment, Elliott was already holding my face, kissing me passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obviously was about to lose control of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't keep doing this. I had to find a way to break free from his confinement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened my eyes and subconsciously looked around. Finally, I fixed my gaze on the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remembered the moment I woke up after being reborn, I was also under the influence of drugs. He dragged me to the shower and poured cold water on me fiercely until I regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since that's the case, today, why not let him experience the feeling of cold water splashing on his head randomly?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="43.html">« Prev</a><a href="45.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
