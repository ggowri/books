You don't need to explain it to me," I responded calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up, took a deep breath, and suddenly said, "Once her child is born, I'll provide her with a hefty compensation to ensure her stability for the rest of her life. Madeline, I never actually intended to be with her. I found out about the divorce license. It was my mother who saw me sign the divorce agreement, took matters into her own hands to process our divorce, and then sent it to you without my knowledge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I became even more bewildered, thinking, "Is Elliott explaining himself to me? Why is he telling me all this now? Is he seeking my forgiveness and wanting to get back together with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told me he was unaware of everything. He didn't know about Giselle's pregnancy or the origin of the divorce license. He was just a helpless, unwitting victim forced into divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh. "What do you hope to achieve by telling me all this now? We're already divorced. I hope you understand that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, his gaze filled with resignation and deep frustration. "What can I do for us to reconcile? Madeline, I admit, I haven't been able to forget about you these days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sounded unlike his usual demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he claimed he couldn't forget about me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't been idle these days. While cozying up to Giselle, who was about to bear his child, he didn't forget to meet up with his old flame, Sylvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he was trying to deceive me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he love falling in love with his old lover that much? He was really good at lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh. "Elliott, stop teasing me, okay? I admit I used to love you like crazy. You could give me a piece of candy, and I'd forgive you for slapping me. But now, I've grown up. I'm not the foolish woman I used to be, blindly trusting you. We're divorced. Save these sentimental words for your next girlfriend. I'm tired. It's time for you to go to Giselle. Hurry up and go. Don't keep your son waiting for too long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to hear any more of his seemingly heartfelt words. I yawned and turned to lie down, signaling for him to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott reluctantly got up. Before leaving, he sighed deeply, "Someday, you'll understand my heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finished speaking and quickly disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dozed off. As soon as the nutrient injection was finished, I couldn't wait to leave the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of curiosity, I glanced through the glass at the next ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, I heard lyrical music playing inside while Elliott was fully engrossed, reciting stories to Giselle's belly in his husky, magnetic voice. And Giselle was happy and intoxicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This bastard had just professed his undying love for me, and now he was happily enjoying the warmth of family life with Giselle and their unborn child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But perhaps my baby would never experience such happiness?" As I thought this, I gently placed my hand on my abdomen and whispered, "Baby, don't worry. Even if you don't have your father's company after you're born, I'll still make sure you're the happiest child in the world."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="568.html">« Prev</a><a href="570.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
