When I saw his bare, slightly tanned upper body, I was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to say... Since we got married two years ago, this was the first time that Elliott wore so little clothes in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past two years, Elliott was very defensive to me. When he was with me, Elliott would either be dressed in a suit or wrap himself up tightly, as if afraid that I would do something bad to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, I didn't know what was wrong with Elliott. He boldly showed his muscles in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hmm... Elliott had a quite decent figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The muscles on his upper body were well-proportioned and strong, and they looked perfect under the light. Coupled with his handsome face, Elliott was undoubtedly sexy, making my heart beat faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was highly unlikely that I felt no attraction when a man I had been infatuated with for many years shamelessly displayed his body in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I secretly drooled over his body, I desperately tried to control my desire. At the same time, I couldn't help but angrily mutter to myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, it's a waste that such a sexy man doesn't belong to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott did not notice my gaze. He stood in front of my dressing table, drying his hair with my hairdryer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Elliott turned around and walked towards the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall figure moved towards me, giving me a sense of pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart skipped a beat, and instinctively I pulled the blanket over myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what are you doing? Your mistress attempted suicide. Shouldn't you comfort her tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glanced at me. Then he pulled the blanket over and slept in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I never stayed out overnight, you should be aware of that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was I?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't aware... We had been married for two years, but Elliott had never shared a bed with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the first year of our marriage, I used to eagerly wait for Elliott to come back like a newlywed bride. However, as time went on, I gradually lost hope as I would often wait until midnight without his return. I always secretly wiped away tears and went to sleep alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't sleep in the same room with Elliott, so how could I possibly know what time he came back or if he stayed out overnight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you will sleep here tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was very close to me. Although I didn't touch his body, we were under the same blanket, and I could feel his warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our sudden closeness made me feel uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, I would have been overjoyed when he acted like this. Perhaps at this moment, I would have ignored everything and thrown myself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I found myself vigilant. I did not hope for his approach, nor did I want to approach Elliott. I only wanted to guard my territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew better than anyone else that he didn't love me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our wedding bed, Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott did not say it clearly, but the meaning in his words was self-evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively moved to the side. Elliott probably didn't expect it. He turned to glance at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you acting like this? That's not like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott thought he knew me well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed and took a deep breath. Then I uncovered the blanket and got out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is our wedding bed, and it is your right to sleep on it. So, here's the deal, you sleep here, and I'll go sleep in the guest room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finished speaking and walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, his big hand suddenly grabbed my wrist tightly, and then I fell heavily onto the bed. To be precise, I fell into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's embrace was wide and warm. The moment I fell into his arms, my face touched his strong chest. Because I nearly fell, I was firmly embraced by him. The friction between our bodies made me feel thirsty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not good... My self-control was limited. If I continued like this, there might be trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly broke free and moved to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said firmly, "Elliott, you said that I should keep my distance from you, so what are you doing now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked at me as if he was watching a clown. His gaze was icy and it felt like he could see right through me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sneered and laughed, "Madeline, did you think I wanted to sleep with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect him to be so straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not the case. I just find it strange."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart rate had started to accelerate, and my face, without any surprise, should have turned red. Therefore, I dared not meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, I was afraid of his deep eyes, which could capture my soul, just like in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to worry, and I have no interest in you at all," Elliott continued with a sneer. Then, he lay back on the bed again. Out of the blue, he said, "But I just realized my parents came, and they might be hiding outside the door listening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... What? Jasper and Laura came?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did they visit late at night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe it. When I came back, the house was peaceful and quiet...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it made sense. When I was changing my slippers just now, I did find that the two pairs of unused slippers on the shoe rack were missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought the servant washed them, but now upon reflection, I suddenly feel something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents-in-law had given us an ultimatum a month ago, stating that I must get pregnant by the end of this year. They even mentioned that they would secretly come over to supervise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, they secretly came to inspect us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Elliott acted out of character tonight and came to my room. I thought he had a guilty conscience and felt remorseful, but... He just did this to cheat his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart, along with my brain, cooled down instantly. And when I looked up at Elliott again, my feelings for him just disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just pretending to avoid their questions, so you don't have to be so sentimental. Go to sleep, and I won't touch you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was afraid that I wouldn't understand, so he took the trouble to explain his motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I fixed my hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, since they came so late, they probably haven't eaten anything. Go to sleep, and I'll go make them some late-night snacks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I casually found an excuse and went to the wardrobe to change into my pajamas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to cook supper for my in-laws. I just wanted to go out and catch my breath. Being with Elliott made me feel suffocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I changed into my pajamas, I opened the door. Suddenly a chaotic sound of footsteps came from the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I watched as two elderly people, one wearing red pajamas and the other wearing green, hurriedly walked towards their bedroom. Their serious yet amusing appearance made me realize that Elliott's guess was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were indeed hiding outside our door, listening for our sound...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="10.html">« Prev</a><a href="12.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
