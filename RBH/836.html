They were subsequent blockbusters.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the two TV shows they've invested in are set to become major hits in the near future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were originally part of my investment plans.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what caught me off guard was that the Bryant Group had unexpectedly taken the lead as the investor this time. And their investment acumen was so spot-on, it was as if someone had tipped them off about which ones would be a hit in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doubts began to creep into my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, I took an impromptu two-day business trip. By the time I wrapped up my work and returned to Hoswich City, it was already dusk the following day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott made a point to come pick me up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite not sharing my itinerary with him, he still managed to show up right on cue, catching me completely off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he saw me, he wrapped me in a big, warm hug.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he lifted my chin, planting a gentle kiss on my forehead, "Haven't seen you in two days, did you miss me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how to respond, so I simply fell silent, offering a small smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you must have missed me. Last night, you were gone, and I was up all night, unable to sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott spoke in a nonchalant manner. His weary eyes indeed testified that he wasn't lying,"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't Dr. Jones' prescription doing anything for your insomnia?" I couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pulled me into a warm embrace, his lips brushing lightly against my hair. "You're my cure," he murmured. "No matter how good Dr. Jones' medicine is, it doesn't work on me like you do."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I really can't be with you tonight. I haven't visited my parents for days. I need to stay over at their place tonight," I said, a frown creasing my forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blink of an eye, it's been several days since I last saw Noah and my parents.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though my parents send me photos and videos of Noah every day, the more I see his adorable antics in the videos, the more I yearn to go back, to see him, to play with him, to hold him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm itching to see my son.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll go with you. It's been a while since I've played chess with your folks," Elliott said, his hand gently caressing my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hastily declined, instinctively stepping back, "Elliott, even though we're married, I don't like this. You can go spend time with your parents, and I'd like some alone time with mine. If I want you to come to my house, I'll let you know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm a bit upset, especially after learning about the recent moves of the Bryant Group. It's added a new level of clarity to my thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Elliott has lost his memory, it doesn't seem to have affected any decisions at the Bryant Group. On the contrary, the recent moves by the Bryant Group have been so significant that it makes me wonder what exactly Elliott is up to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slight fluttering of my heart for him, after two days of cool reflection, had completely faded away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rejected it outright.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott froze. He was clearly unhappy, but he respected my decision nonetheless. "Alright," he said, "I have a dinner party tonight anyway. It's good for you to spend some time with your parents. I'll drop you off."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. Adam has already sent a car for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To save myself the hassle, I don't want him to have the slightest clue about my parents' current address.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="835.html">« Prev</a><a href="837.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
