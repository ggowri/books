You can't do strenuous exercise yet. What if the wound falls apart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We chose to forget about the awkward situation before. Hearing my words, Quinn said with a grin, "I'm fine. The wound was all scabbed. I have a good immune system. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring my word of warning, Quinn continued to press his hands against the wall and strained to do push-ups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spotting a box of food beside him, I assumed Quinn hadn't eaten yet and urged, "Quinn, eat first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is what Carole bought, and none of it is my favorite. I believe she did it on purpose! How could there be a sister as inconsiderate as her in the world?" Quinn complained angrily, amusing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you and Carole have a rocky relationship since childhood? It seems like you struggle to communicate pleasantly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a wonder I can communicate with her. She's been intentionally bullying me since we were kids because she's two years older. And as for why I'm unwilling to inherit the family business, it's simply because I don't want to be around her," Quinn grumbled with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, despite Quinn's complaints, it was evident that he didn't harbor much hatred towards Carole. Moreover, they actually cared about each other. Otherwise, Carole wouldn't have immediately rushed to Carthage in desperation upon hearing of his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on. Stop exercising. Whether it's your favorite food or not, you need to replenish your nutrients now. Carthage is now unsealed, and when you're discharged from the hospital, we can pretty much go back to Hoswich. There's still a whole lot of things going on over there," I said as Quinn persisted in his workout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'm strong enough to skip a meal or two. If you don't believe me, I can prove it by picking you up. Holding you is a piece of cake for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having likely not exercised in quite some time, Quinn was still trying to be brave. Suddenly, he turned around, leaned over, and lifted me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His action caught me off guard. I let out a cry of surprise, and he yelled, "Damn it!" Immediately, I was thrown violently onto the hospital bed, his whole body instantly on top of mine!&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing Quinn's face beaded with cold sweat and contorted in agony, I was momentarily overcome with panic. Ignoring my own well-being, I asked with concern, "Quinn, how are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still leaned up against me, his handsome face impossibly close to mine. He grimaced in pain and put a hand on his abdomen. It took a long time before he finally got a little better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should have listened to you. It looks like the wound really has opened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Let me have a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Quinn's words, I was so anxious that I subconsciously tried to get up from the bed to check his injuries, completely ignoring the fact that he was pressing down on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;As I rose, my lips touched his face, which doubtless meant that I had actually kissed him!&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the realization of what had occurred made my brain buzz and go momentarily blank. Just then, Elliott's clear and cold voice unexpectedly came from the doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="526.html">« Prev</a><a href="528.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
