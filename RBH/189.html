I have seen how crazy you were in love with someone a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart was filled with countless sorrows, but I couldn't say anything. After quickly putting on my clothes, I picked up my suitcase and turned around. I glanced at him and bid farewell calmly, "I'm leaving, Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me with a melancholic expression in his eyes. He sat up and reached out, attempting to grab my hand, but perhaps my prickly appearance, like that of a hedgehog, made him give up. In the end, he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's strange, this is clearly my room, and all the items clearly belong to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it seems like everything has been taken over by Elliott, I have no attachment at all, so I just opened the door and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as I reached the staircase, I thought for a moment and decided to turn back and put the diary back in the drawer, locked it securely, and then closed the door to the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I went downstairs, Lily was still arranging flowers in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me carrying luggage and Elliott not following, she was surprised and quickly approached me to ask, "Madeline, what are you doing? Where is Elliott?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, he fell asleep. I need to hurry to Louis City. When Austin wakes up, can you help me talk to him?" I looked at Lily and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily stared deeply at my neck for a moment, and a meaningful smile immediately appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly realized that Elliott must have left another hickey on my neck. Embarrassment instantly spread across my cheeks, and without saying much to Lily, I immediately rushed out of the house, stepped on the gas pedal, and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I drove directly to the headquarters of Glory Group, intending to go to the office to retrieve some documents. By the way, I wanted to have a chat with Katrina, the financial director of Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Katrina was the daughter of Austin's distant cousin, and back then, she was also nurtured and promoted by Austin from a low-level accountant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, all the financial data and secrets of Glory Group were in her hands, and according to Austin, she was a very diligent person. Austin trusted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I distinctly remember in the previous life when Austin was kicked out by the entire board, various loopholes in Glory Group's accounts became one of his stains. If she was truly a trustworthy person, why were there so many loopholes in the accounts at that time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, I had to find a way to understand the accounting issues of Glory Group as soon as possible. Only by knowing oneself and the enemy, I could have enough leverage in dealing with Katrina and her father in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I specially brought a box of handmade pastries made by Lily for Katrina. In my impression, this middle-aged sister in her forties loves to eat snacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Lily loved the pastries she made, and combined with the fact that she and Austin were distant relatives, I quickly became close to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Katrina, what about Austin? He expressed an interest in letting me know more about our company's situation. I would like to start with the financial aspect. Could you please make a copy of the financial statements from the past year for me? I will study them when I have free time, as a form of learning. Is that possible?" Feeling that I had almost wrapped things up, I immediately asked directly about the main topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Katrina seemed somewhat surprised and hesitantly said, "But financial statements are highly confidential data, and without authorization from Austin and the other directors of the board, if I were to give them to you hastily, I would be held responsible if something goes wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her response was within my expectations, so I leaned in close to her ear and whispered, "Katrina, I heard that your daughter is about to start high school, but her grades are just a little below the best local high school. I know the principal, maybe I can put in a good word for you. Plus, think about it, I am Austin's only daughter, how could I casually leak financial reports to others? Since I dare to ask you for it, it naturally represents Austin's intention, don't you understand?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="188.html">« Prev</a><a href="190.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
