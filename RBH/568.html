You're exaggerating," I replied absentmindedly, not looking at her but staring at my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued to lavish praise, "You look great in that outfit today. Is it Anna's latest haute couture design? I envy you. You're pregnant and still managing to keep your figure. Unlike me, I've swollen up trying to hold onto this child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head, looking at Giselle with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been hostile towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet today, she suddenly changed her tune, incessantly complimenting me in front of Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did pigs just start flying? Or did she hold onto that baby for too long and lose her mind?" I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, do you need something?" I interrupted her chatter coldly, not interested in her nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my impatience, Giselle finally approached. Right in front of me, she took Elliott's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I think now that you've found your happiness. Elliott and I are also very happy. We do not need to be at odds, don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was deliberately displaying her affection with Elliott in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave her a cold glance and said, "I never wanted to be at odds with you. Aren't you the one who has always been targeting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, Madeline needs to rest. You should go lie down," Elliott finally pushed Giselle away impatiently, then said to her coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, why don't you tell Madeline about our engagement? I think she'd be happy for us. Right, Madeline?" Giselle stumbled back a few steps, finally regaining her balance, then looked at Elliott pitifully and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned, thinking, "So, all those words she said earlier were to tell me that Elliott is going to engage with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Congratulations to you both." I pretended to be unaffected, looking calmly at the two before me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly stood up, his voice booming. "You better go lie down! Don't wait until you start bleeding again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle pretended to look aggrieved, staring with her large eyes, but the sparkle that once inhabited them seemed to have vanished. Instead, her eye bags accentuated her lack of vitality, making her appear malnourished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she probably still thought of herself as beautiful. She clutched onto Elliott's sleeve. "But the doctor said you should start talking to the baby from now on. It's time for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was feeble as if she might run out of breath at any moment, sending shivers down my spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately placed Elliott's hand on her abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glanced down at her belly, his cold expression softening slightly and his tone becoming gentler. "Alright, you go back first. I'll come over in a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll wait for you then. Madeline, I'll head to the ward first. You rest well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle waved at me and left. Now, it was just Elliott and me in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat back down, seeming like he wanted to explain, hesitating before he spoke, "She's been having irregular bleeding lately. The doctor says it's related to her depressed mood. To calm her down, I promised we'd get engaged once the baby was born. Grandpa is currently in the ICU. The doctors say he might not have more than six months left, and he's waiting for this child to be born."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="567.html">« Prev</a><a href="569.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
