However, I do not wish for my pregnancy to draw any attention from others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn also rarely dressed up that day. He seldom wore suits, so every time he did, it was a sight to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed a handsome young man. The black suit complemented his fair skin. The stand-up collar style accentuated his slender neck. He gently tapped the steering wheel, with a smile in his eyes, looking at me. The air of nobility that he had developed growing up in a prominent family made people feel comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't notice before, but today I suddenly noticed that his fingers were really slender and looked clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why were you suddenly staring at me in a daze?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn noticed that I had been staring at him and asked me with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing. I'm used to seeing you with a tough look. Suddenly dressing so formally, you look quite handsome," I casually remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? If I remember correctly, this is the first time you have praised me like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn laughed immediately. When he laughed, his eyes curved and looked very attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your handsomeness is a fact. It doesn't need to be mentioned often. However, it's such a pity that such a handsome man doesn't have a girlfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I joked. Originally, I was just kidding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unexpectedly, Quinn suddenly held the steering wheel with one hand and grasped my cold fingers with the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said I didn't have a girlfriend? Aren't you my girlfriend? If you say such things again, be careful, I will punish you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's sudden intimate gesture startled me, causing my whole body to tremble for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart was pounding uncontrollably, and my face instantly turned red. I instinctively wanted to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, some things should not be said casually. You clearly know that we were just acting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it was you who has been acting all along. Not me." Quinn's tone suddenly turned serious. He grabbed my hand, and his gaze still fixed ahead. He added, "I was just waiting for you to completely let go of Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this a sudden love confession?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was also too sudden, catching me off guard. In an instant, I felt my hand held by him go numb, not daring to move at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, why are you suddenly saying these things?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle is no longer a barrier between you and Elliott, so I'm afraid you and Elliott will reconcile. Last night, I had a dream where you were walking towards me in a wedding dress. I felt so happy. But suddenly, the groom turned into Elliott, and I was </span><span>pushed down by you. It was at that moment of awakening that I realized, I wasn't acting, I was..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn calmly said as he drove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I understood the sentence he was about to say, I was extremely scared in my heart, so I hurriedly interrupted him and said seriously,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I am your friend. We could have been anything to each other, but never lovers. I had a child. How could I burden you? I know what you want to say, but please don't say it!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="664.html">« Prev</a><a href="666.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
