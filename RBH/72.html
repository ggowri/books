She wore long fringe earrings, thick makeup, and a well-tailored suit. She looked very wealthy. The strong scent of her perfume made me frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, who do you want to recommend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already brought the person to you. She has also had a hit drama in the film and television industry. She is quite famous. The most important thing is that her asking price this time is not high, and we can definitely afford it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade finished speaking and clapped three times. Then, a woman wearing a black dress and with wavy curly hair walked into my office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment when our eyes met, both I and the other person were at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that the person recommended to me by Jade would actually be Sylvia. And Sylvia obviously didn't expect that I was the hidden financial backer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade, she really seemed to be afraid that the world would not be in chaos?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she really not know about those rumors about Sylvia and Elliott, or was she deliberately pushing Sylvia in front of me to provoke me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly turned black-faced. I coldly said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jade, is this the candidate you want to recommend? Sorry, she is not quite suitable. She was too old and too ugly. Moreover, she does not fit my vision for the female lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Sylvia, I did not give her a single pleasant expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia's face darkened instantly. She instinctively wanted to come forward and argue with me. However, Jade stood in front of her, smiling warmly and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this be? Ms. Hart is only 26 years old. She looks older because of her mature appearance. But good actors can change their makeup according to the role. Ms. Hart really wants to be in this play. And she is willing to lower her salary. Madeline, just consider it, after all, Ms. Hart has won some awards before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what Jade's purpose was. I had refused so clearly, yet she still went all out to recommend Sylvia to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Sylvia. To my surprise, compared to the previous tension, this woman seemed much more submissive this time, with lowered brows and a docile demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped forward and forced a smile as she said to me, "Ms. Mayers, can I talk to you alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like we didn't have much to talk about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I coldly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she pleaded with me in a begging tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't take up too much of your time. Moreover, I think there might be some misunderstandings between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Misunderstanding?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the misunderstanding she referred to about Elliott and her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it's about this matter, then I would like to hear what she really wants to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then I'll give you ten minutes. Adam, you go out with Ms. Jade Mayers first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at my watch. Then, I said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam and Jade immediately left my office and closed the office door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia pulled the chair in front of me and sat down. I noticed that compared to her previous vibrant self, her complexion now appeared noticeably tired. Even with a thick layer of makeup, it couldn't conceal the fatigue evident on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked down at the documents. I saw that she remained silent. So, I casually said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you want to tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively swept the curls on her left side behind her ear. Then, she cleared her throat and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, I know you have always misunderstood my relationship with Mr. Bryant. You thought we were really like what was written in those news articles, but in reality, we were not. Mr. Bryant... has always kept his distance from me."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="71.html">« Prev</a><a href="73.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
