On the cabinet next to the bed, there was an exquisite fruit basket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you are here! " Quinn stood up immediately when he saw me and ran towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He subconsciously looked at me from top to bottom with his eyes fixed on my neck. Then the smile on his face was eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know the reason. But suddenly I realized that Elliott had sucked my neck so wildly last night. So he may leave some marks on my neck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On my way home, I didn't have time to focus on my appearance, and just casually wore a low-necked sweater and a goose-yellow down jacket. Then I rushed to the hospital to see my dad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed the mark on my neck. As an adult, he understood what had happened to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, feeling embarrassed for a moment and not knowing what to say. He remained silent for a while, and then he suddenly smiled, "It seems that I worried too much last night. I thought... Just let it go. It's nice to see you are fine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I..." I knew that he had stayed up late all night because he was worried about me. So I felt sorry for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Laura came to visit your dad just now. And this fruit basket is her gift. " My mother said this sentence to break the awkwardness between me and Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard her words, my heart suddenly sank.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura did come to this hospital. So it seemed that the figures I met with Paige were indeed her and Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, is she alone?" I asked quickly and stepped forward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She came with the girl that came here last time. The girl seemed very close to her. She said the girl was her goddaughter. Madeline, Laura didn't tell you that she has come to the hospital? " My mother asked with suspicion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that she came here with Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. Did she say anything?" I shook my head and asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother looked at me in surprise and then said, "She just asked about your dad's health. Then she asked me why you didn't come. Madeline, are you having a great relationship with the Bryant family now? "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother was always sensitive. She must have noticed something, so she asked me these questions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it's okay. Don't worry. By the way, Elliott wants to transfer Dad to the Bryant Hospital. He will arrange a joint consultation with authoritative doctors to find out the causes of the disease. Do you agree? " I asked my mother quickly after I settled down her doubts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to the Bryant Hospital? Are there any better doctors over there? " When my mother heard what I said, she asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I have made arrangements. The ward and doctors are top-notch, Mom!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before finishing answering her questions, the door suddenly opened and Elliott walked in.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="340.html">« Prev</a><a href="342.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
