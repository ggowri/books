I was exhausted and couldn't speak a word.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had said all the love words in my heart countless times. And in that diary, I expressed my love for him more than once. If he had read that diary, he would naturally understand all my love for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I want him to slowly understand by himself the deep affection I had for him in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, I felt his passion so strongly that my heart, which was once extremely cold, felt warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This night, Elliott indulged me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My body and heart were opened by him. I was growing to trust him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just when we were completely immersed in joy, Elliott's phone rang suddenly late at night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in high spirits, only glanced at it briefly, and then threw the phone further away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After turning over, we continued.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the other party kept calling as if there was something urgent. The cell phone rang again and again, which gradually cooled down our extremely excited mood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe anyone has something urgent to ask you, you should answer it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stroked Elliott's face and said softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned, glanced at the phone, and finally took it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the phone screen and saw the words "Giselle".</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott picked up the phone, and there was a trace of impatience in his hoarse voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so late, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, are you in Louis City? Are you with Madeline now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Giselle asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get to the point!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone became increasingly impatient.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he looked at me underneath him and suddenly moved twice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect he would suddenly move, so I was so shocked that I let out a low cry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you are now with Madeline, right? I just seemed to hear a woman's voice..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Giselle's voice grew louder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From her tone, it seemed that she was the wife who called to question Elliott, while I was Elliott's mistress in secret.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation was so familiar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This seemed to be a replay of what happened last life, but this time, I exchanged identity with Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was now the hysterical woman, and I was enjoying all Elliott's love in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there is nothing else, I will hang up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott apparently too lazy to talk to her, so he hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid being disturbed again, Elliott simply turned off the phone. Then, he immediately rushed over and pressed me on the bed again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His indifferent attitude toward Giselle made me secretly happy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I licked his lips with the tip of my tongue and took the initiative to lift my waist to kiss his Adam's apple.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked down at me with desire in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so charming."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tonight, you can do whatever you want." I smiled charmingly.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="286.html">« Prev</a><a href="288.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
