Immediately, I felt a strong hand gripping my arm tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, hold on, it's me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice, incredibly familiar, whispered in my ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The actions, the sounds, everything felt like a replay of a past life. It seemed as though I had experienced this before, and now I was reliving it once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The icy seawater stung my eyes, making it impossible to open them. I tried several times to see the face of the person rescuing me, but no matter what, I couldn't make out the features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could only sense strongly that a great force was pulling me forward. After a while, the water around me finally turned into solid ground, as if I had been placed on a small boat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seawater on my face and body was quickly wiped dry by someone. I tried to open my eyes but found myself too weak to even muster the strength to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, my mind was unusually clear. I could feel the boat rocking, and more importantly, I could sense someone holding me tightly, calling my name, urging me to open my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a daze, I heard him shouting, "Madeline, I will never let the accident of the past life happen again..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the last sentence I faintly heard before losing consciousness. However, the roaring of the waves and the sea breeze were too loud for me to hear clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I woke up again, I found myself in a luxurious room, dressed in clean and dry clothes, with my hair also dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything felt like a dream. If not for the soreness in my body, I would have almost believed that none of it had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened my eyes, propping myself up on the bed, trying to sit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps my voice disturbed the person waiting in the room, as I saw a tall figure rushing over, placing a pillow under my head after supporting my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was unusually gentle. "Madeline, you're finally awake. You scared me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn?" I stared at the man in front of me, surprised, and asked, "How come it's you? Where am I now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly knew what I was most concerned about, immediately reassuring me, "Still on the yacht, you fell into the sea, but luckily I arrived in time to save you. Don't worry, both you and the child are fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "The child is fine, that's a stroke of luck in misfortune."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing his words, I quickly touched my abdomen, then asked him in surprise, "But how did you come to the yacht?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said, "I saw Auntie Grey bring you here, which made me furious. Worried about you, I directly took a small boat to find you. I didn't expect to see you fall into the water as soon as I arrived, fortunately I made it in time. By the way, why did you fall into the water?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his question, I suddenly recalled what happened before I fell into the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, I became agitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly asked him, "Where is Philip now?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="576.html">« Prev</a><a href="578.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
