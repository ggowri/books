His drive and decision-making skills were top-notch, so when it came to competing with him for business, I had to be quick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob quickly glanced through the contract and, after confirming that there were no issues, he immediately signed it on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately called the financial staff of Glory Group and transferred the first payment of three million dollars directly into Jacob's account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jacob was delighted with my straightforwardness. After receiving the first payment, he left contentedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put the contract in my bag and was about to leave the private room when Elliott turned back. What surprised me was that he came back alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the private room, except for me, there was only the leftover food on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Jacob?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over and frowned at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, he has already left."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I answered casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know what I was going to talk to him about? You just let him go so easily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned and coldly interrogated me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what you were going to talk about with him, but anyway, I already had a deal with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Elliott and said calmly with my hands folded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What could you talk to him about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Elliott was still unaware of the problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's the copyright of 'Do Not Love'. I have already negotiated and successfully signed the contract with him on behalf of Glory Group. Our agreement is already in effect. I know you wanted to tailor this drama for your lover, but I'm sorry, you'll have to look for other scripts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I patted Elliott's shoulder and revealed this news to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face instantly darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? Madeline, are you here tonight to steal my business?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations, you're right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why, but my aesthetic has changed now, and I actually liked to see him angry more and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott roared in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed me against the wall, and then he grabbed my chin, staring at me with a cold gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This drama was my cup of tea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what? I had already signed the contract with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took out the contract and proudly waved it in my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snatched the contract and tore it to pieces right in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I have never failed to get what I set my eyes on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was no use tearing it. The contract has already been filed by the Legal Department, and the first payment has been deposited into Jacob's account. I'm sorry, but the contract has already taken effect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the president and understood the principle that once a contract took effect, it could not be changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, he also knew that this matter could not be undone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were icy cold. Based on my past experience, he was already on the verge of exploding in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you are the first one who snatched business from my hands all these years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, his voice deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are husband and wife. It doesn't matter who earns the money. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blinked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed my collar, forcing me to tiptoe and meet his gaze. Our faces were so close that I could smell the familiar scent of his cologne on him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="25.html">« Prev</a><a href="27.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
