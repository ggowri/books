You had no right to interfere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to say anything more to him. So, I hung up the phone directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, my mood inexplicably became irritable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why do I still care so much about his every move?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could completely ignore and easily handle everything he did before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why, as soon as Giselle appeared, did I feel like I was back in that state of being overly concerned about Elliott, just like before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly was I still caring about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shouldn't I have already let go of all this a long time ago?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Giselle's appearance suddenly expose my true feelings for him? Am I really that vulnerable?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was lost in my thoughts in my head. However, the more I thought, the more my head started to ache. I shook my head and stopped thinking. I opened the door and was about to walk out. I didn't expect Quinn to appear at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you woke up, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn saw me, he paused for a moment and then he laughed heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um. Thank you for last night. How much were the phone and clothes? I'll transfer the money to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With our relationship, it seems strange for you to say that. Do I really need you to transfer this small amount of money to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn blinked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's our relationship, Mr. Woods? If I remember correctly, you used to dislike me a lot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was amused by Quinn's remarks. So, I couldn't help but tease back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, people change. Haven't you changed too?" Quinn laughed again. He reached out and affectionately patted my head, "After you got drunk last night, you said a lot of nonsense. Do you remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is evident that I drank too much last night. This caused me to completely forget what happened afterward. I only remember that I and him drank a lot of alcohol at his club. I remember that we both played dice. I remember him carrying me... I can no longer remember what happened afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did I say? Quinn, did I say something I shouldn't have?" I asked skeptically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said it. You said quite a lot. I even recorded it. You better treat me better in the future. Otherwise, I will spread all the things you said!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did I say? Where is the recording? Let me listen to it-"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I heard his words, I immediately became anxious. Subconsciously, I reached out my hand, wanting to snatch his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held the phone high above his head. Quinn and Elliott were about the same height. They were both tall, standing at over 6ft. Even if I tiptoed or jumped to reach, I still couldn't reach the phone in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was clearly teasing me on purpose. I tried to grab him a few times, but he skillfully dodged each attempt. This made me so angry that I couldn't help but angrily slap his chest. And he just laughed heartily in response. His infectious laughter echoed throughout the entire hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, hurry up and let me listen to what you recorded?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait until you snatch the phone, then I'll let you listen. You little dwarf."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you were just a shorty. Your whole family was shorties. I was freaking 5.6ft. I was not short at all, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are not short, how could you not reach my phone? Are you too clumsy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's continuous teasing made me suddenly lose all interest. I shouted out his name loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I stood still in the same spot. My emotions plummeted to the bottom. I no longer had any intention to continue fooling around with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably sensed my emotions all of a sudden. So, he also instantly became serious. Then, he opened the empty recording software on his phone and said to me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I lied to you. I didn't record anything. You didn't say anything you shouldn't have last night, so don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he didn't have a recording, why did he just lie to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but glare at him fiercely. Then, I took the lead and stepped into the elevator. But to my surprise, at the moment when the elevator door was about to close, he actually squeezed in forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, you said you didn't care about Elliott, but you still cared about him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the cramped elevator, Quinn suddenly said these words. It was as if he had already seen through all of my thoughts.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="62.html">« Prev</a><a href="64.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
