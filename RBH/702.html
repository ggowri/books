Now that he has started to cherish me, I will come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea at all how a woman's heart gradually turns cold, let alone the extent of the damage he had caused me with everything he had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I calmly and honestly revealed everything, as I looked directly into his eyes. At that moment, my nose felt a bit sour, and I instinctively wanted to shed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I shed enough tears for this love. Now, I don't want to show any emotions in front of Elliott anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I didn't want him to know, I still cared about his hurt in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There is no need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This relationship, which has lasted for over ten years until now, had no turning back the moment I decided to let go completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman sometimes needs a man, just like a paratrooper needs a parachute when landing. If that man doesn't show up at that moment, then for the rest of her life, she doesn't need him to appear again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You see, you haven't even thought about this question," I sneered and laughed. As I finished speaking, I instinctively pressed my hand against the car's handle, preparing to get off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I admit, I had never thought about these things before, and you had never mentioned them to me either. Madeline, give me some time, I need to think about it carefully," murmured Elliott behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was no longer condescending, his confidence had weakened significantly. It was evident that he was still shaken inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else is there to think about? The answer is already very clear. For so many years, from the beginning to the end, you have never said 'I love you' to me, until now. Your feelings toward me are still not love. So, let go, and let's leave each other with a little dignity." I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't look back. After saying these words, I immediately pushed open the car door </span><span>and jumped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hurriedly came out of the restaurant at that moment, looking around anxiously with a worried expression on his face. And behind him, Barry followed closely, grabbing his arm, seemingly desperately trying to stop Marcus from finding me, getting closer to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at this scene and found it somewhat funny at first glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was not the kind of person who was smooth in handling things. He was rigid and robotic, following Elliott's orders without hesitation. His clumsy and determined way of pulling Marcus along was quite amusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to stop Mr. Brown anymore, I have finished talking with your master," I stepped forward and said to Barry calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was taken aback and instinctively let go of Marcus's hand. He looked around and saw that his master hadn't even gotten out of the car. His face appeared very confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, let's go," I shook my head at Marcus, signaling him to leave with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you okay? Did he hurt you?" Marcus freed himself from Barry's grip and immediately approached me, supporting me with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, but you, did you not get dragged by that idiot?" I teased intentionally, while giving Barry a disdainful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry stood still, looking flustered and innocent under my teasing, with a handsome yet dumbfounded expression, which was quite amusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to enjoy teasing him before, but now seeing him like this, I couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... no." Marcus was initially taken aback by my question, but quickly caught on. "I'm glad you're okay. I was afraid he would do something to you, so I kept trying to chase after him. But this guy, he desperately held onto me and wouldn't let go. It made everyone in the restaurant think we were a couple. I was truly speechless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. Clearly, he had just been messed around by Barry enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is quite rare for him to be so furious, considering his usual composure.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="701.html">« Prev</a><a href="703.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
