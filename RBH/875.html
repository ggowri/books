I know you've been eyeing that woman, I've been watching her too. She's been making waves in the social circles of Hoswich city lately. I had someone dig into her background. Her family is massive, with a strong foothold in Onastin. But she's just an illegitimate daughter. Rumor has it that she was brought home by her father when she was six, and the rest of the family doesn't really care for her. They just keep their mouths shut out of respect for her father. He has three sons, and she's his only daughter, so he's always doted on her. Her brothers may not be close to her, but given the limited inheritance a daughter can receive in their family, they've mostly kept the peace with her. I see their family has set up a branch in Hoswich now, with her leading the charge. I reckon her father intends for her to take over in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey filled me in on all the background info she'd dug up on Lisa Fox.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her, a hint of confusion in my eyes, and asked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grey, why are you telling me all this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flashed a seductive smile, playfully tapped my nose, and boldly planted a kiss on my face, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, you've been staring at her non-stop, it's pretty obvious. She looks so much like you, and now she's making waves in Hoswich City, you're definitely intrigued, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey indeed has a knack for reading between the lines.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've indeed been keeping tabs on her. I can't quite figure out what she's up to, there's something enigmatic about her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a nod, admitting it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's ambitious, a social butterfly, and quite open with the opposite sex. A few of Hoswich city's rich kids are already head over heels for her. She's also managed to establish business relations with several companies, including your ex-husband's."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey said with a meaningful smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had already filled me in, his collaboration with Lisa Fox was a way of repaying her father's kindness from years ago. So, I wasn't surprised by it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grey, if you ever dig up any more info about her, make sure you let me know!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, I caught sight of Laura Bryant, swathed in a vintage-style gown, making her entrance surrounded by a gaggle of friends.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon spotting Laura, Lisa Fox instantly ditched her newly-acquired friends, fluttering towards Laura like a butterfly. Lisa ingratiatingly said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, I never pegged you as the type to enjoy such parties. You're so youthful at heart."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She meant to compliment, but unexpectedly, it upset Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scowl etched on her face, Laura declared:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're saying we're too old to attend such parties?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, that's not what I meant, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Lisa was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Laura Bryant spotted me. Her face lit up with joy, and without a second thought for Lisa, she headed straight towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you're at the party too. Did you come alone?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she asked me, her eyes darted around, curious to see who I'd bring to this occasion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She doesn't need to say it, I already know. She definitely wants to see Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I responded with a cool indifference.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, she seemed oblivious to my coldness. She took my hand intimately, her eyes crinkling in a warm smile as she said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect timing, I have a few friends over today. Let me introduce you. They're all distinguished ladies of Hoswich city, not the type to mingle with just anyone. Come along, Madeline!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on," Laura said, tugging me towards her friend.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Grey grabbed my other hand, his voice firm as he said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="874.html">« Prev</a><a href="876.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
