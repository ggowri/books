Besides, the Bryant family has really gone too far. You know, Giselle has been flaunting her pregnancy everywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona said again, somewhat irritably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because that woman is flaunting everywhere, now that Madeline is pregnant, she can't lose to her even more. Moreover, Elliott's heart is still with Madeline now, so I think she still has the upper hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige protested, feeling indignant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop arguing, you two. I've already made up my mind to get divorced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, I had slowly detached myself from the emotions of a moment ago. After calming down, I reiterated my determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my words, Fiona immediately raised her hands in support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's great that you've made up your mind! I don't want to see you wavering for this man anymore. A truly reliable man wouldn't keep his partner in such a state of uncertainty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige couldn't help but sigh again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, Madeline, you need to think it through. Once you're divorced, you'll have to live alone with the child. That will be very difficult."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said calmly, feeling more determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just then, my phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the phone, only to be surprised to find that it was Elliott calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the name on the phone screen, my once firm heart suddenly became confused again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a while, I still answered the call. And the moment I picked up the phone, I heard Elliott's extremely hoarse and low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I'm sick..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gasped for breath, my heart tightening, but I involuntarily responded coldly, "If you're sick, go see a doctor. I can't cure you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you? I want to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hoarse voice came again, accompanied by a few violent coughs. It sounded like he was really sick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clenched my lips tightly. Every cough of his made my heart tremble. Despite that, I deliberately maintained a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should focus on getting better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see you, Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He repeated this sentence again, with an unprecedented urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the video Paige had just shown me, I could imagine what he looked like now lying in the hospital bed calling me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt soft-hearted again, but just then, Fiona snatched my phone directly. Without waiting for me to say anything, she immediately hung up the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop hesitating. Since you've decided to move forward, Madeline, stay firm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona said, afraid that I would become entangled again, and made the decision for me directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and grabbed the coffee on the table, which had cooled down, and drank it in one gulp. It was only then that I realized how bitter the coffee was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We chatted in the coffee shop for a long time before we finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I drove home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom called to say she was making roasted sandwiches for dinner and asked me to come home early to help. I happily agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as I parked the car at the door, I saw two people getting out of a black commercial vehicle parked at my door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that these two people, one wearing a patient gown with an IV drip on his hand, was Elliott, and the other was Barry, who was holding the IV bag high for him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in his condition, he came to wait for me at my doorstep?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he crazy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt very confused and just stood there in a daze...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="466.html">« Prev</a><a href="468.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
