He snatched the phone from my hand and said coldly, "Giselle, I always thought you were innocent. I never imagined you were like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I can explain. What I said just now was out of anger. It's because..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's voice on the other end of the phone was trembling by now. She desperately shouted into the phone, but Elliott had impatiently hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed the phone back to me, looking at me with an unprecedented hint of guilt in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slight smirk still lingered on my face. I didn't want to say much more, so I turned around and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke behind me. "Signing with Jezebel was indeed her recommendation. But, what I considered was Jezebel's personal value. Her recommendation was only a small part of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stopped in my tracks, not turning around. I couldn't help but sneer, "You don't have to justify yourself to me. We both know how it works in the business world. There is no room for sentimentality. You've made that clear, and so have I. It's alright. If you're itching for a competition, let's settle it once and for all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just said I didn't mean to compete with you. It's just..." Elliott still wanted to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I couldn't be bothered to listen anymore. I cut him off directly. "That's enough. Let's drop the pretense between us. I've known you for so many years. In the business world, you play hardball, regardless of who's on the other side. And I'm cut from the same cloth, too. Elliott, it's every man for himself.&nbsp;I don't need you to go easy on me. Just bring your A-game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these cold words, I left Serenity Villa without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I was leaving Serenity Villa in a taxi, I received a text message from Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Alright. If you're up for the challenge, our game is officially on.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at the message, smiling bitterly. "I knew it. Elliott couldn't be genuinely soft-hearted, ready to let go of any of his business plans for the sake of mere emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But perhaps this was for the best. It meant that from then on, he truly saw me as his opponent, not just a woman needing his constant concessions. For him, this game began now, but for me, it had started long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Ken messaged me: [The first wave of materials is out. Check Twitter. It's about to blow up.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled involuntarily and opened Twitter. As expected, the dirt on Jezebel had already hit the trending list, alongside the news of Allure landing a deal with Netflix. And the comments about Jezebel were all negative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken wasn't just a seasoned entertainment journalist. He was also a master at leaks and manipulating online buzz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly sent Ken a thumbs-up emoji.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied with a smirk emoji: [Don't count your chickens before they hatch. The real show is yet to come. Just sit tight, and I'll blow your mind!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken's tone was reminiscent of our days battling it out in games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With him orchestrating everything behind the scenes, I had nothing to worry about.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="415.html">« Prev</a><a href="417.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
