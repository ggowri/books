Let's leave the past behind. In the future, let's be friends, shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Sylvia and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I didn't know much about her, I was just in love with Elliott at that time. So, seeing this woman with exaggerated and provocative attire made me angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After truly understanding Giselle, I realized that women who dress extravagantly are not necessarily deceitful, and women who dress simply are not necessarily innocent. Sometimes, one cannot judge a person's true nature solely based on their appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We actually didn't have any problems before. Did you really think there was any kind of emotional connection between me and Elliott? Let me tell you, back then we were just acting, nothing actually happened. Sometimes I even feel like he was just using me, deliberately making you feel uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After knowing that her face would not be disfigured, Sylvia felt much relieved. She leaned back on the hospital bed and explained to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened? The Elliott back then, he didn't really seem like such an honest person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I, however, half believed her words. Despite this, Elliott had also provided an explanation for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, during that time, Elliott was almost always with Sylvia, even sharing many intimate photos. Moreover, he showed no interest in me at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was not sure about his relationship with other people, but during the time we were together, nothing happened between us. However, now everything is in the past, and talking about it doesn't make any sense. You're right. We can say we had no discord, no concord. If you don't mind, I would be happy to be friends with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Sylvia finished speaking, she sincerely reached out her hand to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect it, but today's little incident actually made Sylvia and me put aside our previous grievances and become friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Sylvia and I shook hands and made peace, the door of the ward was suddenly kicked open by someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before we could react, Elliott was standing outside the door, gripping Nicole's collar. His handsome face was as cold as thick winter snow, and his dark eyes held a strong chill. He glanced briefly at the ward and remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't Nicole get taken away by the police?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does he want by suddenly dragging her here now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I frowned and watched this scene, feeling somewhat puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, Elliott suddenly grabbed Nicole's collar and pushed her forcefully. Nicole groaned in pain and immediately fell to her knees on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could react, Elliott had already approached. He lowered his head and stared at Nicole coldly, with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you cause trouble right under my nose? You must be crazy. Apologize immediately! Apologize to Madeline right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared loudly. His cold and cruel appearance, completely different from the impression I had of him, shocked me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="674.html">« Prev</a><a href="676.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
