I followed Quinn out of the car and into his club.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ushered me into his private room. Knowing my somber mood, he uncorked a bottle of red wine and instructed the waiter to request the kitchen to prepare some delectable dishes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about I drink some wine with you tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he had insight into all my thoughts. Quinn was always by my side, considerately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was really depressed, so before the waiter served the food, I poured a glass of red wine and drank it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I was the first to drink a glass, Quinn also poured a glass of wine and clinked the glasses with me. Then, he said slowly, "I heard from Fiona that you agreed with Elliott to prepare for pregnancy with him. Madeline, tell me the truth. Are you still in love with him? In fact, subconsciously, you are not trying to get back at him but trying to be with him. So, the test results disappoint you, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking cunningly into my eyes, he seemed to read my mind. I had to face my true thoughts, nodded subconsciously, and then shook my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible for me not to care about him. I've loved him for so many years, and I can't forget him immediately. I admit that when he treats me well, I'm still attracted to him. However, I feel even more reluctant. Quinn, Quinn, it's hard to put into words, but I'm acutely aware that Giselle will become the most important person to Elliott and will eventually replace me. But I am not reluctant to be replaced by her. I am not sure if you understand me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drinking a glass of wine, I mustered up the courage to tell Quinn my biggest secret.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't explain to him why I was so sure. After all, the notion of rebirth seemed utterly far-fetched, something confined to the realm of fiction for most people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to my surprise, when I said these words, Quinn showed no doubts. On the contrary, he seemed happy. With bright eyes, he looked sincere and friendly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You may think I'm clueless, but Madeline, I understand you more deeply than anyone else in this world, even more so than your parents, friends, and Elliott."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His extremely determined tone surprised me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, even in his silence, I always sensed his understanding, and it ran deep. Despite withholding many details, he had a knack for deciphering my innermost thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in my previous life, I had no interaction with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;I could not figure out what was going on, but it was very touching to have a close friend like Quinn.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Quinn. In fact, I know that even if I'm not ill, Elliott and I will inevitably divorce. Yet, I refuse to accept that fate. I would like to take a chance. I wish to alter my destiny. I want him to love me as deeply as I love him rather than lavishing the affection I crave on Giselle."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="258.html">« Prev</a><a href="260.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
