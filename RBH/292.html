Otherwise, they will be heartless."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The message was sent by Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was really ridiculous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She now even spoke for Laura. Laura asked Giselle to tell me what she wanted to tell me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need you to inform me whether I should divorce or not."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reply quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then replied quickly with a righteous tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should know what's going on with your body, right? You've lost your fertility. Being Elliott's wife will only intensify his family's dislike of you. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her words and couldn't help but sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even though I was sneering, I had to admit that what she said was indeed true.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disgust Elliott's family had towards me in my previous life was also caused by my later inability to have children.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, I thought I would be better if I stayed away from those diet pills. Unexpectedly, God was still so cruel and still deprived me of the ability to have children. This seemed to be a joke played by God on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's family was so disgusted with me now. They might use all kinds of means to force me to divorce.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Giselle was eager to take my place, I felt a strong unwillingness in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was unwilling to succumb to fate like this, so I quickly went out and got medicine from Patrick in Louis City, and then returned to the set to make arrangements for the rest of the work. After that, I drove back to Hoswich.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I went directly to the Bryant family's hospital and wanted to visit Cormac.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what I didn't expect was that when I arrived at Cormac's VIP ward, Giselle suddenly came and blocked my way with two people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here? You are not welcome here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle saw the red mark on my neck at a glance, and a strong jealousy flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way, it's not your turn to stop me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that she would be so arrogant now. I was so angry that I immediately pushed her away and tried to break in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, two strong bodyguards behind her immediately stopped me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle said coldly, "Cormac was finally rescued successfully, and now Elliott and his parents were all accompanying Cormac. If you go in at this time, Cormac faints from anger again, can you take the responsibility?
