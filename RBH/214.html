By the time I reacted, I had already been pushed aside by her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott only cared about Cormac at that time. He immediately stepped forward to hold Cormac's hand and asked, "Grandpa, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you're here. Giselle is also here. Thank you, Giselle."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac had just finished the operation, but he was still conscious. Seeing Elliott and Giselle there, he smiled subconsciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cormac, you finally came out. I was very worried about you. Fortunately, the doctor said you are fine now," Giselle instantly came forward to hold Cormac's hand and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, please let the patient go back to the ward to rest. You can talk to him later, okay?" the doctor urged.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, everyone else immediately made way for Cormac.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the doctor pushed Cormac towards the ward, Elliott finally noticed me in the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly waved to me to come to him and said to Cormac, "Grandpa, Madeline came to see you, too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stepped forward, knowing that Giselle wanted to get closer to Elliott, but I stood between them, so she had to move to the side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cormac, are you feeling better? As soon as I heard that you fell, I and Elliott immediately returned from Louis City."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked forward and held Cormac's hand gently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw me, he wasn't as happy as he just saw Elliott and Giselle. Instead, he just nodded slightly and said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood that Cormac was not very satisfied with me, not to mention that I didn't have much communication with him in the past, and I hadn't conceived a child yet. All these things would make Cormac not like me that much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that Giselle visited Cormac so often and happened to save him this time. It seemed that no matter how cautious I had been about her, she could always find ways to approach all the members of the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made me even more sure about Giselle's intentions towards Elliot. She was not as innocent as she looked like.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We accompanied Cormac to the ward. The doctor only allowed a maximum of two family members to stay with the patient because Cormac needed to rest quietly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle volunteered and said, "Let me stay here and take care of Cormac. I used to work as a part-time nurse in a hospital and have nursing experience. You can go back and have a rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura said, "Giselle, you've done so much today. You should go back and rest early. I will take care of him here. Moreover, we've hired caregivers, and they'll do their job."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seemed that Giselle didn't want to give up this opportunity to leave a good impression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she added, "But Laura, you are very tired. I'm still young and not tired, so just let me stay here. Or Madeline can stay here with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea what Giselle was thinking about. Seeing me standing aside without saying a word, she suddenly asked me to stay, too.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="213.html">« Prev</a><a href="215.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
