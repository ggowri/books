It's just the way it is, making movies requires mingling with all sorts of people. And truth be told, Mr. Rodr&iacute;guez was a huge help in making this shoot in Mexico a success."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton said with a hint of helplessness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, understanding his helplessness, and chose not to say anything more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after what just happened, I've lost all interest in attending the party.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott could tell I was worn out. He took my hand and led me out to the balcony for a breather.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing here, too?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked, a hint of confusion lacing my voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dalton sent an invitation to the Bryant Group. I knew he was working with you, figured you'd be here, so I came. Good thing I did, who knows what could have happened just now. Madeline, is your head still hurting? Do you need to go to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the secluded balcony, Elliott's voice was notably hushed. He looked at me with a concerned gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It wasn't too painful, but that guy was seriously like a mobster. I hope I never run into him again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The events that just transpired still leave a sour taste in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mexico is currently cracking down hard on the underground black market. This guy seems to be trying to clean up his act, otherwise he wouldn't be facilitating your movie. He's been in town, meeting with a lot of the bigwigs in Hoswich city, looking to do legitimate business. He's even approached me, a referral from Lisa."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly brought up Lisa, and I couldn't help but feel a slight jolt in my heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa, there she was again...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This woman exudes an air of mystery, her true intentions remaining elusive. Moreover, ever since her arrival, a myriad of events seem to be inexplicably linked to her presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Lisa close with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lisa mentioned that her aunt married Diego Rodr&iacute;guez," he began. "Diego was once a poor man, just a small-time trader. But somehow, he stumbled upon an opportunity that catapulted his business to great heights, and his influence grew with it. He's known to hold a grudge, but don't worry, I won't let anyone harm you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott must have done some digging on Diego Rodr&iacute;guez, and he spilled everything he knew to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rarely used to share everything with me like this before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I'm increasingly able to sense his sincerity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to associate with such people. I hope today is the last time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a slight nod.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott ruffled my hair, then smoothly pulled me into his embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A full moon hung in the sky, casting a delicate silver veil over the earth. Nestled in Elliott's arms, I could hear his strong heartbeat once again, and it left me feeling somewhat dazed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're feeling tired, we can let Dalton know. I can take you home early."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott murmured softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held me in his arms, his hand still cradling my head. I could feel his concern.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="853.html">« Prev</a><a href="855.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
