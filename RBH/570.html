I simply shared my firsthand experiences in business. Alongside imparting wisdom, I also discussed my insights into future business trends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, my speech captured the attention of numerous ambitious youths, who eagerly shared it across the web.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea who had dubbed me the "queen-like CEO," but soon, that title resonated widely online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of dissemination on the internet was simply astonishing. My online fame not only boosted the Glory Group's market value several folds but also distinguished it from the traditional companies in Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, countless companies clamored to collaborate with the Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like a spinning top, constantly in motion, with endless clients to meet and meetings to attend. Yet, I relished this bustling lifestyle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One afternoon, as I concluded a meeting, someone called out to me in the hotel corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, wait up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, I turned around to find Grey, whom I'd briefly met before and who happened to be Quinn's aunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in professional attire, she stood gracefully before me. I halted, pleasantly surprised, and greeted her. "Mrs. Woods, it's you? Are you here for a meeting, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey stepped forward, affectionately taking my hand and smiling, "We're family now. Why are you still calling me Mrs. Woods? You should call me Auntie Grey, just like Quinn does."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took me a moment to process. Grey must have heard something from Quinn's parents and mistakenly assumed Quinn and I were a couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I awkwardly chuckled but had to go along with her suggestion, "Auntie Grey, what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here with my husband for client reception. I stepped out for some fresh air and ran into you. Your speech was fantastic, especially your insights into the value that business brings to women, which were very thought-provoking. You truly are a clear-headed and independent woman. Quinn has good taste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey had actually watched my speech and generously praised me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a bit embarrassed by her compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just speaking from the heart, sharing my inner feelings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you did it so well, and your presence was commanding. Even Quinn's parents couldn't stop praising you. I never imagined that Quinn, who's so carefree, would end up with such an outstanding wife. By the way, are you free tonight? There's a top-tier socialite party happening on a yacht in Hoswich. The guests are all elite socialites from the upper echelons of Hoswich. Several of them expressed interest in meeting you. If you're available, I can take you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Grey showered me with compliments, she also extended an invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top-tier socialite party must be the one with stringent entry requirements, where ordinary folks wouldn't stand a chance of attending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had heard my mom mention them before.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="569.html">« Prev</a><a href="571.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
