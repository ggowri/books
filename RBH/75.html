Over the years, whenever my dad had free time, he would go to the kitchen to help my mom. Even if he couldn't be of much assistance sometimes, he would still stand by my mom's side and chat with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to always think that love should be grand and magnificent. However, after experiencing life and death, I realized that it is actually the simple and ordinary companionship like my parents' that is truly rare. Being there for each other is the most sincere declaration of love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad, Happy Thanksgiving. I bought each of you a gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I entered the kitchen, hopping and skipping, carrying gifts. Afterward, I handed the gifts in my hands to each of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my, Madeline, what did you buy for us? Why did you buy us gifts today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother excitedly rubbed her hands on her apron. Afterward, she took the jewelry box that I handed to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't you like gemstone bracelets? Coincidentally, your favorite jewelry store just released a new collection of bracelets. I bought a set for you. My dad usually enjoys smoking cigars. I asked the shop assistant, and they said that the taste of this cigar is really good. Moreover, it's a newly imported product. Dad, why don't you give it a try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shared eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, I opened the jewelry box. I took out the string of emerald green gemstone bracelet from it and directly put it on my mother's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bracelet is really beautiful. Madeline has such good taste. Your mother looked even more elegant when she wore this bracelet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad, after seeing my mom put on the bracelet, couldn't stop praising her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, go sit on the sofa and try the cigar I bought. If you like it, I'll buy you more when I earn money in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed my dad into the living room. Then, I took out one from the cigar box and lit it specifically for my dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's rare for me to be so filial. My dad laughed until his eyes became slits. He took a puff of the cigar I bought for him, and then he said contentedly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, the taste is indeed good. Most importantly, it was my beloved daughter's intention!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you sit here and smoke slowly. I will go to the kitchen to help Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt as if I had become the obedient and well-behaved child from my childhood, who tried hard to please my parents. When I saw the genuine smiles on their faces, I couldn't express the comfort in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my help, my mom prepared a table full of delicious dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of us sat around the dining table. My dad opened a bottle of 1982 Lafite specially and said with a smile:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it has been five years since you last celebrated Thanksgiving with us. Today, the three of us had some drinks. It's rare for us to be this happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Have I not spent Thanksgiving with my parents for five years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard my parents say this, I inexplicably felt like crying. I couldn't help but reminisce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, indeed it was the five years my dad mentioned. In the first three years, I was still in college. During that time, I was like a bee buzzing around Elliott all day long, I didn't even want to go home. In the last two years, I hastily married Elliott. During the two Thanksgiving holidays after my marriage, I foolishly waited at home for Elliott to come back. But Elliott left me behind every Thanksgiving. He went back to spend time with his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It would be great if Elliott also came back with Madeline. Then our family's Thanksgiving would be complete."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mother took a small sip of red wine. Suddenly, she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When my mom mentioned Elliott, my dad's cheerful face instantly turned gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, let's not mention him. It seems like he has never acknowledged our existence. Madeline has been married to him for two years. He has only visited our house once. Ah, just thinking about it breaks my heart. Madeline is our only daughter. However, after she married Elliott, she was treated so coldly by the Bryant family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe because today is Thanksgiving, my dad had more to say than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard him say this, I felt even more bitter in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really don't know why I insisted on marrying Elliott back then. This also led to him looking down on even my parents. And the old me, however, never experienced my parents' feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, I didn't have a good life, and the most painful thing was my parents.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="74.html">« Prev</a><a href="76.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
