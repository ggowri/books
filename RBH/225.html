The emotions expressed in this song were very consistent with my mood in those years. It seemed to represent the deep love I once had for Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I just liked to listen to it in the past, but I had never sung it in front of anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, when I sang out loud with the microphone, I realized I had accumulated too much sadness and needed to vent it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting alone at the bar and looking at the screen, I sang loudly into the microphone. Quinn sat beside me at some point.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put his hand on my shoulder. When I finished singing, he patted me on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he leaned over and whispered in my ear, "Are you alright? Why were you singing so sadly?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head and looked at him. I wanted to smile, but for some reason, when I saw his face, my tears rolled down inexplicably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't say anything, but Quinn seemed to have understood. He leaned close to me again and said a word that almost made me collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you still unable to get over him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Quinn seemed to have read my mind and could always guess what I was thinking so easily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't answer, but he turned off the music.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Stop. Let's have more wine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and stood up. I wiped away my tears and quickly rejoined them, pretending nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn proposed, "Let's switch teams. Madeline and I will compete with the three of you. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige immediately looked at him with evil intentions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She joked, "What are you doing? You want to be Madeline's knight?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't I?" Quinn blinked and didn't deny it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, you can. But Madeline is unlucky tonight. Are you sure you want to be in a group with her?" Paige provoked with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure. If we lose and she can't drink, I will drink."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn patted his chest domineeringly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Let's get started!" Fiona said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's actions inexplicably made me feel warm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I knew many people in this world. But there were very few people who could understand you even if I didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I was stupidly infatuated with Elliott. I had never paid attention to other men, so I had never had male friends.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this life, Quinn's kindness indeed gave me some strength invisibly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly sorted out my feelings and had fun with them again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn whispered in my ear and occasionally taught me the tricks of playing dice. Under his guidance, I no longer lost all the time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I seemed to have regained my confidence in this game and suddenly became competitive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I worked together very well. Soon, the three of them couldn't drink anymore. In the end, they couldn't help but beg us for mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such pure venting was really delightful, and I became cheerful unconsciously. When I saw Paige couldn't drink anymore, I deliberately pinched her nose and poured the wine into her mouth, which made her chase me around in anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help laughing. Inadvertently, I saw Quinn staring at me. The relief and encouragement in his eyes touched me, and I smiled at him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="224.html">« Prev</a><a href="226.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
