As soon as he got in the car, he immediately took off his suit and threw it fiercely onto the seat next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a dark gray vertical collar shirt today. The shirt was slim-fitting, accentuating his head and body, making them even more perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was probably very angry, feeling hot all over. He decided to unbutton several buttons on his chest at once, revealing his charming and sexy chest muscles. He also rolled up the sleeves on both sides, exposing his strong and powerful arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was heavily thrown onto the back seat by him, even though it was a genuine leather seat. However, my wrist accidentally hit the glass, and it hurt so much that I couldn't get up for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head and watched as he gradually approached me, squatting directly in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to get up, but he pushed me again, forcing me to lie on the seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what did you want to do in the end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was also a little angry because of his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, we were not divorced yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me coldly, his tone icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what, what difference does it make!" I looked at him and said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't allow you to live at your parents' house permanently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me intently, his words filled with the authority of a superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had the freedom to choose where I lived, I was not your accessory, Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I became more and more annoyed, and the words I spoke became less and less polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is it that he could repeatedly appear in front of me with other women, doing whatever he wanted, while I couldn't even go home without his interference?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't forget, it was you who cried and shouted to marry me back then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was clearly angry too, as he grabbed my collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what? I said it, you want a divorce, you can do it anytime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was really tired...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than maintaining this superficial marriage, I actually wish we lived our own lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think that I don't dare to get a divorce!" Elliott's voice was extremely low, his gaze icy cold. "Do you really think that I didn't agree because I care so much about you? If it wasn't for..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was almost about to say the real reason why he didn't choose to get divorced, but he still held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he didn't say it, I understood it in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the upper class circle of Hoswich knew about the incident when Glory Group supported the Bryant Group with two billion dollars to help them through their difficulties. Now that the Bryant Group has improved, he wants to divorce me, and I'm afraid the reputation of their entire family will be damaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I certainly wouldn't be naive enough to think that Elliott cared so much about me that he wouldn't get divorced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just a business alliance...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="28.html">« Prev</a><a href="30.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
