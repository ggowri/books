Instantly, I felt nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that he would suddenly appear at the door of Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put her down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was cold, revealing a great deal of hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe being frightened by Elliott's powerful aura, Adam subconsciously let go of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I slid from Adam's back, which was out of my expectation, so I stumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Adam and Elliott grabbed my arm almost at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Release her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Elliott's expression became gloomier. He growled coldly and angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Adam could react, Elliott quickly led me towards his car by grabbing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what are you doing? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I attempted to get rid of his hand desperately. However, he was so strong that I failed to struggle to free myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, I was dragged to his car. He turned and pushed me against the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, looking sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you send me a divorce agreement? Are you angry with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one will choose divorce in a fit of anger. Elliott, I was serious. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he came here immediately after seeing the divorce agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said I won't divorce you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was as firm as ever, seeming that I was really his true love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help laughing sarcastically,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You and Giselle's child will be born in a few months. Don't you feel it is ridiculous that you say these words to me now? Let's get divorced. I was still young and not ready to be a stepmother. Elliott, please don't force me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished my words, Elliott's face became darker and darker, looking extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have explained the child to you. That was not my intention. Are you going to force me to take responsibility for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if that was not your intention, you are indeed the father of that child. Elliott, can you promise you will not care about the child at all after he is born? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked coldly. I felt heartache while mentioning these.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help thinking about the child in my belly. He was just signaling to the world that he was coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Giselle hadn't suddenly appeared, my child would have been the sweetest and happiest beginning between Elliott and me. At the same time, the Bryant family would have felt great joy after hearing the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Giselle was pregnant with his child. Everything had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, feeling the fickleness of the world, I only have hatred in my mind without feeling happiness at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I said I could?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was silent for a few seconds. His sight fixed on me, and he looked determined as the same as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I couldn't help sneering again after hearing his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you can't do it. I don't believe that you won't vacillate at all. If that child appears before you after he is born, are you sure that you will never care about him after looking at the face similar to yours? Moreover, I don't believe that when that child calls you "Dad", you can utterly ignore him. Elliott, I know you long to have a child, so I made you, letting you live a happy life with Giselle. If you have no objection to that divorce agreement, I can sign it at any time. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to be very calm as if I had no emotion left for Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But only I know how much heartache I feel at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the baby in my belly could be born healthy and safe, he would also need a father. Because he came to this world eager to enjoy the happiness of this world, but he had no chance anymore in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because I didn't want the happiness that came from my compromise.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="442.html">« Prev</a><a href="444.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
