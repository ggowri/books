We are still a bit far from Louis City, so I won't talk to you now. You can take a rest first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was indeed a careful boy. Although he was young, he considered things comprehensively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was indeed a little thirsty. When I picked up the water bottle and took a sip, I found that the temperature of the water was just right, and there was a faint sweetness to it. So I asked Adam, "What did you put in my water?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed and said, "People say that strawberries are rich in vitamin C, so I added some in. And also, you have been tired from long hours of staring at the computer lately, so I put in some blueberries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, you did a great job. Whoever becomes your girlfriend in the future, she will definitely be very happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing his heartwarming words, I couldn't help but smile with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, after I started working, I gradually realized that there are countless charming and handsome men in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Elliott was very popular, he was not as precious as I had thought in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's not that I can't find an alternative. In fact, time would gradually make people forget many things, even the deep feeling of love that I once forgot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, if you were single, I would definitely pursue you. I feel that women like you, who are more charming and attractive to men, are more appealing than girls like Giselle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam praised me at the right time, making me laugh heartily with his compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't talk nonsense. Giselle was younger than me, and besides, what do I have that's good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who told you that? I think you are more beautiful than her, more elegant than her, clearly from a noble background. And, most importantly, I think you are decisive in your actions, just like the female lead in a TV drama, incredibly captivating and admirable. I believe that the next drama you are going to be in will definitely be popular, because I trust that with your style of doing things, you cannot possibly fail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam praised me again, making me so happy that I couldn't see myself clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I started to doubt myself, thinking, "Was I really so excellent and capable in the eyes of others?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I was already so excellent, but Elliott still likes Giselle, is he blind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but silently criticize in my heart. However, in front of Adam, I couldn't appear too arrogant. I quickly smiled and said, "Stop. Don't flatter me anymore. I'm just like you, a newcomer in the workplace. If I really were as good as you say, everything would be perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, you are excellent!" I didn't expect Adam to become so anxious. "Madeline, you must have confidence in yourself. I think you have the potential to be a powerful woman, and you will definitely succeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam's words instantly made me happy, and all the gloom in my heart was washed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Paige used to say that the reason I was so crazy about Elliott was because I had little experience with men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems to be true, I have encountered too few men. If there were more young men like Adam surrounding me, praising me every day, would I still worry about Elliott and his first love?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, will the male lead of our play also be present at the scene?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="139.html">« Prev</a><a href="141.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
