Is your face badly hurt? Do you need to see a doctor?" Elliott asked with genuine concern in front of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My face still stings, but it's okay. I'll just use a hot towel on it later," Giselle replied, covering her face with a hint of coyness, making me feel even more disgusted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you doing here? Elliott, you're here too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily's voice was heard from the hallway. Probably because she hadn't seen me for a while, Lily came out to find me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I almost simultaneously called out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, what happened to your face? What's going on, who hit you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole, who was with Lily, noticed Giselle's face immediately and rushed over, pulling Giselle's hand away from her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five finger marks were still visible, and as soon as Nicole saw them, her voice immediately sharpened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who hit you so hard? Giselle, who slapped you? Tell me, I'll help you get justice!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admitted it directly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole turned her head to look at me in disbelief. Probably because mothers couldn't stand to see their children wronged, Nicole, who had always been polite to me, pushed me hard after hearing me say that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to have gone mad, questioning me repeatedly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you hit Giselle? What did she do to deserve such a heavy blow? Even if our family is inferior, you... you can't bully people like this, can you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was already thin, and with no defense, Nicole's push made me stagger backwards and hit the railing in the corridor, causing me to groan in pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Lily immediately rushed forward and shielded me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nicole, let's talk things out. There must be a misunderstanding. You can't push Madeline without finding out the truth first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing my groan of pain, Lily felt sorry for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to ask me, "Are you okay? Did you hit anywhere?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'm fine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, but in reality, my waist was still hurting. I just didn't want Lily to worry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, tell me what happened, why did she hit you?" Nicole began questioning Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, don't ask, it's nothing. I don't want to make a scene and embarrass Elliott. Let's go, back home."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Elliott, Giselle put on a forgiving look and didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I couldn't help but let out a cold laugh and expose her deeds.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nicole, you should ask your daughter where she slept last night and who she was with."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole sensed the hidden meaning in my words, and her voice sharpened again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, where did you sleep last night? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was about to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's voice suddenly came over, interrupting Giselle's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you all standing here? What's going on, is something wrong?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="237.html">« Prev</a><a href="239.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
