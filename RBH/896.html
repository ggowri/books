How could she possibly have no connection to Giselle?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were miles apart, and I had someone dig into Giselle's past. There was no trace of any connection between her and Onastin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, all of this just became even more bizarre.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fox, are you going to keep playing dumb?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, I'm sorry, but I really don't know what you're talking about. I'm a good person. If you think I'm out to get you, then by all means, investigate!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa said, her voice icy. She was hinting that she wasn't scared in the slightest of my investigation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? If I were to dig deeper, I'm afraid your dirty tricks would be exposed. The situation with Elliott in the hospital last time, and now with Lucy, you're the one who knows best who's pulling the strings behind the scenes!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she's not scared, then I'm certainly not. I said it straight out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa pressed her lips together, a soft chuckle escaping her. She didn't seem scared at all. She continued to speak:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, I honestly have no clue what you're on about. I thought, given our resemblance, we could be good pals. But with all this hostility you're showing, it seems like we can't be friends after all. Take care of yourself, Ms. Mayers. I'm off to practice some ball."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned on her heel and walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared intently at her bewitching silhouette, growing increasingly fearful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Lisa stepped out, Grey sauntered in. The moment she entered, she immediately took my hand into hers, examining it. Then she said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling you, Elliott's charm is just too irresistible. It's that very allure that got you hurt. We were all having a good time today, who could've predicted this? Madeline, you better keep your distance from Elliott, or you might just lose your life!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie Grey, no one could have predicted Lucy's actions. It was an unexpected incident, don't let it weigh on your heart."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She beckoned me over, but then things went south. She was beating herself up about it, so I quickly stepped in to comfort her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my opinion, what happened today doesn't seem like an accident, but more like someone's out to get you. That woman named Lisa, she's cunning and I don't like her one bit. You need to be wary of her. When she left just now, I saw her smirking. She seemed so smug, it was unsettling."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling triumphant?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that her aim today wasn't to have Lucy kill me, but to infuriate me, to warn me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh-huh, I know. I just tried to test her, but she's been playing dumb with me. Auntie Grey, could you please keep an eye on her for me? Thanks a lot!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't just sit here and do nothing anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she continues to target me behind my back, and I remain defenseless, I fear that one day she might take my life using some inexplicable methods, all under the radar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not just living for myself now, I'm living for Noah, for my parents. I can't let anyone scheme against me like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heart of the night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I made up an excuse to return home. After tucking Noah into bed, I knocked on Marcus's door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medicinal herb base over in Norch City is pretty much set up. He's recently returned to Hoswich City. However, aside from necessary work-related communication, we haven't had a chance to meet up privately yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knocking on his door so late at night, I startled him. He quickly ushered me in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as I stepped through the door, I found a woman simmering soup in his kitchen.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="895.html">« Prev</a><a href="897.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
