He walked away in a hurry and took two steps back. We both looked back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did I realize that Elliott had come behind us at some point.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wearing a black sweater and trousers, he seemed to blend into the night. His face looked even more mysterious in the hazy night, especially his eyes seemed to contain infinite information, making people dare not look at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put one hand in his pocket, and there was no one behind him. It didn't look like he had driven here, but he seemed to be following us all the way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when did he come behind us?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, did he hear the conversation between Quinn and me just now?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While thinking, I suddenly felt a little scared, but I stood there and didn't speak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you behind us? This is not like you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being stunned for a few seconds, Quinn pretended to be relaxed and joked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's expression remained serious, and he sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe you were so engrossed that you didn't notice me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was clearly suggesting something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he had misunderstood Quinn and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? Madeline and I just took a walk and chatted after drinking. She lives nearby, so I sent her back. Don't overthink it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn naturally understood what Elliott meant. He stepped forward, still pretending to be relaxed. He patted Elliott on the shoulder, trying to ease the embarrassment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Elliott didn't appreciate it. Instead, he grabbed Quinn's arm and twisted it hard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he said coldly, "Do you still consider me a friend?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was rude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I were just friends. Even when we walked together, all we discussed was about Elliott, but he thought we had an affair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stepped forward quickly and said, "Elliott, what are you doing? Quinn just wanted to send me home. Why do you do this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glanced at me, and his cold look made me shiver.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you feel sorry for him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went too far.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt sorry for Quinn? Did Elliott know what he was talking about?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speechless. At this moment, Quinn's expression also became serious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, let go of your hand. We have known each other for so many years, and you have no trust in me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had before, but now, I doubt you very much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had no intention of letting go of Quinn. His face was clouded with anger, and even his words were full of hostility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're overthinking it. I just see Madeline as a friend."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? If you have no feelings for her, why are you always alone with her? Do you know that she is my woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott felt angrier. He twisted Quinn's arm, seeming to be displaying his ownership over me without the slightest tolerance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was calm at first, but hearing Elliott's, he suddenly lost his temper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up and broke his arm free from Elliott's hand. Then, he grabbed Elliott's collar, his eyes full of hostility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said she is your woman. Let me ask you, can you love her wholeheartedly and take care of her as your woman from now on?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea why Quinn was so angry. It wasn't like he pitied me, but more like he felt sorry for me as a family and wanted to teach Elliott a lesson on my behalf.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="227.html">« Prev</a><a href="229.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
