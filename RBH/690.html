Don't you think that behaving like this is completely inconsistent with your identity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rolled my eyes and wished I could just jump out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words were so impolite, but unexpectedly, Elliott not only didn't get angry, but also showed a hint of smile in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't think so. I would do anything to get my wife back. What's so strange about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Elliott finished speaking, he wanted to pull me into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a shameless man! He even started to play such a trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened my eyes wide and looked at him, feeling that his deep eyes were full of </span><span>affection, as if he was tempting me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tensed my body, and my heart raced because of his seductive eyes. In the past, he didn't need to pester me, he just needed to look at me with such eyes, and I would immediately uncontrollably throw myself into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I just wanted to escape, so I desperately pushed his hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I really didn't like the way you are now. Could you please let go of my hand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott did not. "My biggest regret is letting go of your hand. But, it is because of this that I realized how important you are to me during this time apart. Madeline, don't deny it. Your eyes tell me that you still love me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said I still love you?" I became agitated all of a sudden. "I admit that I did love you before, but that love has long vanished. The more you act like this now, the more repulsed I become!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's find that love together!" Elliott frowned, his possessiveness still evident in his words, as he tightened his arm around my waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's impossible. I will never get back together with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my chin, looked into his eyes, and said earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline..." he stared at me, as if declaring sovereignty, "it's fine that you don't want to get back together with me now. With me here, I won't let you fall in love with someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were simply unreasonable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a little dizzy. Elliott's shameless behavior made me angry, but I was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Elliott continued to have that cold and aloof demeanor as before, I actually felt more relaxed, and it didn't seem so difficult to escape from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he bec</span><span>a</span><span>me a scoundrel. He act</span><span>ed</span><span> as if he cl</span><span>ung</span><span> to me, but I h</span><span>ad</span><span> no way to deal with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that women like this kind of thing. I admit, in the past, I was too indifferent. Now, I want to warm your heart again. You probably didn't eat enough for lunch, right? Is there anything you want to eat? I can take you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott showed no intention of letting me go. On the contrary, he released his grip and even tidied up my disheveled clothes for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My belly looked particularly prominent between him and me. Just at the moment when he was tidying up my clothes, the baby seemed to sense its dad and suddenly moved vigorously in my belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott keenly captured the joy in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, did the baby move? Was it the baby moving just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively reached out to touch my stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was supposed to be such a sweet scene between the couple...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when I saw the joy in his eyes, I couldn't help but think of him and Giselle... When Giselle was pregnant, he must have felt this joy more than once. He would definitely have the urge to touch her belly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made me feel really disgusted.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="689.html">« Prev</a><a href="691.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
