It's normal that you don't think about it now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned on the head of the bed and answered faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have to talk to me like this?" Elliott frowned again in dissatisfaction. "I was wrong last night, and in the future, I will consider your feelings more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time I heard such understanding words from Elliott, to be honest, I was quite surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head and looked at him, raised my eyebrows</span><span>,</span><span> and sarcastically said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying that you want to consider my feelings? Well, either you call Sylvia right now in front of me and tell her not to appear in front of you anymore, or what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, as soon as Elliott heard my words, his previously calm face instantly darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you should not take advantage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said he considered my feelings, but he was not willing to give up even a mere Sylvia. Moreover, in the near future, he was going to meet his true love!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his reaction, I felt even more suffocated inside. I decided to bury my head in the blanket and never wanted to say another word to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bryant Group is soon going to hold its mid-year banquet. This banquet is important for the Bryant Group. Get yourself prepared these days. You will attend it with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott remained silent for a moment by himself, probably realizing that I didn't seem interested in paying attention to him. So, he spoke again and informed me about the news of the mid-year banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he had never thought about having me accompany him to any important occasions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We have been married for two years, but I was like a non-existent entity to him. Even though his parents reminded him several times to bring me along, he remained indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he suddenly expressed his desire to involve me together, which really "surprised me and made me feel honored".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mid-year banquet... Wasn't that the time I met Giselle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had been secretly preparing for this dinner for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I will prepare well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not defy him again, but instead</span><span>,</span><span> I uncovered the blanket and calmly responded to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Elliott wanted me to attend, I certainly had to exercise my right as Mrs. Bryant and dress up in my finest attire to attend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't wait to see it. By then, I had already seized the opportunity for Giselle to shine. How would she meet Elliott in what way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, there was a faint excitement in my heart, and a hint of smile involuntarily appeared on my face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, unaware of why I was laughing, and thought it was because he had invited me to the party and made me happy. So, he suddenly reached out and gently patted my head, like doting on a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you just behaved well, I would consider taking you to more public events in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ha, he was such an infatuated guy! I really appreciate it, you know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, now we are like a couple. It would be even better if those scandalous individuals didn't bother me from time to time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately went along with him, but there were still hidden words in my words, deliberately making him feel frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That depends on whether you have the ability to capture my heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who knew, Elliott, for the first time ever, wasn't angry. Instead, he suddenly bent down and tucked the edges of the blanket I had opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His actions seemed as if he was afraid that I would feel cold.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="35.html">« Prev</a><a href="37.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
