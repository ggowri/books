Why don't you both sit down? I just washed some fruit, let me peel a pear for you." Lily didn't notice any oddity between Elliott and me. Seeing Elliott in the hospital room, she was overjoyed. Her demeanor was as if her son had come.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, I've been a bit busy these days. Sorry, I haven't found the time to come to the hospital to see Austin," Elliott quickly detached himself from the earlier emotions. He hastened to approach and said to my mom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, I know you've been busy. I'm just glad you came to visit him. I'm sure he would be happy to hear your voice," My mom hurriedly said. Then, she subconsciously glanced at Austin, her eyes hiding a restrained sadness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Austin now? What did the doctor say about his condition?" Elliott asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The blood clot in his head has been dealt with. But I don't know why, he's still not waking up. He should have regained consciousness by now." My mom shook her head in distress. When it came to my dad's condition, she almost couldn't help but cry out loud again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my mom upset, Elliott quickly reached out to support her shoulder. "Lily, don't be sad. How about I arrange to transfer him to another hospital? My family's hospital has brain specialists, and the equipment is more advanced than here. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott once again suggested transferring my dad to another hospital. But as soon as I heard it, I decisively rejected it. "No need. The doctor said that my dad's brain injury is basically healed now. The reason he hasn't woken up yet is because there hasn't been enough external stimulation. Maybe in a little while, my dad will wake up. There's no need to go to all that trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's grandfather and parents had already decided to kick me out of the house. My dignity didn't allow me to take my dad over there and beg for help.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, once my dad was transferred there, it meant I would have to see Giselle frequently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was already feeling annoyed and didn't want to see her face for the time being.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott obviously didn't understand what I truly mean. He thought I was simply refusing his kindness. His expression stiffened a bit. "I don't see any problem, Madeline. You don't want me to help you, do you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his icy tone, I could tell he was clearly angry. After all, this was not the first time I had turned him down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how to explain, so I just said lightly, "That's not what I meant, but I don't want my dad to be transferred right now. If he needs it later, I'll reach out to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So in your eyes, no matter what I do, I'm still a stranger to you!" Elliott clearly misunderstood me. His voice became colder after saying this, and he immediately turned away, as if he didn't want to stay in the hospital room any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, Madeline didn't mean it like that. What's going on between you two? As a couple, you should talk things out calmly," My mom, seeing Elliott upset, got worried and quickly grabbed his hand and said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lily, in Madeline's eyes, she probably never saw me as her husband." Elliott turned his back to me. When he said this, I could feel that his tone was very low, as if he was deeply hurt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew maybe if I rushed over, grabbed and explained to him, or acted coquettishly with him, everything might change.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was as if I had been petrified, standing still in place. I could not move at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, there's new information about the investigation you asked me to look into!" Right at that moment, Quinn coincidentally rushed into the hospital room.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="311.html">« Prev</a><a href="313.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
