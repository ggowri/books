The strong odor of alcohol mingled between our breaths. We were closer than we had ever been before.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the love that had been sealed in my heart came out, as if the seal had been lifted at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the fantasies I had been looking forward to in those years were more mellow than wine, like poison, invading my brain and making me crazier than ever before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had ignored entirely everything around us and had not cared whether Quinn was still there or not.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his embrace, I kissed Elliott eagerly and recklessly. I sensed him lifting me, carrying me from the room to the car. Our intimacy continued unabated from the car all the way to Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, when I was thrown onto the big bed at Serenity Villa, which I was very familiar with, my whole body felt like a puddle of melted ice cream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if confirmed, Elliott leaned forward and suddenly in my ear, "It turns out that you still love me deeply."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears burst out of my eyes... I couldn't tell whether it was joy or something else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott began to take the lead, suppressing my hands and kissing me with unrestrained passion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I closed my eyes. The alcohol still made me dizzy, but I was extremely aware of what I was doing at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All my clothes were quickly taken off by him...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, all the clothes on his body were gone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He switched off the light, enveloping us in darkness that obscured his expression. I could discern his faint outline and feel the warmth of his lips, his body, and his touch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, we..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shh, don't speak and just enjoy it quietly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott kissed me on the lips again, preventing me from saying any words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed we had been expecting and waiting for too long. In extreme pain, after so many years, our connection blossomed into sexual delights.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a romantic night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, I sat up from the bed with my exhausted body. The sight of the messy clothes on the floor suddenly reminded me of what had happened between Elliott and me last night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt dizzy from a hangover. With the realization, I subconsciously got up from the bed, but there was a sharp pain in my body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared blankly at Elliott, who was still asleep on the bed. The slightly disheveled hair did not detract from his handsome face but instead added some unique charm to him. He was lying on his side with one hand on my pillow. He had imprints on his arm, the result of me lying on his arm. Half of his body was exposed outside the smoky gray silk satin quilt, and his slightly bronzed skin looked particularly sexy against the soft bedding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was visibly tired. Being always a light sleeper, he was not woken up by me this time. He still slept soundly. The outline of his profile looked so attractive that it was hard to take my eyes away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene should have happened every morning after we got married.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even though we had been married for several years, and I had loved him for so long, it seemed that only at this moment, in this early morning, could I truly feel his presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, did we really have sex?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I patted my face, almost thinking I was dreaming, but the soreness in my body made me believe that it was all real.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but recall last night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We'd never been so crazy.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="262.html">« Prev</a><a href="264.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
