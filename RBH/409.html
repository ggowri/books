He pulled me into his embrace and spoke in a soft voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your parents' villa has been standing for ages, but the security measures are lacking. With these recent incidents one after another, I think it's best for you to find another place to stay. You have the surveillance footage, so let's call the police and have them investigate what's going on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott dialed the police, and soon enough, a patrol car arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I handed over the surveillance footage and recounted the events to the officers, while they swiftly gathered evidence around the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after their investigation, the police informed me that the intruder was cunning. He wore gloves, leaving no fingerprints behind. Despite meticulous efforts, they couldn't extract any identifiable features from the blurry figure in the footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking the necessary statements, the police departed, promising to keep me informed of any developments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stayed by my side throughout. By the time the police left, the sky was beginning to lighten, as it was already around four or five in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted and shaken from the night's events, I couldn't bear to stay in the house I'd lived in for so many years anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott helped me into his car and said in a low voice, "Let's head back to Serenity Villa. You can take a shower and get some rest there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slumping in the seat and drained from the ordeal, I had forgotten about the earlier tension between us. All I felt was an unknown fear, making me reluctant to be alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded weakly, closing my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott drove swiftly, bringing me back to Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so exhausted that I could barely move when we arrived. Without waiting for me to get out of the car, Elliott swiftly opened the door and carried me into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nestled against him, I let him carry me into the familiar yet foreign surroundings of Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean, alerted by the commotion, hurried out of his room. Seeing Elliott holding me, he paused, then quickly approached us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. and Mrs. Bryant, why did you return so late? Are you hungry? Do you need anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's alright, you can go to bed," Elliott instructed calmly before carrying me upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gently, he placed me on our bed, then leaned down to press a soft kiss to my forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me find your pajamas," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott disappeared into the closet, returning shortly with the set of pajamas I had worn before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took the pajamas and hurried to the bathroom for a shower, then slipped into bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I burrowed under the covers, the familiar scent enveloped me, and I, exhausted beyond measure, drifted off to sleep in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometime later, I vaguely felt another presence beside me. A large hand gently pulled me closer, the firm embrace offering a sense of profound security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so exhausted I could barely keep my eyes open, and I instinctively sought comfort in his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a daze, I heard him say softly, "Sleep tight, darling. I love you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="408.html">« Prev</a><a href="410.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
