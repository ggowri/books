Madeline, were you guys joking with me? It must be the case!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes were filled with intense skepticism. The way he appeared so confident that his ideas were absolutely correct seemed ridiculous and ironic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, a man who was about to get engaged to someone else, was still pondering over this question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't he realize that his ideas were too contradictory?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed Elliott's hand away and said, "Mr. Bryant, can you stop avoiding reality?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at his still handsome face, but there was no longer any ripple in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was strange. In the past, when Elliott stood in front of me, even if he didn't say a word, my heart would race when I saw his handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was so close to me, yet I found no charm in him. My heart no longer raced for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, that was the difference between love and not loving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The present Elliott resembled me who desperately tried to win him back in the past. His constant inner turmoil and questioning if he still held a place in my heart, truly resembled the me from that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were wrong, Madeline, would you dare to let the child have a paternity test with me after it is born?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott reluctantly reached out and hooked his hand under my chin once again. He forced me to meet his gaze, probably trying to discern something through my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I remained incredibly calm and my gaze was particularly firm. I calmly retorted, "Didn't you just see Quinn kiss me? We have both met each other's parents, and yet you make this demand. Don't you think you're bringing shame upon yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The confidence on Elliott's face vanished instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him with a knowing expression, gently removing his hand and saying calmly, "Quinn and the Woods family are not fools, they won't accept someone else's child. So, Elliott, please accept the reality that for now, we are strangers. I heard you are getting engaged at the end of the month, congratulations in advance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I appeared very calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, I was thinking, "Just wait, Elliott. I will give you a big gift on the day of your engagement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott became serious and seemed to still not be able to accept this fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I insisted on the paternity test? You don't have to worry, if the test results prove that the child is not mine, I will never appear in front of you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so persistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speechless and helpless immediately. I thought that with my firm words, Elliott would give up, but unexpectedly, he didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Elliott had this idea, he would definitely not give up until he achieved his goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And how could I possibly let him know the truth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Elliott knew the truth, I was afraid that he, the Bryant family, and I would be plunged back into an endless battle for the child. And this is not what I wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see no point in doing this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I firmly refused again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me. His eyes rapidly changed, and I didn't know what he had been thinking in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say anything more, but just started the car again and drove off with me towards the front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Elliott would really take me to the hospital to apologize to Laura. But to my surprise, he dropped me off downstairs at Glory Group and then said to me, "You may get off now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a bit surprised, so I asked, "Didn't you want me to apologize to your mom or pay the medical bills?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="633.html">« Prev</a><a href="635.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
