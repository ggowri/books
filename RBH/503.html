I felt even more sarcastic and said coldly, "Elliott, I can see it, and I can judge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's all my fault. I asked you to accompany me to the maternity and baby store to help my sister choose clothes. Otherwise, you wouldn't have met these bad people and be angered by them. They messed this place up. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam sensed my anger. So, he helped me out and also laughed at Giselle and Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that people always met those they hated. I really didn't want to stay here any longer, so I nodded, turned around, and prepared to leave with Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, hold on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stopped me and subconsciously wanted to step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Giselle said, "Elliott, I suddenly feel that my waist is painful, and I can't stand any longer. My waist hurts so much, and so does my stomach."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands were on her waist. She shouted while leaning her body against Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held Elliott's arm tightly. Their closeness annoyed me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at Elliott, the man I had loved for so long. I suddenly felt he was very strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never wanted to see this disgusting scene again, so I turned around and left the store without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked very fast. Adam quickly caught up and seemed to want to express his support for me. Knowing that Elliott was looking at us, Adam deliberately came forward, put his arm around my shoulders, and whispered, "Madeline, I'm sorry. I'm doing this to help you anger them! Does Mr. Bryant really think you can't live without him? I want him to know that you are very popular!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Adam's behavior was childish, it made me feel better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one couldn't survive without someone. Elliott was nothing special!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I got back in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam drove me away quickly and sent me home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I walked in the door, I saw Austin lying on the couch, Marcus concentrating on taking special treatment for him, and Lily preparing dinner in the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stepped forward. At this moment, Marcus finished the treatment. He gave me a look and motioned for me to step aside. He seemed to have something to say to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I followed him to the side in confusion. He pushed his glasses into place and said seriously, "Madeline, have you watched the news? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What news?" I asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryant Group just announced today that they have cooperated with Ocean Pharmaceutical, a leading domestic pharmaceutical company, to launch an antiviral oral solution. I checked the formula of their solution and found it is very similar to the formula of the anti-flu capsule."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words shocked me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="502.html">« Prev</a><a href="504.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
