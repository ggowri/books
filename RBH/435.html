However, he was a step too late. I had already opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man who had just come to use the restroom stood at the doorway, staring at us in shock, and exclaimed loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pulled my hair back from my forehead and walked out with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain in my chest still prickled at me. I leaned against the wall subconsciously as I was unsteady on my feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline... Madeline Bryant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott followed me out and called out my name, trying to make me stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't want to turn back. Pretending to be strong, I left quickly without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the restaurant, the night was profoundly deep. The entire sky was covered with clouds, making it hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked briskly to my car, got in, and slammed the door shut. That was when I couldn't hold back any longer and burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that even if I could foresee and arrange many things in this life, I couldn't change fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle still won, and I was forced to face the end of being cast out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clutching my chest, I gazed out the window at the raging wind. I was not ready to give up. I refused to let it end here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silently, I swore to myself that I would not let Giselle succeed and take everything away again. Not this time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned back in my seat, struggling to catch my breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, my stomach churned uncomfortably again, even though I had nothing left to throw up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long about of retched, I finally felt a bit better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the storm broke. It was late, and while the hotel entrance had been bustling with rideshare drivers earlier, it was now deserted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trapped in my car, I reluctantly dialed Quinn's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was a night owl, so obviously, he wasn't asleep. He answered quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up? Calling me this late?" Quinn asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was as casual as ever as if he was never troubled by anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been drinking and can't drive back. There's no ride around. Can you come pick me up? I'm at Jade Restaurant," I said straightforwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"OK, wait for me. I'll be there in ten minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn seemed always ready to help without a fuss. He didn't ask any further and agreed readily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hung up and sat waiting in the seat. Soon, I saw his large SUV charge through the rain, headlights blazing as he pulled up fiercely beside my car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rain continued to pour heavily. He quickly jumped out, umbrella in hand, and came over to get me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened the door, and he immediately wrapped an arm around my shoulders, swiftly helping me into the passenger seat before hopping in and shutting the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? You look so pale, and your eyes are red. Have you been crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn immediately noticed something was off as soon as he got into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brows and asked with concern, remarkably perceptive despite the dim lighting.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="434.html">« Prev</a><a href="436.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
