Wherever he went, he was always the star of the group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he hadn't contacted me in the past two weeks. Surely, his parents or grandparents must be giving him a lot of pressure. How could he possibly have the time to attend such a costume party?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts, I instinctively felt that he couldn't be Elliott. Based on what I know about Elliott, he would never initiate conversations with women, so how could the man who asked me to have a drink with him be Elliott?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, but you'll have to give me a reason to join you for a drink."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The justification I came up with allowed me to relax and I asked tentatively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the mask, I couldn't see his expression at all. He simply picked up the two glasses of wine in front of him and handed one to me without hesitation, his voice calm yet seductive,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think you're the most special among all the girls. How about that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was exactly like Elliott's, causing my heart to race uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the damned black robe was too loose, obscuring his figure completely. Therefore, I couldn't determine if he was Elliott or just a random stranger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This party was organized by Quinn. Logically, if Elliott was here, Quinn would definitely know, and he would surely tell me about it. Thinking about it this way, I became more convinced that the man in front of me couldn't be Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reason accepted, and I'll drink this glass with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but feel a strong curiosity about this man, whose voice resembled Elliott's. So, I raised the glass and clinked it with his, then immediately downed it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me finish the drink, he didn't hesitate either, lifting his glass and finishing his own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You sound a lot like someone I know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the drink, I looked at him and said tentatively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the eerie and dim lighting at the party, I couldn't see his eyes clearly for a moment. But upon hearing my words, he suddenly leaned closer, whispering lowly in my ear, "Is that so? Then who do you think I am?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone and demeanor were exactly like Elliott's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that the man sitting next to me was really him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down my spine, and at that moment, I had a strong urge to remove the mask from his face.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="273.html">« Prev</a><a href="275.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
