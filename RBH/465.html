He thought that Quinn and I were returning home late because of our romantic relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a mix of amusement and disbelief, I replied, "Dad, don't worry. Quinn and I are very close friends. I understand your concerns. I won't rush into another relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Austin finally eased his worries and slowly said, "That's good to hear. I was afraid you weren't thinking things through. When others show you more attention, you tend to lose your sense of boundaries. You've made a mistake once. From now on, tread carefully. It's better to miss out than to make another mistake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my head and nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand, Dad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We exchanged a glance, and then both involuntarily smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Austin's improved spirits each day lifted my own mood unintentionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I helped Austin to his bedroom, then returned to mine. After a quick shower, I lay down on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was incredibly tired. The moment I lay down, I felt overwhelmingly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to the early stages of pregnancy, I soon drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christmas arrived quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the staff from the Glory Group went on collective leave. The next day, I held a meeting to discuss arrangements for the holiday period. Now, I could relax for a few days and prepare for work after the holidays.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona and Paige were also on vacation. Since we hadn't seen each other in a long time, we arranged to meet at our usual spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Paige, I noticed her belly had blossomed into a round mound, and she seemed to have put on some weight herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing me, she immediately opened her arms and gave me a big hug, then jokingly scolded me, "Madeline, you're so heartless. It's been so long since we've met!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To make it up to you, it's my treat today. You can order whatever you want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Then I won't hold back. I've been through the early stages of pregnancy, and now I have a huge appetite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige didn't hesitate to grab the menu and start ordering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Consider reducing your consumption of sweets. Failing to regulate your sugar intake could potentially lead to gestational diabetes,"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona advised Paige out of professional concern upon seeing her order so much food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. I've been craving a lot. When I'm at home, Philip doesn't let me eat anything. I didn't expect when I'm with you guys, you won't let me relax. Being pregnant is no fun if I can't enjoy myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From her words, I could sense that her relationship with Philip seemed to be going well recently. So, I tentatively asked her, "How far have you and Philip progressed now? Have you met each other's parents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige flopped onto the sofa. Her rounded belly, combined with the hoodie she was wearing, made her look especially cute. She grumbled, "Yes. Our parents have also met. His parents said that, considering I'm already in my second trimester, if we were to have a wedding ceremony, I'd be too tired. So they plan to hold the wedding after the baby is born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? It seems like your parents have accepted each other. That's a good thing, Paige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I cheered upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paige didn't seem too happy. She pursed her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But my dad thinks getting pregnant before getting married is shameful, so he's still mad at me. If it wasn't for my brother persuading him, he would've disowned me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my memory, Paige's dad was very strict. Since she was suppressed so much since she was young, Paige became rebellious when she grew up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her sudden pregnancy, with her dad's temperament, it was normal for him to be angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't your dad always like this? But he definitely still loves you; otherwise, he wouldn't have let you act up all these years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, enough about me. How are you doing now? Madeline, I heard you're getting a divorce from Elliott?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="464.html">« Prev</a><a href="466.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
