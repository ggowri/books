But by then, he too was completely out of control.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay in that room. I... I'll get us to the hospital right away. Listen, keep your distance from me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, his usual composure came into play at this moment. Despite the struggle of restraint, he still tried his best to control himself. He pointed to an empty room not far away and said to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, stumbling my way towards the direction of that room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing open the door to the room, I immediately collapsed onto the couch. My body writhed uncontrollably on the soft cushions. I felt an unbearable heat coursing through me. My sanity was completely gone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, the door to the room was finally nudged open.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this very moment, I was completely out of control, not caring who was around. I felt like a woman who hadn't seen a man in a decade. Any man I laid my eyes on, I would uncontrollably throw myself at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I crashed directly into their embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hand was uncontrollably wandering over the other person's body. The room was dimly lit, making it impossible for me to discern who it was. All I could perceive was a blur before my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I traced my fingers along his face, instinctively seeking his lips, yearning to lean in for a kiss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you end up drinking like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dimness, I heard a slightly magnetic male voice echoing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand found its way to my waist, pulling me close. My hands continued to roam his body. I could feel his desire awakening. He was breathing slightly heavier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This voice, it seems to be Elliott's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is he here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was vaguely familiar to me. However, my discomfort was too overwhelming to allow any further thought. I buried my face in his chest, my arms wrapping around his neck. I couldn't resist, and my lips found their way to his.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't even know what I'm babbling about," I muttered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kiss... me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Quinn do this to you? What on earth is he up to?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone was decidedly sour. However, he didn't actually do anything to me. He simply hoisted me up by the waist and carried me out of the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blinding brightness in the hallway momentarily stunned me. I could hear a cacophony of voices around me, filled with arguments and the sound of tussling. Amidst the chaos, I could discern the low growls of men.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I yearned to pry my eyes open, to witness what was unfolding. But at that moment, my body had completely slipped from my control.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I writhed like a snake, fighting for my life. I felt as if I was dropped halfway, torn apart, and then hoisted up again by the waist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, I was hoisted into a car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rumble of the car engine reached my ears. The sway of the vehicle only added to my discomfort. The sense of unease within me grew more pronounced.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fumbled around uncontrollably, and finally, I grasped a warm hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, I was like a cheetah catching the scent of its prey, uncontrollably drawn forward, plunging myself into their embrace...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="790.html">« Prev</a><a href="792.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
