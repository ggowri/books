I am very worried about Paige."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona shook her head and held my hand, saying, "You were pregnant. Don't go in. If anything happens, I will inform you promptly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she glanced at Philip again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip dared not speak and changed into sterile clothing. He immediately followed Fiona into the emergency room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door of the emergency room closed once again. Not knowing what was happening inside, I could only sit on the bench outside, silently praying for Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For me, those few minutes of waiting lasted for a century.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About ten minutes later, the door of the emergency room opened again, and Fiona and Philip walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what had happened. Philip looked pale, his hands hanging limply at his sides, looking like a zombie. Fiona looked serious, her always wise eyes filled with an unprecedented gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, how was Paige doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona took off her mask and shook her head helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She lost too much blood and refused to cooperate with the doctors. Her baby no longer had a fetal heart. She made up her mind to break up with Philip and have an abortion. Madeline, what happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Is she so heartless? The child is about to be born soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her words, I was so shocked I almost couldn't stand. I placed my hand over my chest as a sudden sharp pain hit my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona and I knew better than anyone how much Paige cared about this child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her child, she endured the hardships of morning sickness, resisted the pressure from her parents, and accepted the apathetic attitude of Philip's family. She tried her best to provide a good future for her child. Moreover, she had already prepared a room as well as various items of clothing and supplies for the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Paige's first child. It was impossible that she didn't love him. But now, she would rather give him up. It seemed she was heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have tried my best to persuade her. The attending doctor and nurses were very worried as the fetal heart was getting weaker, but Paige did not cooperate with the rescue. This time, she is truly disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was angry and upset. She couldn't help but grab Philip by the collar and loudly query, "Philip, what did you do to make her so angry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip looked like he had been pulled out of water. His shirt was soaked with sweat, </span><span>looking sticky and wet. He stared at Fiona hollowly, on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know I was wrong. It was me who broke Paige's heart. Fiona, please go and persuade her. The child is about to be born. How can she give up at this time? How am I going to explain to her parents and my parents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What good does it do to know you're wrong now? The child no longer has a fetal heart. We've missed the critical time to save it. Philip, Paige is very proud, but she is willing to suffer for you. And you betrayed her. You are scum!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="605.html">« Prev</a><a href="607.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
