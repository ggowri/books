And I remembered that in my previous life, Patrick was taken abroad by his children. Was it such a coincidence?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandfather is a doctor. Well, I know. Come on. I'll take you home!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I decided to give it a try and promptly walked back with Byron in my arms. Before long, we arrived at Patrick's doorstep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, there had been a lock on Patrick's door just moments ago, but now it was gone, indicating Patrick's return.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Byron recognized his home at once. He instantly struggled off me, excitedly slapping the door and shouting, "This is my home! Grandpa! Grandpa!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Byron, my baby, where have you been? I was so close to calling the police!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A call came from inside. Immediately afterward, an elegant elderly man with short hair hurriedly ran out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Byron, he quickly hugged him and kept muttering, "Thank God!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I had never seen Patrick before, the distinguished older man standing was indeed Patrick.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, she sent me home!" Byron said gleefully to Patrick, pointing at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up at me gratefully and stood up with Byron in his arms. He said in a rush, "I really appreciate it. I just took him out to buy something, but I didn't realize that when I was paying for it, he ran far away on his own. It was raining heavily. I searched around twice but couldn't find her. It was driving me crazy!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're welcome. You should be Doctor Cullen. Hoswich Medical University recommends that I come here to visit you. It's quite a coincidence to run into your grandson here!" I said quickly with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my words, Patrick immediately welcomed me into the house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old mansion had a classic four-square layout, appearing old yet well-kept. A smell of medicinal herbs wafted throughout the entire courtyard. In addition to that, there were many flowers and plants planted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick knew that since I had been recommended to him, there should be a purpose. So, after handing Byron over to his wife, he led me to his dispensary and gestured for me to sit down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm guessing correctly, you came over to see me for an illness, right?" Patrick asked gently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Doctor Cullen, to tell you the truth, I found out about congenital endometriosis some time ago. Here is my diagnostic report. I heard from my friend that you are a great doctor, so I wanted to see if you have any potential remedies."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly took out all my report and handed it to Patrick.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Patrick didn't even look at the report but said, "I don't read those reports. Show me your hand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's order was a clear consent to treat me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but feel ecstatic. Fiona had warned me that he might refuse to treat me even if I managed to locate him. I hadn't anticipated today to go so smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly reached out my hand. Patrick began to diagnose me. He pressed my right hand and then my left hand. He closed his eyes and meditated for a while before slowly saying, "Madam, your situation is indeed a bit complicated. If you want to get pregnant, it is not so simple, but..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of this, he suddenly paused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sensed the hope in his words, and instantly, my heart was in my throat. I hastened to ask, "Doctor Cullen, is there something you can do? I have heard that you are an authority in this field."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="268.html">« Prev</a><a href="270.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
