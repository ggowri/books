I dropped my Bluetooth earphones, but I just found them," he waved the white earphones in his hand in front of me, and then returned to his own seat, fastened his seatbelt, and sat back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His actions made me feel a little strange, but since it seemed like he just wanted to find something and not do anything to me, I didn't delve into it and went back to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The journey of two and a half hours was not long. Before long, while still in my sleep, I heard the flight attendant's announcement that the plane would soon be landing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking off my eye mask, I opened my eyes and found Elliott lying on the seat next to me. He was dozing off, with one hand clenched and supporting his head. His head was slightly tilted, and from my perspective, I could see the entire profile of his side face. His sleeping posture was calm and peaceful, probably too tired to be </span><span>awakened by the flight attendant's announcement, only slightly furrowing his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, in this way, seemed to have relaxed, no longer approaching me like before, crazily forcing me to reconcile, and repeatedly asking me if I really loved him... However, this sudden relaxation made me feel somewhat uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at his face for a few seconds. Initially, I was just curious about his sudden calmness. However, unexpectedly, he suddenly opened his eyes, and those sharp and profound eyes immediately locked onto mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were sitting next to each other, close in proximity. Suddenly, he woke up and stared at me, which startled me for a moment. I hastily averted my gaze and pretended to look ahead, but I heard him softly say with a half-smile, "It seems like you've been watching me all along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing, I just happened to turn my head and you woke up," I said hastily, anxiously tucking the stray hair in front of my forehead behind my ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't speak, he just laughed softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I heard the sound of him raising the seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plane was descending at this time, and suddenly there was a strong turbulence due to the air current.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively grabbed the armrest of the seat and realized that I was feeling a bit dizzy. So, I tightly closed my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, I thought it was just a normal turbulence, but little did I know, the plane started to shake more and more violently. Meanwhile, the flight attendants were continuously transmitting information through the broadcast. It turned out that there was a severe thunderstorm over Edulet City at that moment, making the landing of the plane somewhat difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The frequent ups and downs caused a reaction in my body. I broke out in a cold sweat and my body involuntarily tensed up. I fearfully grabbed onto the armrest tightly, and at that moment, the plane suddenly jolted even more violently, startling me and causing me to let out a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A warm palm, at this moment, suddenly grasped my hand firmly. Before I could react, a magnetic and deep voice came through. "It's okay. Don't be afraid. I'm right beside you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice seemed to carry a force, along with the warmth of his palm, transmitting it to my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to his previous detestable attitude, the restored Elliott, who reverted to his true nature, did not disgust me as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was only that I didn't dislike him as much, I still resisted his approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to free my hand from his palm, but the constantly shaking plane made me hesitate to make any sudden movements.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="723.html">« Prev</a><a href="725.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
