Does it hurt?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his gaze to meet mine, his eyes filled with profound regret. Gently, he began to massage my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, my eyes filled with terror and confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, the sudden turn of events had me spooked. Even now, I'm still a bit dazed, clueless about what exactly went down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That crude man once again let loose a string of profanities:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, this woman had the audacity to splash her drink on me, she's asking for it. Mr. Bryant, I'd advise you to stay out of this mess! Or else, I won't be so polite!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, he knew who Elliott was, yet he remained so audaciously arrogant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rodriguez, this is Hoswich City, not Mexico. It's not a place where you can just do as you please. Everyone's here to enjoy the party tonight, I'd advise you not to stir up trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott held me tightly against him, then he coolly addressed the man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Rodriguez? Mexico?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly dawned on me, this man was none other than Diego Rodr&iacute;guez, the head honcho of Mexico's most powerful military faction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had previously invested in this film and gathered a lot of information about Mexico, so I had seen his picture in the materials. No wonder he looked so familiar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man is ruthless and brutal, with a violent temperament. Not only does he control a vast array of underground industries in Mexico, but he also openly operates several hotels and entertainment clubs. Additionally, he maintains a private army. Presumably, these intruders in "camouflage" are members of his mercenary force.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, women are dime a dozen, but business opportunities aren't. Are you sure you want to cross me over this woman tonight?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diego Rodr&iacute;guez pointed at me, a smug grin plastered on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze bore into mine, a savage glint in his eyes, as if he was ready to be my sworn enemy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can do business with anyone, but her, I must protect!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wasn't fazed by the other party's aggressive behavior.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he spoke without a hint of fear. All the while, he held my hand tightly in public, shielding me within his embrace, as if he wouldn't allow anyone to harm me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blatant defense of me was somewhat surprising. The terror I had just experienced was instantly replaced by an overwhelming sense of security.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Dalton finally made it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon witnessing the scene, he was taken aback, hastily addressing Diego Rodr&iacute;guez:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rodriguez, what's going on here? Everyone present is an esteemed guest of mine. Mr. Rodriguez, this is Ms. Mayers from Glory Group, the one I've mentioned to you before. Was there some sort of misunderstanding just now? Mr. Rodriguez, could you ask your men to step out for a moment? If there's any confusion, let's all sit down and talk it out. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only after Dalton's explanation that I understood why Diego Rodr&iacute;guez was here.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="851.html">« Prev</a><a href="853.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
