She saw us from a distance, waved, and ran toward us across the snowy ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slow down. Be careful not to fall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her carelessness, I quickly stepped forward and supported her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'm very flexible. Even though I'm pregnant, I don't feel tired at all. You guys came just in time. Before Christmas, I bought sweet potatoes, potatoes, and taro from the villagers nearby. I even got some marshmallow. We can grill them and eat by the fire. It must be fun!" Paige said with a smile and led me into the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was my most humorous friend. She actually named her motel "Holly Villa". The name alone made me both amused and confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The motel was located at the foot of the mountain, not far from a small village. There were walls surrounding the motel, and Paige placed a large signboard at the entrance. After entering, there are several rooms arranged around the large courtyard in the middle. The other side was Paige's gardens, covering several acres.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of the snow last night, thick snow covered the green plants and ditches in the yard. The original appearance of the yard was no longer visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the snow covered the winding pine branches, and a few red plum blossoms bloomed beautifully in the corner of the yard, adding a touch of red to the white snow world, which looked quite charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige took us to the east side of the motel. It was a large kitchen with a modern integrated stove and a traditional stove. On one side of the house, she used a folding screen as a partition, and the fireplace over there was opened. There was a circle of stools around the fireplace and a small round table for coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling cold, we immediately sat down around the fireplace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the fragrance of marshmallow wafted over. It turned out that Paige specially put a few marshmallows on fire and grill. Not long after, the marshmallows began to bubble and exuded a sweet smell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The layout here is pretty good. How is the business?" After taking a tour by himself, Quinn walked in and asked Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's going well so far since it opened. People from the city come in droves for vacation. After staying in the big city for a long time, people love to go to the countryside to relax," Paige replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The land here is fertile, and it's good to grow herbs." As a person in the pharmaceutical industry, Marcus couldn't help but bring the topic to his professional field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? If you say so, we can consider cooperating to grow some herbs. I have several acres of land nearby. I was thinking if I couldn't think of anything good to grow, I'd temporarily rent it to nearby villagers," Paige continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Paige finished speaking, Philip, who had been silent suddenly said, "It is said that there are too many new influenza patients in Catage, and the city has been ordered to lockdown. Did you hear the news?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lockdown?" We were all stunned when we heard that word. Everyone immediately turned on their phones. Almost at the same time, the same news popped up on everyone's mobile phone screen, just like what Philip had said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="492.html">« Prev</a><a href="494.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
