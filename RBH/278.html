So, I'm starting to make amends from now on. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped his arms around me, cradled my face, and softly posed the question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined he had taken my diary.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more surprising was that he had actually taken the time to read its contents. That must be why he sang my favorite song tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked into his eyes, feeling utterly surreal as if I was dreaming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've never sung in public before, and this is the first time I've done that. Do you think I'm serious?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't directly answer my question, but instead, countered with one of his own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, I had never heard him sing before, nor had I ever heard him play the piano. If not for tonight, I wouldn't have known he could play the piano so well and sing so beautifully.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really didn't expect it to be you, really."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but nestle my head against his chest again, my heart still trembling incessantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never received such attention from him before, so I couldn't calm down at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that the report would make me lose everything, and I never expected him to be willing to do this for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the first and only, so cherish it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled lightly, and there was a hint of mischief in his smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at his proud face, I couldn't help but lightly pound his chest. My fingers brushed over his Adam's apple, and at the same time, a hint of admiration filled my gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never knew you could sing so well."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott grabbed my hand and placed it on his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it? Then you better be a good girl. Perhaps, I'll sing for you more often in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were casual, but I could still see a hint of weariness in his expression. Even as someone who always cared about his appearance, he had a hint of stubble on his chin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, what about my condition..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I thought of this issue, the more anxious I became.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll find a way to deal with it, don't worry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dismissed it lightly, seemingly unconcerned about the issue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but feel emotional. In the last life, he was cold and heartless to me, but in this life, he was much warmer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that a man could really change this much when he loved someone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my last life, he didn't love me, so he always treated me with indifference, to the point where I never saw this tender and serious side of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I vaguely remembered that in the last life, he had also thrown such a grand birthday celebration for Giselle. That day, Giselle looked like a princess, and her happiness was no less than mine now. But at that time, I was like a clown abandoned in the corner, with no way out except silently crying alone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the pain I experienced in the last life and the happiness I felt at this moment, I suddenly felt that everything he did for me today was already enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, as long as Elliott cared about me, Giselle wouldn't be able to do anything. After all, in love, the one who isn't loved is the third party. Through Elliott's performance tonight, I could be sure that I had won and Giselle lost.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, a strange sense of accomplishment and satisfaction prompted me to tilt my head and look at him affectionately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This one look, like a spark, ignited Elliott's desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He became restless as his breath grew heavier. Then, he combed his hands through my hair and kissed my slightly swollen lips forcefully once again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="277.html">« Prev</a><a href="279.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
