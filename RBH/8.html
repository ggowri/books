I had spent my life loving him before. In this life, I wouldn&#x27;t be a joke in anyone&#x27;s eyes.</p><p>Maybe my completely different attitude embarrassed Elliott.</p><p>His expression became more sullen. He walked towards me with a glare.</p><p>He grabbed my chin and warned, &quot;Madeline, I don&#x27;t know about your tricks, but if you keep challenging me, you know the consequences!&quot;</p><p>How ridiculous! I had accepted the worst consequences calmly. What consequences should I be afraid of?</p><p>I sneered, held his wrist, and said, &quot;If you mean a divorce, then okay. I&#x27;ve given you the divorce papers. We can divorce whenever you want.&quot;</p><p>Elliott was irritated more. He forced me to sit on the edge of the pool table and tightened his grip on my chin.</p><p>With a look of rage, he said, &quot;Do you think you can make me miserable with a divorce? Madeline, you overestimate yourself!&quot;</p><p>If my memory served well, this was one of the few times we were so close after our marriage. I could see the pores on his face and smell the perfume on his body.</p><p>In the past, my heart would pound whenever he came near me. Even if he scolded or yelled at me, I couldn&#x27;t help but be fascinated by him.</p><p>But now, I just felt an indescribable suffocation.</p><p>My face turned red. Elliott was so strong that I couldn&#x27;t breathe or speak.</p><p>However, he didn&#x27;t mean to kill me.</p><p>Seeing my painful look, he let me go, pointed at the door, and growled, &quot;Go home now. You&#x27;re not allowed to set foot here again and wear like this!&quot;</p><p>He could blatantly date other women, but he even interfered with what I wore and where I should go.</p><p>This was unfair!</p><p>I didn&#x27;t care about the divorce, let alone what he said.</p><p>&quot;Sorry, I can&#x27;t do it,&quot; I replied calmly.</p><p>Then, I walked past him and winked at Quinn.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Woods, shall we play another round?&quot; I asked.</p><p>&quot;Madeline Bryant!&quot; Elliott roared.</p><p>However, I ignored him and kept indicating Quinn to continue with my eyes.</p><p>&quot;Okay. I haven&#x27;t gotten a match in billiards yet. Let&#x27;s continue.&quot;</p><p>I just wanted to use Quinn to make Elliott angry. Quinn was Elliott&#x27;s friend. I had been mentally prepared that he would reject me.</p><p>To my surprise, Quinn, who used to despise me, intentionally got close to me tonight. He nodded and walked towards me with two pool cues.</p><p>I had stayed away from alcohol for a long time. Having drank a lot of wine in box No. 8, I was getting a little drunk now.</p><p>When I was about to take the cue from Quinn, I suddenly felt dizzy. Shaking unconsciously, I bumped into the corner of the pool table.</p><p>Quinn subconsciously held my waist. The next second, I fell into his arms unconsciously.</p><p>I wore a short T-shirt. Now, my waist was completely exposed. Quinn put his hands on my waist, making me feel hot. My face blushed.</p><p>At that moment, when I realized that Elliott was not far away, out of revenge, I subconsciously put my arms around Quinn&#x27;s neck.</p><p>Elliott usually flirted with other women like that, which broke my heart and made me be an unreasonable lunatic and be ridiculed.</p><p>Now, I wanted him to know how it felt to be humiliated in public.</p><p>Quinn and I hugged in front of everyone. We were so close that I saw Quinn staring at me with undisguised concern.</p><p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p><p>Quinn managed to steady me. Only after he was sure that I stood firmly did he let go.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m fine.&quot;</p><p>I stood still, my heart beating a little faster under his affectionate gaze.</p><p>I felt more and more strange...</p><p>In the last life, Quinn was my sworn enemy. Why did he treat me like a completely different person?</p><p>I was wondering when a deafening cracking sound came from the box.</p><p>Before I could react, someone pulled me hard. Then, I staggered and fell into another person&#x27;s arms.</p><p>The familiar scent of perfume reached my nose. I lifted my head and found Elliott.</p><p>He was very angry,  &quot;Madeline, who gave you permission to go around seducing men!&quot;</p><p><span style="color:#222222"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="background-color:#ffffff">&quot;You&#x27;re so cheap and slutty!&quot;</span></span></span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="7.html">« Prev</a><a href="9.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
