Damn</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>w</span><span>hat a terrible night," complained the man who took a punch, lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who cares who he is! Let's all go in together. If we don't finish this task tonight, we won't get any money this month!" Another man wiped his nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing only Elliott alone, they immediately showed fierce expressions on their faces and rushed forward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay behind me and don't move, I'll handle this," Elliott whispered to me, then shoved me behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly delivered powerful punches, engaging in a brawl with the several men surrounding us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never seen Elliott so fierce before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that in the last fight with Quinn, he had simply been showing mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly had combat training. Every punch he threw was fast and heavy. These thugs Jade had brought were no match for him at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it had been a long time since he had fought like this, but he only grew fiercer with each blow. He didn't even take these men seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took off his suit jacket and handed it to me. Then, relying on his brave attacks and agile dodges, he quickly subdued each of them, leaving them lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Quinn and the police arrived at the scene, those men were already lying on the ground, unable to move, bleeding and moaning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I helped my mom untie the ropes, guided her to the couch, and covered her with a blanket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom had always lived a comfortable life and had never experienced such a scare before. She was still shaken, lying on the couch and crying incessantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the surveillance cameras, everything that happened was captured, and the police could investigate and gather evidence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They immediately escorted the thugs away for interrogation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the living room, it was soon just my mom, Elliott, and me left. Seeing Elliott there, Quinn didn't say much and took the injured bodyguard directly to the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, it's okay now, it's okay, don't be scared," I quickly reassured my mom as she trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was so scary, who were those people? Why did they break into our house? It was terrifying!" My mom clutched </span><span>my hands</span><span>, still trembling with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe the police will investigate soon, as long as you're okay. Mom, let me help you to your room to rest. You should sleep for a while and try not to think about anything else," I said softly to my mom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew she was extremely frightened, so I didn't tell her about Jade's involvement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together with Elliott, we helped her upstairs, and I comforted her until she finally calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been taking care of my dad a lot lately, hardly getting any good sleep, so with my reassurance, she slowly drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sighed deeply and then came out of my mom's bedroom with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, we exchanged glances. For a moment, both of us looked a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know something happened at my home?" I asked instinctively, puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's okay if I don't ask that, but the moment I did, his face darkened instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can think of Quinn, but not me. Is he the closest person to you in your heart?" Elliott asked coldly, then without saying another word, he went downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his tall, strong figure and the bloodstains on his pristine shirt, I realized that despite his toughness, he had still faced multiple opponents, resulting in external injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately followed him downstairs. He was sitting on my sofa, just rolling up his sleeves.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="319.html">« Prev</a><a href="321.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
