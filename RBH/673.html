What did she want to do to you? Is your stomach hurting? Do you need to go to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Sylvia's words, Quinn's tone became increasingly tense. His eyes scanned me up and down incessantly, afraid that I might make the slightest mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, my stomach didn't hurt. Just now I went to the bathroom and coincidentally ran into Nicole. She locked me up here like a mad dog and even wanted to harm me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly explained the situation just now so that Quinn wouldn't worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I remind you before that you should never be alone no matter where you go? Why didn't you call me when you just went to the bathroom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, upon hearing me say this, became even more worried. He couldn't help but complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw you chatting with other people all the time, and besides, the restroom was so close to the banquet hall, so I thought it would be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pretended to smile casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You turned pale, how could everything be fine? If it wasn't for Ms. Hart being there today, think about what kind of danger you would have faced. From now on, you are not allowed to leave my sight more than 2 feet, understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn pretended to be angry and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't mind at all that Sylvia was right next to him, still expressing his concern for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia clearly noticed something. She glanced around, but didn't say anything. She just patted my shoulder with a hint of envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers is really lucky to have such a considerate and handsome boyfriend. Since you're fine, I'll go back first. You guys can chat slowly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Sylvia finished speaking, she flirtatiously tossed her curly hair and then walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hart, I will keep today's events in my heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said to Sylvia's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was a piece of cake, so you really didn't need to take it to heart, Ms. Mayers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Sylvia finished speaking, she then opened the door to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her surprise, just at the moment she opened the door, someone suddenly sprayed something at her from outside the door!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, Sylvia, who was still charming, suddenly covered her face and let out a scream. At the same time, some residual liquid splashed onto my hand, and I immediately felt a faint stinging sensation on the back of my hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You despicable person! I just spared you, and yet you dare to repay me with ingratitude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia immediately burst out cursing. At the same time, she covered her face and appeared particularly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Nicole about to slip away, Quinn immediately crossed over Sylvia and chased after her, grabbing Nicole's hand without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just sprinkle? Speak up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn shouted loudly at Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I hurriedly walked up to Sylvia and found that her face had suddenly turned red and swollen. This indicates that the liquid Nicole sprayed just now was highly potent, far from being an ordinary liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you splash? Is it sulfuric acid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so shocked that I shouted out, and at that moment, Sylvia was already in so much pain that she couldn't even stand properly. She covered her face and rolled on the ground in agony.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="672.html">« Prev</a><a href="674.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
