"It's sweet," he smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly broke away from his hand, then forked another piece and handed it to his mouth. I knew he liked joking around, but I didn't argue with him. "Eat more then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fed Quinn piece by piece. Not long after, he finished all the apples and yogurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled and joked, "How many days have you not eaten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The people surrounding me just now are all guys. They are not as considerate as you, let alone feed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn laughed and looked at me, a little moved. Before I could say anything, he said, "This is the first time I have been fed by a woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he was talking nonsense. "I don't believe it. Have you never been in love? No woman has been nice to you? How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I hadn't interacted with him much in my previous life, I remembered that he and Philip liked fooling around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Quinn ran a club and must have spent much time with women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell you what, many women threw themselves at me. After all, I'm very attractive. But I have never been in love. I've only been in a relationship when I was in college."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled and winked at me with a narcissistic look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Then tell me, why did you break up with your first love?" I smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, I didn't know much about Quinn's past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just asked casually and didn't expect his face to suddenly turn sullen and his tone to become serious. "She got leukemia and passed away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn had always been cheerful and seemed to have no worries. I never thought that he had such a sad past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry. I didn't expect..." I apologized hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head and said slowly, "She was my college classmate, a wonderful girl. She was lively, motivated, and lovely, and she loved me very much. If it weren't for her disease, we would have gotten married after graduation. But in my junior year, she was diagnosed with leukemia and passed away in less than a year. Sometimes, I really don't understand why such a wonderful girl was so unlucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's face was etched with depression. Apparently, he was immersed in the sad past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how to comfort him. I patted him on the shoulder and said, "I don't know what to say. Anyway, it's in the past, and she's gone. Don't be too sad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled bitterly, "I know, but since then, I have lost my vision for love, and I can't start a new relationship at all. I've been thinking about her over the years. I founded Red Star Charity and do charity everywhere because this is her dream."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh, right. I stared at Quinn. For a moment, I couldn't think of anything to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that people who seemed to be ruthless were often the most devoted.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="509.html">« Prev</a><a href="511.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
