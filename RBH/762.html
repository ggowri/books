He knows who I am. Thanks."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's a slight curiosity stirring within me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, Ms. Mayers, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, she knew who I was. And when she asked if I was Ms. Mayers, her voice noticeably heightened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, who might you be?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My curiosity grew even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you in a bit, friend of Mr. Bryant."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After uttering those words, the woman promptly hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a bit taken aback, but didn't dwell on it. Upon reaching Bryant Hospital, I walked straight in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still in the process of recovery, I deliberately donned a long black coat, adding a houndstooth scarf around my neck for good measure. I topped it off with a beret and slipped on a pair of sunglasses. With a determined stride, I made my way towards Elliott's private hospital room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I stepped out of the elevator, a tall woman was striding in my direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she stepped into the elevator on the other side. Before I could get a good look at her, she had already disappeared inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was clad in a silver trench coat, her bare feet slipped into high heels. Beneath the coat, I caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a deep green blouse. Her hair was styled into short, soft curls. Tall and slender, she moved with an air of authority that compelled passersby to steal a second glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even between the same sex, there are times when attraction sparks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively halted, casting a glance over my shoulder. To my surprise, I was immediately taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the elevator doors closed swiftly, I could still clearly see the woman inside. Astonishingly, her face bore a striking resemblance to mine!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this woman possibly be the same one I encountered at that vacation hotel in Norch City last time?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, why would she suddenly show up here?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was left in a state of utter bewilderment, yearning to dig deeper. But the woman had already taken the elevator down, leaving me in the dust. And the worst part? I had no clue who she was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, you've finally arrived. I've been waiting for your call for days."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still in a daze when Barry's voice echoed from behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without bothering to greet Barry, I immediately pointed towards the elevator and asked him:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, who was that woman who just stepped into the elevator?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry paused for a moment, pushing up the glasses perched on the bridge of his nose:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, which woman?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly scanned the floor, my previous visits to Bryant Hospital had made me well aware that this level was off-limits to the public, reserved exclusively for the treatment of the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Barry must know who this woman is. And when he answered my question, he couldn't meet my gaze. This clearly indicates that he's trying to hide something from me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fixed my gaze on Barry, flashing him a cryptic smile, and took a couple of steps towards him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, I had Barry spooked like a deer caught in headlights. He hastily retreated two steps, nervously adjusting the glasses perched on his nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, you know how I am. If you don't spill it soon, I'm outta here&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I narrowed my eyes, leaning in close to Barry, deliberately putting on a stern face to spook him.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="761.html">« Prev</a><a href="763.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
