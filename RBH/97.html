Now, occasionally, when I bring up divorce, Elliott becomes unhappy instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The scenery here was indeed nice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I timely changed the topic and turned my head to appreciate the beautiful scenery here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were currently on the rooftop terrace of the Hoswich Tower. Besides the lawn and green plants, there was a moon-shaped pool on the terrace. The pool shimmered with a dreamy silver light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are not many dining tables here, but each seat is separated by white curtains. The firefly-like small lights emit a faint yellow-green glow, making the entire restaurant look exceptionally romantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a glance around, Elliott whispered, "If you like, I can take you to more unique restaurants in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like Elliott really wanted to spend happy days with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, having experienced the previous life, it is difficult for me now to believe in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving a casual answer, I lowered my head and continued to savor the delicacies on my plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott voluntarily placed a steak onto my plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next Monday, a group of guests from Dikio will be visiting the Bryant Group for an inspection. I will entertain them well. Will you accompany me in receiving them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Dikio's inspection team?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My brain quickly spun. I distinctly remember, in the previous life, there was indeed such an event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, this group of inspectors came to the Bryant Group for investigation. I originally wanted to accompany Elliott, but he disagreed and asked Sylvia to accompany him, which led to the media spreading rumors about him and Sylvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Elliott succeeded in getting the collaboration, but his parents called me to their residence, the Bryant Villa, to criticize me. They believed that even though I had been married to Elliott for two years, I did not accompany him to such important occasions. Instead, an actress stole my thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remember that night when they cursed every word I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since that night, Elliott's parents have become even more dissatisfied with me. And because I have still not become pregnant, they can no longer hide their dissatisfaction with me. Laura even personally called my mother to blame her for not raising me as a well-mannered daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those criticisms still remain fresh in my memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I even felt more inferior and useless because of this. Other women married into wealthy families and gave birth to children. Even if some women were not compatible with their husbands, they could pretend to be loving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I, however, failed to grab Elliott's sleeve and could only watch as he was rumored to be involved with someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I didn't use any means, but Elliott took the initiative to ask me if I wanted to accompany him in receiving these distinguished guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm thrilled and have learned a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some things are really like sand. The more you try to hold onto them, the more they slip away. If you simply discard the sand, they end up piling into a tower.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="96.html">« Prev</a><a href="98.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
