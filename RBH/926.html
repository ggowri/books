I finally managed to break free from her embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. Some jerk tried to harass me at the bar, but Elliott saved me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I explained to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, even though I was telling the truth, I felt a bit guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That convenient? Elliott, were you just waiting around to save Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, always blunt and having a grudge against Elliott, asked pointedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it was just a coincidence. Orson invited me to that bar. I arrived just in time to see Madeline being harassed. Maybe it was fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson nodded immediately, "Yeah, I invited my brother to the bar. I had no idea my sister-in-law was also in Korea and friends with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, it must be fate. But if it was a planned rescue, Elliott, I advise you to stop trying to win Madeline over with these tricks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona also wore a stern expression. Clearly, like Paige, she believed there was something deliberate about all this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's words prompted Paige to immediately chime in:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Madeline is doing great now, her career is thriving. Ever since she left you, her life has been carefree. If you can't make her happy, it's best to stay away and not create unnecessary ties to mess with her heart.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why they were my best friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they showed up, they stood by me without hesitation, willing to offend Elliott rather than see me suffer because of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a wave of emotion and instinctively gripped their arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's expression was calm, showing no emotion, but his eyes were sincere:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I know Madeline is excellent and independent now, very different from before. That's why she's worth pursuing and waiting for. I know you don't trust me, but I'll prove myself and make you feel comfortable entrusting her to me.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's words left Paige and Fiona exchanging shocked glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott never valued me like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to ignore me and never acknowledged my best friends. Even when we had to meet, he'd just put on a show and then go about his business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His current sincere and humble attitude stunned Paige and Fiona, making them forget their prepared lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I ordered a lot of food. If we don't eat soon, it'll get cold. You must be hungry after looking for Madeline all night. Please, sit down and eat something.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott warmly invited us, even pulling out chairs for each of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige coughed deliberately, regaining her composure, </span><span>"</span><span>We are hungry, but don't think a Korean meal will win us over and make us speak for you, Elliott.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her words, Paige sat down and immediately grabbed a piece of fried chicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona pulled me to sit as well. Seeing this, Elliott sat across from us, and Orson followed suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked closely at Elliott and Orson. They did resemble each other, but Orson, though handsome, lacked Elliott's charm and presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they weren't sitting together, Orson would seem quite attractive, but side by side, the difference was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I compared them, Fiona thought I was being infatuated again and pinched me hard under the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I yelped and turned to see Fiona glaring at me, whispering angrily in my ear:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Madeline, get a grip! Don't let him fool you again!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh at Fiona's expression and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona immediately turned to Elliott, lowering her voice to a cold tone:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott, we saw how you treated Madeline before. Honestly, she endured a lot with you. Do you agree?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott nodded, looking like he was admitting guilt:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Yes, I know.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona, encouraged, knocked on the table, her voice even colder:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If you know, you shouldn't bother her again! What makes you think Madeline needs you? Who gave you that confidence? Let me tell you, Madeline has suitors lined up from Hoswich City to Louis City. She can have any man she wants. Giving you up, she gained a whole forest. Don't think you're special. To Madeline, you're history. Right, Madeline?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's sudden mention of me caught me off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I intended to stay quiet and let my friends speak for me, but Fiona's unexpected cue left me unprepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona, frustrated, stepped on my foot again. I quickly nodded:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Yes, I have many suitors, all kinds. I'm quite popular now, that's true.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said it casually, matching my expression, but I had no confidence inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, after the divorce, I met many men, but only through work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, with pregnancy and childbirth, I had no suitors. Fiona was just bluffing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, looked tense, his tone urgent:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Really? Who else besides Quinn?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott's concern, Paige raised her voice:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Too many to count. Madeline has looks, a great figure, and a successful career. Men love her. Elliott, you know the saying: 'You ignored her before, now you can't reach her.' So give up. Madeline will never go back to you!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was blunt and straightforward, her words piercing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face turned pale, his lips white, </span><span>"</span><span>I know I was wrong before. Now, I just hope Madeline gives me one more chance. If I fail again, I promise never to bother her.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Elliott spoke, he looked at me deeply, his eyes full of longing and guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was like a black hole, almost pulling my soul in. I nearly got lost in his deep eyes again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Korean breeze kept my mind clear this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Whether I give you a chance isn't up to me alone. It's up to my family and friends. Elliott, if you really want to win me back, you need their approval too.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing my friends had my back, I chose not to face this alone and pushed them forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>How about this: I'll cover all your expenses in Korea for the next few days. Not only that, I'll personally guide you and provide five-star service. Can I have this chance to prove myself?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was quick-witted. Instead of replying, he took immediate action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Paige and Fiona were stunned again. They exchanged glances and almost simultaneously said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're willing, that'd be great!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="925.html">« Prev</a><a href="927.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
