Madeline is indeed pregnant. She must never drink again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona nodded, saying with great certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's expression froze for a moment. He slowly turned to look at me. Seeing that I was in a daze, he stretched out his hand to wave it before me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline? Are you OK? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, I came to my senses. I looked at him and then looked at Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the moment there were tears in Fiona's eyes, I couldn't control my emotions and cried instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My voice was choked, feeling everything just like a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, am I really pregnant? It's unbelievable! It turns out I can be a mother..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Doctor Louis informed me that I could not have children. I remembered how I felt hopeless after knowing the result. Now, this sudden surprise made me think that life was indeed fully changeable. At the same time, my feelings were complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's true. Your wish in these years has finally come true! Do you want to call Elliott and ask him to come over? If he knew about this, he would probably go crazy with joy, right? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona kept nodding. After the excitement, she couldn't help taking out her mobile phone to call Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she was about to dial the number, I hurriedly pressed her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, don't do that! Don't tell him! We are getting divorced soon! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head hastily. I was so anxious that I blurted it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divorce? Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona shivered in shock and looked at me in disbelief. After hearing my words, Alexis, who had been standing by silently, couldn't help walking over and looking at me with confusion. But he was always not much of a talker, so he said nothing with a surprised expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is a long story. Anyway, I don't hope others know that I'm pregnant. Quinn, Alexis, can you keep it a secret for me? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled bitterly. I didn't explain to Fiona at once because I was more worried that they would tell Elliott about my pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subconsciously, I looked towards Quinn and Alexis. After seeing my expression, Quinn instantly understood my purpose and nodded. However, Alexis was even more confused at this time, so she couldn't help asking,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you are pregnant, which is a big deal, so we should tell Elliott about it. Why...? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Halfway through the question, Alexis stopped. Maybe it was out of the rigor of his profession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn patted Alexis' shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Recently, she had a complicated relationship with Elliott. So, please stop asking. Let's respect Madeline's choice first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't speak much, but Alexis understood. He nodded and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"OK."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all promised to keep it a secret for me. And I also gradually calmed down from the excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, I looked at my belly. I felt it was amazing that there was a baby in my belly, unaware.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I made a major decision in my mind at once. That was, I would absolutely give birth to this child at all costs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, I couldn't let anyone in the Bryant family know that I was pregnant, including Elliott.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="438.html">« Prev</a><a href="440.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
