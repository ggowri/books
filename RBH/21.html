Cautiousness will ensure long-term development. Since Madeline insists on doing the project 'Do Not Love', let's give it a try! As for big productions like 'Allure', we can wait until we gain experience and then make such dramas."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin made the final decision at last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meeting was finally coming to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had received the project proposal for "Do Not Love" and at the same time, Austin also entrusted me with the responsibility for this project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood that Austin's decision this time was not only to try out the film and television industry but also to train me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meeting ended, I tidied up the materials and wanted to go to the top floor of Glory Group for some fresh air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as I pushed open the small door on the top floor and was about to step onto the terrace, I heard the voices of Jade and my uncle, Tom Mayers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, it seems like Madeline has suddenly changed recently. She has started getting involved in the company's business, and this is not a good thing if it continues!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She didn't know anything. She was just curious. Just wait and see, she couldn't last for half a month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Dad, she is different now, like a different person, not as easy to fool as before. Ever since she started working at the company, Austin's attitude towards me has also changed. Now he supports her. You missed the meeting just now. She has been constantly opposing me, and Austin, of all people, supports her. It really infuriates me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's watch it for a while. If what you say is true, we might have to take action sooner, considering that she has the Bryant family backing her up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bryant family didn't pay much attention to her. It's just that Sylvia is really useless. She has been close to Elliott for so long, but there hasn't been any substantial progress. If things continue like this, we don't know when Elliott will finally divorce Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do have another idea to deal with Madeline..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tom's voice suddenly lowered at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood at the side door, wanting to listen carefully to what he would say next, but unfortunately, a gust of wind blew at that moment, and I didn't hear clearly what he was saying to Jade. However, I could vaguely sense that they seemed to be planning to come after me next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, I did not hear their plan clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footsteps grew closer, and it was evident that they had already worked out a plan and were walking towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I went downstairs now, they would see me. In desperation, I quickly dodged behind the small door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, few people come up to this terrace, and only those who worked in the top-floor office had access to it. Therefore, they were unguarded and never expected me behind the door. They walked down the stairs one after the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at Tom's back, and at that moment, my heart was filled with mixed feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was growing up, besides my parents, Tom actually loved me the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I was a child, he would always bring me delicious food and fun things whenever he went on a business trip. He would also often take me to amusement parks. Every year on my birthday, he would prepare a birthday surprise for me. He cared for me more than he did for his own daughter Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I always thought he was the best uncle in the world, but little did I know, he had been pretending all along when faced with immense interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What were they going to do to me next?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know, but I kept telling myself in my heart that no matter what, I must be extremely careful in whatever I would do next and wherever I would go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a breath on the terrace for a while, I returned to the office and immersed myself in studying the project proposal for "Do Not Love".</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="20.html">« Prev</a><a href="22.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
