Then, Elliott crawled into the cup.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He switched off the lights in the room. Only the small bedside lamp, which I had once scavenged from abroad, remained lit. The lamp cast a multicolored glow, bathing the room in a spectrum of five different hues. Suddenly, the atmosphere in the room took on an air of ambiguity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seems like he hasn't thrown away a single thing I bought in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder he's developed insomnia, spending night after night here, haunted by memories.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inwardly, I was musing. Yet, my eyes remained tightly shut. My body was immobile, but my consciousness was gradually awakening. So, I had no choice but to feign sleep to dodge the awkwardness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, I found myself somewhat grateful that he was the one who picked me up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were Quinn caught in an unexpected situation, I wouldn't know how to face him afterwards. It would only leave me more torn between a rock and a hard place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Elliott and I were once married. He was, to this day, my first man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, at this moment, even though I'm embarrassed, I'm still pretty grateful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, I can't help but wonder, how did he just happen to show up at Quinn's club tonight? Is this a coincidence?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm in the dark.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott extended his arm. Just like before, he pulled me into a tight embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the dim, hazy light, he turned my face towards him. I kept my eyes shut, too scared to move, but I could still feel his intense gaze studying my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After such a long time apart, the two of them found themselves lying together once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We lay together in our old room, clad in our old matching pajamas. Everything seemed as if it had never changed, yet, everything had.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My calm heart is experiencing some ripples now, a mix of complex emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I kept my eyes shut, because I honestly didn't know how to face Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of staring at me, suddenly, I felt a chill on my forehead. He had gently kissed me there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, I heard him murmur softly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I'm in love with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart nearly stopped dead in its tracks because of these few words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of tingles washed over my entire body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was caught off guard. He chose this moment to confess his feelings for me. And in my memory, he had never before uttered these three words so clearly and directly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really thought I was asleep, didn't he?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he uttered those words, he pulled me into his arms with a satisfied grin. Soon, I could hear the steady rhythm of his breathing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His affection was so profound, yet so restrained. It made me question, for a moment, whether he had truly lost his memory.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I distinctly remember him being quite wild in the past. He had absolutely no control over his desires.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, his performance left me stunned and bewildered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But regardless, the restrained Elliott was far more acceptable to me than his wild side. So, in this moment, as he held me, I felt no repulsion. Instead, I was enveloped in a long-lost sense of warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a solitary slumber on a frigid winter's night, the warmth and comfort she feels when she finally shares her bed with someone else is undeniable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar scent enveloped me, providing an extraordinary sense of security. Before long, a wave of intense drowsiness washed over me.
