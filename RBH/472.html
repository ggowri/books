Marcus paused for a moment, then continued, "Why are you so eager to collaborate with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively wanted to explain, but then thought better of it. If I told him it was because I knew in advance that this drug would be effective against the imminent outbreak of the new strain of influenza, he might wonder where I got the information from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that had been the case, I wouldn't have been able to explain. At the time, no one knew that this flu was a new strain, and it was still in the early stages of the outbreak. No one could predict it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I trust your character and your medical skills. I feel that since you put in so much effort to develop this drug, it must have something worth investing in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, changing the subject subconsciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing my words, Marcus' eyes suddenly lit up. At that moment, a hint of genuine admiration appeared in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I didn't expect you, who knows nothing about medicine, to understand my thoughts so well. To be honest, the formula for this drug is something I found in an old, tattered book. I encountered many difficulties in the early stages of development and invested a lot of energy. My ex-wife divorced me because I insisted on investing in this drug, which resulted in a considerable amount of debt for the family. She didn't have much faith in this project and thought I was crazy. But, I persisted in developing this drug. Do you know why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus spoke slowly, leaving me momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't expected that there would be such a story behind Marcus' development of this drug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" I asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The overuse of antibiotics is already a well-known fact in our country. While antibiotics can produce rapid results, they actually cause significant damage to the human body. Yet, despite this, antibiotics are still widely used in clinical medicine, even for many children with colds and fevers. Every time I see this, I feel heartbroken. But there are no other drugs on the market that can replace antibiotics, so I can't change this situation. However, when I saw the formula for this drug and tested it myself, I found that while the efficacy of this drug may not seem significant, it is very effective against sudden influenza outbreaks. More importantly, this drug has very few side effects and can be used by both adults and children. Therefore, after many trials, I decided to start developing this drug. I don't expect to profit from it, I just hope that the emergence of this drug can help more patients get rid of their dependence on antibiotics."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus explained as he sipped his coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, I couldn't help but admire him and gave him a thumbs up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, back when we were in school, your thinking was different from others. I didn't expect that after so many years, you would still be the same. Hearing you say that, I'm even more determined to do this with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled gently. He poured me another cup of coffee and then walked behind the bookshelf, took out a sample of the tablets, and handed them to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been getting colder lately. I heard there are many people with colds. Take this box of medicine back with you, just in case. In general, as long as you take this medicine continuously for one course, you should be able to recover basically, and it won't cause prolonged coughing like ordinary medicine."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="471.html">« Prev</a><a href="473.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
