I only knew that this play was eventually successfully aired and achieved tremendous success. Bryant Group also made a lot of money by investing in this movie. However, as for the behind-the-scenes dark forces, I didn't really give it much thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now Dalton mentioned this matter specifically, and now Elliott is emphasizing it to me again. Out of caution, I asked, "Since you say so, what do you mean by the hidden dark forces behind it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mexico is a country with a complex political situation. Apart from the official government, there are also warlords who occupy a significant amount of territory, making it difficult for the local government to intervene. Although Director Lewis' film has good casting and a patriotic theme, it involves some international secret transactions, and many of the masterminds behind these secret transactions are domestic entrepreneurs from our country. Director Lewis' perspective in this film is </span><span>good, but I'm afraid that once it is released, it will stir up a lot of trouble. Glory Group has just overcome a financial crisis and achieved stability. I think it's better for you not to take risks in investment." Elliott said slowly. His magnetic voice, combined with his logical analysis, instantly made me understand the pros and cons of this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this also made me vaguely remember that in the previous life, after this movie was broadcast, Elliott was suddenly kidnapped while on a business trip, and the place where it happened was exactly in the border area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know at the time what the reason was for his kidnapping, or who kidnapped him, because we had already divorced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I only knew that at that time, Giselle went alone to confront the gangsters in order to save him, and later got injured because of it. After that incident, Elliott's tenderness toward Giselle reached an unprecedented level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he give half of Bryant Group's shares to Giselle, but since then, wherever he went, Giselle was always by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his previous life, he loved Giselle deeply, to the point where it was ingrained in his bones... Even in this life, when I think about it, I still feel extremely uncomfortable, to the extent that even with him by my side at this very moment, I still feel nauseous, indescribably nauseous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is precisely because I have seen with my own eyes how he was able to love someone in his past life, to what extent he loved, that I am even more certain that he does not love me at all in this life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The amount of concern he has shown toward me so far is far less than one thousandth of what he showed toward Giselle in the previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already signed the contract, so it would be a big blow to Director Lewis if I break it now. It's okay. Since I made the choice, I will bear the consequences myself. Thank you for your kindness, but how did you know that I was having dinner with Director Lewis here?" After a few seconds of confusion, my emotions quickly returned to normal. Despite Elliott telling me all this, I still decided to continue working with Dalton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The moment Dalton stepped onto the plane, I received a warning from someone. The hidden dark forces may have thought he was coming to sign a contract with me, so they issued a warning to me. Madeline, you are likely to have been targeted by someone now, for safety reasons, I will arrange two bodyguards to accompany you," Elliott explained the reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I was mentally prepared for what he said, I still didn't expect the so-called dark forces behind the scenes to be so audacious. And this, in itself, is enough to show that Dalton's film did indeed harm certain people's interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said something extremely horrifying, to the point where I involuntarily felt a chill down my spine, as if there were a pair of eyes already fixed on me from behind, giving me a creepy sensation.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="714.html">« Prev</a><a href="716.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
