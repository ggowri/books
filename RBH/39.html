She bought me a bag and also gave me various membership cards and shopping cards. She even invited me several times to go with her for beauty treatments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did not expose her conspiracy and trickery. Now was not the best time to retaliate against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I accepted all her insincere hospitality. But I would never be foolish enough to let her manipulate me like before, and I would never again go out alone with her to do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to train me, my dad soon made me a project manager and put me in charge of all the work in the Film and Television Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I specifically established a project team for Do Not Love and assigned Adam to be in charge of team building. Soon, the project entered a busy preparation period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never worked before, but after entering the workplace, I quickly adapted to the role and situation. I would wear professional attire every day, shuttling between home and the office. For a while, I was extremely busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I no longer had time to think about love, nor did I have time to think about Elliott, whom I used to think about day and night in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A week later, as I walked out of Glory Group after work, to my astonishment, I saw Elliott's Lincoln limousine parked right at the main entrance of Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was dressed in a light gray designer suit, leaning diagonally against the front of the car with his hands in his pockets. The luxurious car accentuated his elegant and noble demeanor. His extremely handsome and charming face attracted numerous girls to stop and watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it's rare to see you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback for a moment when I saw him because I had never expected him to suddenly appear here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to pick you up from work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded slightly, and there was even a hint of a smile on his icy face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Then I was even more surprised."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback but remained calm as I walked up and stood in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked me up and down, and there flickered a hint of slight surprise in his eyes. He also rarely complimented me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You looked fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, I happened to be wearing a light gray silk shirt and black cropped pants with a pair of silver high heels. My hair, which reached my collarbone, was permed into loose curls. I wore green four-leaf clover earrings and a Vacheron Constantin watch on my wrist. Overall, this outfit looked pretty good on me because I had a nice figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to always belittle my dressing style in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He either despised me for dressing up too flamboyantly or thought that I dressed without any elegance or taste. In short, no matter what I wore in the past, he would criticize me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that was also normal. During those two years, I loved him so much that I lost myself. Every day, I would think carefully about his preferences and desperately try to align myself with them, to the point where I gradually lost myself. Even my dressing style became strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nowadays, I no longer needed to cater to anyone's preferences, and I dressed according to my feelings. Surprisingly, my current attire was unprecedentedly being praised by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I did not feel delighted when I heard such praise. I just smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You suddenly arrived today. What brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you forget about the mid-year banquet of the Bryant Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw I didn't remember it at all, so he cleared his throat and asked me with a furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, the banquet is coming so soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly opened my phone and glanced at the time, only to realize that the time for the mid-year banquet was already approaching. It's just tomorrow...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since the banquet was to be held tomorrow, why was he here now? What did he want?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="38.html">« Prev</a><a href="40.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
