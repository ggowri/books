How's he doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things are looking up. The clot in the brain has significantly reduced in size. It seems the recent treatment plan is working wonders. Hang in there, Ms. Mayers."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good to hear. Given the current progress, can the blood clot be eliminated in three months?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Judging by the current situation, it should be smooth sailing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving a definitive response from Dr. Muller, I breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a month has already passed in the three-month treatment course. Just two and a half more months to go. Once Elliott's condition improves, there won't be any more awkward situations like today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hung up the call and got back to work.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the afternoon was drawing to a close, my phone rang. It was Grey Woods on the other end. She said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, there's a high-society party at Lambo tonight. Everyone's been asking me to invite you. Are you free?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evening? Sure thing. But, Grey, who exactly do you mean by 'everyone'?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's all the socialites of Hoswich city! You'll see when you get here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey's hearty laughter echoed from the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's always been the hostess with the mostest, throwing all sorts of parties. She's invited me a few times before, but between having a baby and taking care of the little one, I've been swamped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, this party provides the perfect excuse to skip a trip to Serenity Villa and head home early to spend time with Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I accepted Grey's invitation and shot Elliott a message.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, I slipped into a spare lavender evening gown I had stashed in my office, applied a touch of sophisticated makeup, and headed off to Lambo.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lambo is a trendy, internet-famous restaurant that's currently all the rage in Hoswich city. The eatery is decked out in an overall pink hue, housed in a charming two-story building. The exterior is draped with wisteria and roses, giving it a touch of class.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, we had the place to ourselves. By the time I arrived, it was already teeming with socialites.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few short months, a slew of new faces had appeared. Among them, Lisa Fox caught my eye instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clad in a dark green sundress, her playful short hair making her head appear unusually small. The dress was tastefully elegant, accentuating her slender figure without compromising her charm. Her face was still heavily made up. At that moment, she was engaged in a lively conversation with a group of socialites.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, I seem to bump into her wherever I go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My good mood was instantly shattered. I grabbed a glass of champagne and stood in the corner, silently watching her performance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of nowhere, Grey Woods appeared, casually slinging an arm around my shoulder, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little beauty, even after having a child, your figure is still so stunning. No wonder Quinn can't get you out of his mind!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Woods family are all unique in their own ways, each with their own distinct characteristics. However, interacting with them always feels incredibly easygoing, and the same goes for Grey.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks! But I've definitely put on some weight. Grey, I haven't been out and about lately, seems like there are a lot of new faces around!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said with a smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="873.html">« Prev</a><a href="875.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
