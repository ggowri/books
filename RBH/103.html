She opened her mouth, wanting to say something more, but perhaps knowing that she was in the wrong, she didn't say anything and left sulkily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, bring the contract to our Purchasing Department tomorrow. The flower arrangement this time has received unanimous praise from the VIP group. Leave the professional matters to the professionals, I believe in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know whether Elliott was praising me this time or truly acknowledging Paige's team's flower arrangement skills, but he didn't hesitate and readily agreed to sign a contract with Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected this result at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I originally thought Giselle had it in the bag this time, but little did I know, she would make such a big mistake in the first major event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, it was really that even the heavens couldn't bear witness to my past life's misfortunes, so this life also unhesitatingly stood by my side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, no problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being able to achieve this cooperation is certainly a good start for Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was extremely happy, so she insisted on dragging me to Quinn's club to celebrate that evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige has now become a regular at the Quinn Club. When she is there, she feels more at ease than when she is at her own home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened a private room and took me to get high, and called Fiona and her group of friends who often eat and drink with her, organized a game, and called for the most expensive champagne to celebrate the success of her signing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paige so happy, I felt particularly gratified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at the time when we were having the most fun, Quinn appeared in our box with Philip and Alexis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn still had his trendy casual attire, and this time, he even wore a row of diamond earrings on his left ear. His hairstyle had also been groomed, making him look very hip and youthful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Philip arrived, he joined Paige and the two of them started playing dice games, with their shoulders touching and arms linked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a lawyer, Alexis seemed a bit aloof. However, two girls approached him and struck up a conversation, and he didn't resist. He started playing with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held a glass of wine and walked out to the terrace, intending to take a breath and have a look at the street view outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And not long after, Quinn also came out with a glass of wine in his hand. He stood beside me, looking at me with a smile on his face, and suddenly asked me a question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How was it? Was today's schedule wonderful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What arrangement is wonderful or not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't understand what he meant at first, and I looked at him in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn raised his glass and lightly tapped it against mine. Then, he took a sip of his drink and smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course it was the arrangement of Giselle's absence, do you think it was just a coincidence? Did you think it was divine intervention?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly opened my mouth in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea that Giselle was aware of this, and from the way he spoke, it seemed like he not only knew about it but also intentionally arranged it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my bewildered face, he then used his finger to scratch my nose. Afterward, he smiled and said, "..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Giselle intentionally skipped it? It was me who gave Rowan two concert tickets from Alexis and instructed Rowan to surprise Giselle. As a result, Rowan tricked Giselle into going out of town at the last minute, causing her to miss this important reception event by Bryant Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it turns out that all of this was actually Quinn's deliberate arrangement?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how would he know that I didn't want Giselle and Elliott to interact?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And how could he know so much about everything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I looked at Quinn as if he were an alien. I had countless questions in my mind about him, and I increasingly felt like he was a prophet, already knowing so much about things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why was he suddenly willing to be friends with me and go out of his way to help me time and time again?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="102.html">« Prev</a><a href="104.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
