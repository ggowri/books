Come downstairs, I'm waiting for you." Elliott's voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll be right there," I replied quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wrapped up my work and grabbed my bag before heading downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Toby was behind the wheel, and Elliott was waiting for me in the car. As soon as I got in, Elliott took my cold hands and started rubbing them to warm them up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's freezing out here. You should wear a coat next time," he said with concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My cold hands were quickly warmed by him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be fine. It's just a short walk," I reassured him. "What would possibly your parents and your grandfather want to tell us?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of that I needed to face them at the Bryant Villa annoyed me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know. We'll find out soon enough. It could be anything from a casual chat to discussing Christmas plans. My mother wants us to spend Christmas with my grandfather in Brila," Elliott explained gently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bryant family had roots in Brila, and they often visited relatives there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like a reasonable topic for discussion, but something about Laura's tone made me uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I decided to worry about it when I got there. At least, this time Elliott would be on my side to fight against his family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We switched the topic, talking about the Christmas plans and some other stuff casually.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I chatted for a while. Not long after, we arrived at the Bryant Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we approached the Bryant Villa, I felt a sense of apprehension creeping over me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere inside was tense, and there was none of the usual warmth that greeted us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Bryant Villa was soaked in a quiet and solemn gloom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cormac was sitting in his seat, wearing a serious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper and Laura were seated on the sofa. I could not tell their emotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The servants stood at attention, and the dining table was bare. Everyone stared at us in silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I greeted them simultaneously as we entered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, have a seat. We have something important to discuss," Jasper said, motioning for us to sit down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed to the two chairs that had been placed in the living room early for us to sit down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like we were about to face a firing squad...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart started to race as I took in the scene before me. But Elliott's reassuring squeeze on my hand gave me some comfort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me and gave me a reassuring look, then pulled out a chair for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just tell us what you want. I will take Madeline for dinner later," Elliott said, his tone tinged with impatience.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the intimidating atmosphere, Elliott's confidence didn't waver.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="362.html">« Prev</a><a href="364.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
