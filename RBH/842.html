It had to be Elliott standing out there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My unusual reaction must have piqued his curiosity. Always sharp, he must have sensed something was off, and that's why he followed me immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this current situation, the moment I open the door and Elliott sees both our families gathered for dinner, he's bound to become suspicious. Explaining it to him then would be a real challenge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, my folks are still in the dark about Elliott's condition, let alone the fact that I've been helping him through it. I've been using work and business trips as an excuse for not going home. If Elliott ever shows up in front of them, Austin would definitely blow a fuse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot Noah a quick glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Bryant family ever catches a glimpse of Noah, I could still fool Elliott with his amnesia. But Laura, she's fully aware of everything that's happened. She's always suspected that Noah might be Elliott's child. If she ever lays eyes on him, she won't let us off the hook easily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should I do? What should I do?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the urgent knock on the door, I instinctively shot Quinn a look of unease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that Elliott outside the door?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he suddenly understood something. He leaned in close to my ear, asking me in a voice only I could hear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a nod, casting him a glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instantly grasped my dilemma, swiftly scanning the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rooms at the Hoswich Hotel aren't completely enclosed. In fact, one side of the room opens up to a scenic walkway, allowing guests to take a break and enjoy the view while dining.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This corridor connects to every room, implying that the room door isn't the only way out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's said that this design is due to the unique structure of the Hoswich Hotel. Thus, this scenic corridor also serves as an emergency exit, providing a convenient escape route in case of any sudden incidents.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin, Lily, Madeline just ran into a tough customer. She'll probably need to have a private chat with him. How about this, I'll escort you guys out through the corridor and we'll wait for her downstairs," Quinn quickly suggested to my parents.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of pesky client? One that has us booted out into the hallway?" Austin, already tipsy, furrowed his brows in displeasure at Quinn's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I'll explain everything later. You guys go downstairs with Noah now," I quickly told Austin, urging them to hurry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Quinn had already exchanged a few hushed words with his parents. I didn't catch what he said, but it was clear that after he spoke, his folks promptly and cooperatively exited the hallway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reading my expression and the urgent knocking from outside, it seemed as though Lily understood something. So, she grabbed her basket, joined Austin, and followed Quinn down the hallway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after I saw them leave with my own eyes, did I take a deep breath and then opened the door to the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the room, Elliott was already pacing, a frown etched on his face. The moment he saw me open the door, he took a deep breath, his gaze then shifting into the room:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, didn't you say you were entertaining a client? Why are you alone in the room?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They headed down the corridor, said something about the view being nice, just taking a stroll," I responded nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott strolled in, a puzzled expression on his face. "How come I never heard you mention you were hosting a party here?" he asked.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="841.html">« Prev</a><a href="843.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
