Wasn't she one of the girls who gathered with Giselle at the bar that night?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the group, the other girls were quite noisy, but this girl had been quietly sitting in the corner playing with her phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason she left a deep impression on me was her outstanding appearance and demeanor, and I had greeted her when I went to the restroom at the bar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to be Jezebel from the poster.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did she suddenly come to Bryant Hospital?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that she came here to see Giselle?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That group of people from that night seemed to be Giselle's friends, and Jezebel suddenly became the lead actress of Allure. Could all of this be related to Giselle?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this way, I immediately called Adam.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, does Allure's lead actress Jezebel know Giselle?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam had a close relationship with Rowan and Giselle during college. He might know something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just speculation. What I didn't expect was Adam's surprised reaction when I asked about this. He then cryptically said, "Madeline, you know about it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam's words carried significant implications. I couldn't help but ask, "Know about what, Adam? Please explain."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam straightforwardly said to Madeline on the phone, "Madeline, Jezebel is Giselle's best friend, and they've known each other for years and come from the same place. Allure by the Bryant Group is said to be tailored for Jezebel. She is currently a contracted artist of the Bryant Group, recommended by Giselle to Mr. Bryant. I was worried telling you this would upset you, so I didn't dare mention it before."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart suddenly skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was just as I suspected. Jezebel was recommended by Giselle to Elliott. Now she was a signed artist with the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott never mentioned this to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said I didn't trust him and didn't tell him anything. But when did he ever tell me anything about the Bryant Group?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recommended by Giselle, he signed her, not just that, he also planned to fully support... His attitude towards Giselle was nothing like the disinterest he claimed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down my spine, and I felt even more I was too naive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost believed him, believed in a man's care and love. But Elliott had always been deep and meticulous in his thoughts. How could I know what he was really thinking deep down?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="384.html">« Prev</a><a href="386.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
