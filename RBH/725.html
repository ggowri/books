Seeing me transition from resisting him to gradually accepting him, he increased his strength and forcefully inserted all five fingers into the gaps between mine, tightly gripping my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to resist him, Elliott suddenly said softly, "I remember you were most afraid of thunderstorms. Luckily, today I happened to be on the same flight as </span><span>you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did remember this. I felt a slight jolt in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't speak. Just then, the plane finally landed smoothly and quickly taxied on the tarmac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could free myself, he had already let go of my hand, without any hesitation or hesitation, just like his usual style in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that he was no longer brainwashed by the newly appointed driver and emotional mentor by his side. He finally returned to his original cold and distant appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon it was time to disembark, and he didn't linger or bid me farewell any longer. He stood up and politely let me leave first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was walking toward the exit, he suddenly said to me from behind, "Be safe on this trip, and if anything happens, you can call me right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hesitated for a moment, and compared to his previous entanglement with me, I actually felt more comfortable with him keeping his distance from me now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I faintly responded, "Okay, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly walked out of the cabin and met up with a few of my colleagues and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the pre-arranged itinerary, we quickly boarded the bus arranged by the local guide Billy and headed straight to the hotel that had been booked in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the next three days, under Billy's guidance, we visited Vespera City, Zephyria City, and Edulet City. As the final destination, Billy arranged for us to go to Amber Snow Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was traveling in the late stage of pregnancy, and even though I was with a tour group, I still found it very challenging. We kept on playing for three consecutive days, and by the time we reached Amber Snow Mountain, I was already exhausted. I asked them to follow Billy for sightseeing, while I rested alone in the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finally managed to sleep soundly in the room for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, I wanted to sleep until they came back before leaving the room. However, while I was sleeping, the phone suddenly woke me up with its ringing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I groggily picked up the phone and realized that the incoming call was from an unfamiliar mobile number in Norch City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, a hoarse female voice could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, may I ask who you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She called my name directly, but I felt her voice particularly unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know Quinn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she confirmed that I was Madeline, her voice immediately turned cold and her tone sent a shiver down my spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew him. What's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked with doubt, and at the same time, some doubts inevitably arose in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, when I was about to board the plane, Quinn clearly said that he was worried about me and wanted to come after me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But during these days when I arrived in Norch City, he never contacted me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he was just saying that, or maybe he was delayed by something temporary, so I didn't ask him much either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I had made it clear to him. He had not contacted me, and if I were to ask him if he had come to see me, it would seem a bit contrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, this unfamiliar phone call came, and it made my heart involuntarily feel a little scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this Norch City's number? Does that mean Quinn has come to Norch City?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did something happen to him?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="724.html">« Prev</a><a href="726.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
