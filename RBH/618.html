Elliott couldn't be unaware of her motive, so he coldly said, "Giselle, you're being too extreme."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to his words, Giselle placed one leg outside the railing. Tears streaked down her face as she pitifully said, "Elliott, I have already given birth to our child. I </span><span>have given you my youth, and if you don't engage with me, my life will be meaningless. Have you not gotten over your ex-wife? Well, I will jump down, and then you two can be together. I hope you will treat my child well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Giselle made a gesture as if she was going to jump off the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, please. Please agree to Giselle quickly! I had a heart condition. What will I do if something happens to her? Elliott, don't leave her alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Elliott remained silent, Nicole began to cry. Nicole and Giselle worked together perfectly. They won the sympathy of the onlookers, and people started to condemn Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was so heartless. That woman had just given birth to his child. How could he not get engaged to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The woman's mother begged him, but he remained indifferent. He seemed to like someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This woman looked very young, and I heard that she had just graduated not long ago. If she died like this, the man would feel guilty for the rest of his life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. He should have agreed to her first and let her calm down. She just gave birth to a baby, and now it's so windy. She might get sick..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were discussing animatedly. Fiona and I stood in the crowd. Seeing this scene, I couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was very clever. She knew that once she and the child were sent abroad, she would have no chance to be with Elliott. So, she decided to achieve her goal using this method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that the child suffered from Down syndrome. As the child grew up, soon everyone would know about it. If she hadn't married Elliott by then, her plan would have failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she had to take a risk and pressure Elliott into getting engaged to her. And the sooner, the better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she wanted to get engaged, I helped her fulfill her wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The best way to punish someone was to first fill them with hope and then make them despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, I couldn't help but laugh. I devised a brilliant plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quietly pulled Fiona aside and asked her in a low voice, "Fiona, can you help me figure out a way to get the child's photos and videos?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's simple. I will ask my colleagues in the neonatal department to help take some photos and videos. What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It would be great if you could manage to get them. Also, just in case, could you help me with a paternity test for that child and Elliott?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure. One of my friends works at a paternity testing agency. As long as we get their hair, we can do a paternity test. Are you suspecting that the child is not Elliott's?" Fiona suddenly understood my intention and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, I didn't have such doubts. Because ever since Giselle got pregnant, everything was done with the approval of the Bryant family, and Giselle couldn't possibly play tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just now someone in the crowd mentioned that the child and Elliott didn't look alike at all, which reminded me...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="617.html">« Prev</a><a href="619.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
