After you finish the infusion, I will take you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the lunch box again, and the aroma of the sandwich wafted over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After tossing and turning all night, plus the fact that I hadn't eaten much at the dinner party just now, at this very moment, I smelled this fragrance, and my stomach couldn't help but make a rumbling sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ward was very quiet, but this sudden sound unexpectedly made Elliott laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rarely smiled in general, most of the time his expression was as cold as ice. But in fact, he looked very good when he smiled, as if he had become much younger and full of vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fell in love with him back then because I saw a poster of him on campus. In the poster, he was wearing a sports uniform, with a bright smile on his face, holding a trophy in his hands. His smile was like a breath of fresh air, exceptionally bright, and carried the youthful and spirited look that only young people possess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the smile on his face was exactly the same as the one on that poster... For a moment, I was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eat, you were already hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up the sandwich again and handed it to me. There was a rare tenderness in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will do it myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was not used to his gentleness, so I took the sandwich from his hand and started eating it myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Quinn, Fiona, and Paige returned to the ward, I had already finished eating a whole sandwich. My stomach felt warm and my mood instantly improved a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them saw that we didn't frown, so they knew that we didn't have a quarrel. Therefore, they also breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This medicine had a good detoxifying effect. After she finished this bottle of infusion, there should be no major problems. Elliott, be more careful in the future and don't leave Madeline alone halfway again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona came over to take a look and helped me remove the needle from my hand, not forgetting to scold Elliott a few more times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, where did you go at night? We will take you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige knew that I was currently living at my parents' house, which is why she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I took her home in the evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, was the first to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fine, I'll give you a chance to make up for your mistake. However, Elliott, this time you owe me a big favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn patted Elliott's shoulder and then gestured for Paige to join him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, do you want to go with him, or shall we take you back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paige still wasn't reassured, and she asked me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I went with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I blurted out almost simultaneously. However, I didn't want to go back with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's respect Madeline's own decision. Elliott, you go back first, we'll see Madeline off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige saw that I didn't want to go home with Elliott, so she grabbed my hand and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! How could Madeline forgive you so quickly? Can a sandwich make her forgive you? Madeline is not that easy to soften."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona immediately chimed in as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I increasingly feel that having these two best friends is great, saving me from having to talk too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you're right. We can't just let him get away with doing such a messed up thing. How about this, I suggest we have Elliott treat us to a meal another day and sincerely apologize to Madeline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn added fuel and vinegar to his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, who were you friends with after all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was at a loss for words when he was first surrounded by the crowd. He glared at Quinn fiercely and then stood up abruptly, with a stern expression on his face, and walked out of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, the siege from the crowd made Elliott, who had always been proud, very embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought this jerk would change for the better, but looking at his sour face, it's highly unlikely that he would change at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott just left like that, Fiona couldn't help but roll her eyes and said indignantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give him some time. Haven't you noticed that he has already changed towards Madeline?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="36.html">« Prev</a><a href="38.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
