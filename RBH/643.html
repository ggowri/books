She fell to the ground and cried while looking at him. Giselle opened her mouth, as if she wanted to say something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the face of reality, no matter how hard she denies it, it is futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Giselle's dejected appearance, I didn't sympathize with her at all. On the contrary, I felt an immense sense of satisfaction in seeking revenge deep within me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Giselle deliberately making things difficult for me, insisting on bringing up the issue of her child in my marriage with Elliott, everything she had tonight would have belonged to me and the child in my belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, there was no way back. Elliott and I would never start again, and I no longer loved him. Everything had changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the days that followed, I could only live with my child, strong and self-reliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to let my beloved child lose their father, but this was already my choice. Once the original intention is deviated from, it becomes difficult for me to find it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of this, I looked at Giselle, and my emotions became even more complicated, and I hated her even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, I was mercilessly tormented by her, gradually losing my reputation and causing my family to be destroyed. Looking back now, I still have a deep impression of these scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, I already knew what would happen and had a chance to change the ending. But I didn't expect that my happiness would still be ended by Giselle... However, in this life, I couldn't reconcile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle harmed me, I wouldn't let her happy either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was fair... Bad people should indeed receive the retribution they deserve, that is what makes the lives of good people worth living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled slightly, lowered the brim of my hat, and quickly left the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ken finished this task, he quietly left the computer room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had just gotten into the car when I received a call from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, have you come out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yup, I'm in the car. And you, where are you now?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am on my way home. So, how do you feel? Are you happy?" Ken asked me excitedly on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, thank you. However, the Bryant family will definitely investigate this matter. Have you taken care of everything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got everything covered. Don't worry. I deleted all the surveillance footage that captured both of us. I even manipulated the system to make it look like a hacker intrusion, and I didn't leave any fingerprints at the scene. They won't be able to find anything in their investigation," Ken said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, thank you! Good night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Ken's words, I immediately stopped worrying and hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat in the car for a while instead of driving away immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, I just felt that being too excited was not good for prenatal education, so I wanted to calm down for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But little did I know, right at that moment, I saw Elliott walking out of the hotel's main entrance. He held his phone in his hand, as if making a call to someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was wondering what he was going to do when, the next second, my phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The series of familiar numbers on the screen shocked me suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he find me?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="642.html">« Prev</a><a href="644.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
