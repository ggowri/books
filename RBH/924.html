I'll be outside having a smoke. Call me when you're done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soaking in the water, I heard his gentle reminder followed by his footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finally mustered the courage to emerge, just in time to see his tall figure in a white bathrobe walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was hormones or the sweetness of the night, just a glimpse of his back made my heart flutter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathroom finally became quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My racing heart gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I squeezed some body wash and carefully scrubbed myself.

I was overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How should I handle this? I realized that rationality was useless at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I kept telling myself to stay away from Elliott, my body wouldn't listen. I was completely at his mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't dare open my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To avoid the awkwardness of eye contact, I pretended to sleep, letting him handle me like a pliable dough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dried me from head to toe with a towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every part of me, including the scar from my C-section and my birthmarks, was exposed to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt his hand pause and tremble slightly when it touched the scar on my belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he gently kissed my forehead:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry for all you've been through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew how much guilt was contained in his apology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shivered, my nose tingling, almost on the verge of tears.

His touch had awakened a long-dormant desire within me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like every cell in my body was waiting for his touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speechless with myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed slowly, each second feeling like an eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My cold body gradually warmed under the blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart, initially chaotic, slowly returned to calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought Elliott wouldn't be able to resist and would pounce on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to my surprise, he didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He acted like a perfect gentleman, not touching me or even pulling back the covers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence around us was eerie, making me almost think he had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively opened my eyes, only to find him propping his head up with his hand, gazing at me tenderly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the window, a crescent moon hung quietly in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The curtains were open, and the moonlight filtered in, making the atmosphere even more serene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he was watching me made my face flush instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I won't touch you without your permission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott noticed my surprise and spoke softly, his eyes calm and his tone steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe how restrained he was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you really hold back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, I had seen how wild and eager he could be in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, even with the tension in the air, he controlled himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that my post-pregnancy body and the scar on my stomach turned him off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made me feel a bit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I silently complained to myself, he chuckled and pinched my cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You want me to lose control?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," I hurriedly defended myself, unsure of what else to say. "You weren't like this before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I regretted my bluntness as soon as the words left my mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes crinkled with laughter as he moved closer, his features becoming more distinct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was in a hurry, but seeing the scar from your C-section and thinking about all you went through alone, I couldn't bear it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was gentle, filled with deep compassion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected to hear such words from Elliott in my lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The empathy and understanding in his words made my eyes well up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting him to see my tears, I turned away and choked out,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Having Noah was my choice.

I never expected you to have such a cute baby for me. Seeing the scar on your stomach, I realized how much I owe you and that I need to make it up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me tenderly, his hoarse voice filled with guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at him, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a time when I was determined to be a single mother and raise Noah on my own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought I could do it alone, with my parents' help, without needing to tell Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, hearing his words and seeing his expression, I felt the magic of our shared bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man and I had a child together. Our child had both our features and carried our shared blood, a continuation of our lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling of a shared bloodline could only be understood by parents. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by raising a child together could a man feel such deep, heartfelt guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really mean that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I bit my lip, unable to hold back my tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been strong all this time, facing every storm alone.
