I came here today to apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> stood before my parents, soaked and looking quite </span><span>messy</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he stood </span><span>straight as if he had all the</span><span> courage and responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't call us </span><span>like that</span><span>. We can't </span><span>take</span><span> it. </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, Madeline </span><span>starts</span><span> a new life now. You </span><span>need to stop</span><span> </span><span>harass</span><span>ing</span><span> her or us anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom sat on the sofa, still stern, but I noticed her eyes lingering on the hem of </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s wet clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had stood in the rain for too long; water kept dripping from his clothes. My mom, always soft-hearted, must have felt uneasy seeing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't show it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know my family and I have </span><span>hurt</span><span> Madeline</span><span> badly</span><span> in the past, causing much pain</span><span> to her and you</span><span>. I've talked to my dad, and he agrees that our family should make </span><span>it up</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you're willing, we can formally propose again and meet all your demands. We are even willing to hold another wedding. This is our sincere offer to Madeline and to you. I hope you </span><span>can give me another chance, for the sake of our past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span>'s voice was sincere and firm, carrying a deep, magnetic tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Water still dripped from him, and his face grew paler, but he stood unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad's eyelid twitched, and he </span><span>automatically </span><span>glanced at my mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom was </span><span>also</span><span> surprised by </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s sincerity. For a moment, they exchanged looks, both showing a brief hesitation in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was only for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad spoke in a deep voice:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Let bygones be bygones</span><span>, and our daughter </span><span>would live a good life without</span><span> the Bryant family. You speak nicely now, but what if Madeline goes back and ends up in </span><span>the same nightmare</span><span> again? How could we bear that? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span>, with your </span><span>background</span><span>, there must be many women eager to marry you and have your children. You don't need to </span><span>stick</span><span> to our Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we won't let Madeline repeat her mistakes. Give up on this idea. Your act won't work on us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom immediately added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, go take a hot shower and change your clothes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The servant had already brought a new tracksuit of my dad's as I </span><span>told</span><span>. I took </span><span>the clothes</span><span> to </span><span>Elliott</span><span> and said to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> still wanted to insist, but I was afraid he would catch a cold, so I dragged him into the bathroom, handed him the clothes, and closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, make him some ginger tea to warm up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said to my mom after coming out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom glared at me fiercely:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make ginger tea? I think you're getting </span><span>moved</span><span> again. Madeline, this is a sugar-coated bullet. Don't fall for it easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her tough words, my mom still went to the kitchen reluctantly, took ginger from the fridge, and started making the tea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked to the living room, sat quietly next to my dad, and held his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad patted the back of my hand and looked at me gently:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, tell me, what are you thinking now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I don't know. I'm </span><span>lost</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said honestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Your mom and I think</span><span> Quinn is definitely more suitable for you. His family is kind and polite, and Quinn is devoted to you and treats Noah as his own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, my dad, like my mom, already saw </span><span>Quinn </span><span>as their future son-in-law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad's words made my heart even more </span><span>at a loss</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew </span><span>Quinn </span><span>deserved all the good things in the world. In terms of appearance, family background, and character, he was not inferior to </span><span>Elliott</span><span> in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But from the beginning, my feelings for him were always more than friendship but less than love. I knew he was very, very good, but I found it hard to fall in love with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything he did moved me deeply, but there was always something missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart was easily affected by what </span><span>Elliott</span><span> said and done. B</span><span>ut with Quinn, I always remained rational and found it hard to be impulsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my silence, my dad continued:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if you insist on </span><span>getting back</span><span> </span><span>together </span><span>with </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, I have nothing to say. After all, he is Noah's father. </span><span>You two being together</span><span> would be better for Noah's future. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We love Noah very much and are willing to do anything for him, but there's no guarantee that when he grows up and learns about his background, he won't feel a sense of loss. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It&rsquo;s best to raise a</span><span> child in a </span><span>healthy</span><span> family, but only if </span><span>Elliott</span><span> can ensure he won't hurt you or </span><span>Noah again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad spoke calmly, his perspective far more rational and long-term than my mom's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, let me think about it. This can't be rushed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, </span><span>Elliott</span><span> had finished changing and came out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lost a lot of weight. He used to look much bigger than my dad, but now, except for the slightly short sleeves, my dad's tracksuit fit him quite well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dried his hair</span><span>. T</span><span>he black </span><span>hair</span><span> </span><span>fell</span><span> messily across his forehead. Compared to his usual meticulous hairstyle, this look made him appear much younger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom came out with a bowl of ginger soup, her tone still cold:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott</span><span>, come over and drink this ginger soup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, </span><span>Lily</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> walked over and took the ginger soup from my mom's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he never liked ginger, this time he drank the</span><span>m all </span><span>without even a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy rain outside had stopped by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The servants brought in the gifts he had brought, </span><span>putting</span><span> them by the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, the high-end packaging of the gifts kept them from getting soaked, so everything </span><span>inside </span><span>was still in perfect condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Mom, I brought some premium </span><span>health tonics</span><span> for </span><span>you</span><span>. Also, a Rolex watch for Dad, a Herm&egrave;s bag for Mom, and the latest LV bag for Madeline. Oh, and I got some educational toys and a few outfits for the baby..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> pointed to the pile of gifts and spoke to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was casual, but the gifts he mentioned were worth tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pile of gifts easily cost a few million, showing his extraordinary sincerity this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad and mom stood up in surprise at the sight of such expensive gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad quickly said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't accept </span><span>these</span><span>. You should take them back to your parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are nothing. I just want you to know that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to win Madeline back. Just say the word, and I'll make it happen. Dad, I can't live without Madeline..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> looked at my dad, his sudden heartfelt confession leaving the old man stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="909.html">« Prev</a><a href="911.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
