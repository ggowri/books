We jumped out of the car and appeared in front of her, blocking her way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you headed with that suitcase so late at night?" I asked her coldly, arms crossed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She probably didn't expect me to show up so quickly. Seeing me and Quinn, she was visibly startled, her eyes full of alertness. "What are you two doing here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For what happened at my place tonight, shouldn't you be explaining yourself?" I looked at her, coldly demanding answers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at me, then at Quinn who was with me. Then, perhaps realizing that slipping away wasn't likely, she pointed towards her mansion. "Well, then let's talk at my place."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine." Quinn and I exchanged a look and followed Jade into her mansion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My impression of Jade had always been from the time when she came to study at Hoswich, living with us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Jade was plain and ordinary, very obedient and sensible. She always went out of her way to please me, trying to keep me happy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as I stepped into her lavishly decorated Italian-style mansion, it dawned on me that she had quietly risen above her station with the help of my family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The luxurious decoration and the custom-made high-end Italian furniture in her mansion, every detail oozed wealth. Yet, she was just a maid at my place. No matter how handsome her salary might be, it couldn't support this kind of spending.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of my parents still living in our old villa while Jade had secretly achieved social ascent fueled the flames of anger inside me...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for my experiences from the past life, I would have been caught off guard again, and this bloodsucker might have drained even more from my family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that things have come to this, let's be honest. In the spirit of family, I promise that if you return the ill-gotten gains you've taken from Glory Group these past few years, I won't pursue your responsibility any further," I said to Jade coldly, suppressing my inner fury.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't taken any dirty money. All the money I've earned is through my own hard work. If it weren't for me helping Austin with various business matters these past few years, Glory Group wouldn't be what it is today." Unexpectedly, even when disaster was imminent, Jade remained defiant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got all the evidence of your illicit gains from Glory Group, including the evidence of tonight's hitmen breaking into my house. Do you think you can escape legal consequences by refusing to admit it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, since you have the evidence, why bother arguing with her? Just hand her over to the police!" The sound of police sirens outside interrupted Quinn, prompting him to say directly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade probably didn't expect us to call the police. In that moment, her face paled, and she instinctively turned to flee.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this point, the police had stormed into the mansion, and before our eyes, they handcuffed Jade with chilling finality...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, she probably realized that all her plans had failed, and her hoped-for good days were over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at me, tears rolling down her face, screaming all the while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, when did you start suspecting me? You idiot, weren't you just about eating, drinking, and having fun in the past? How did you suddenly become so smart? Just you wait, even if you send me to prison, when I come out, I won't spare you..." She screamed desperately as the police pulled her into the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched the police car drive away coldly, and suddenly, Quinn draped his coat over my shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put his hand on my shoulder and whispered softly, "Do you feel a sense of revenge fulfilled? Have you just realized how simple it is to deal with someone?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="322.html">« Prev</a><a href="324.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
