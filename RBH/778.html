He stood by the window, tall and lean, silhouetted against the light.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned at the sound, the light casting uneven shadows across his face. His handsome features were indistinct in the glow, and I noticed, not only had he changed his clothes, but he had also shaved his beard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, he was still that same image-obsessed character.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me and Jack, a gentle smile gradually surfaced on his face as he walked towards us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, where have you gone?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just went to see Dr. Jones. How come you're up and even changed your clothes?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ducked my head, avoiding his intense gaze, and asked in a nonchalant tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in good health and I want to go home. Madeline, I'm craving your cooking."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing full well that I was deliberately avoiding his gaze, he purposefully hooked my chin up, his eyes brimming with affection as he looked at me. He didn't shy away in the slightest, even with Jack and Barry standing right there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon witnessing this scene, Jack coughed awkwardly as a cover-up, quickly saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, you've just come around. We need to run some tests before we can decide if you're ready for discharge."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Elliott felt a twinge of annoyance:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need a check-up, I know my own body. I'm fine, I'll check out now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone still carried that same old air of arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he truly oblivious to the fact that he had a brush with death, barely snatched from the jaws of the Grim Reaper?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or, should he pretend to have amnesia?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, I lifted my gaze to take a good, hard look at him. However, his facade was as normal as ever, giving away absolutely nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Mr. Bryant, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack wanted to continue his persuasion, but to his surprise, Elliott impatiently waved him off:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing to it, I'll get myself discharged right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Mr. Bryant insists on being discharged, then let's proceed with it. Didn't you mention a few days ago during the check-up that he's essentially recovered?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry chimed in at just the right moment, shooting Jack a knowing glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding, Jack didn't persist any further. He quickly nodded in agreement:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll get started on the discharge process. Ms. Mayers, could you please come over and assist me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's my wife! Dr. Jones, who gave you the right to call her Ms. Mayers?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Jack's words had ticked Elliott off. Elliott shot him a murderous glance, causing Jack, who was on the verge of retirement, to shrink his neck in surprise:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Mr. Bryant, my bad. I'll be more careful."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, stop giving Jack a hard time. I'll be back in a jiffy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked out of the hospital room with Jack.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jack, you saw what just happened. Are you sure he's lost his memory?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked straight away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can pretty much confirm."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there any treatment available at the moment?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack halted, his expression serious as he looked at me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The clot in his brain is in a particularly delicate location. Only a top-tier international surgeon would dare to risk an open skull procedure to remove it. For now, we can only adopt a conservative treatment approach, trying our best to keep him from any form of agitation, and see if the clot will dissipate over time."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="777.html">« Prev</a><a href="779.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
