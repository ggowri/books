Elliott and I shared a knowing high-five, ready to embark on our next adventure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather was truly splendid, with the sun shining brightly and a gentle breeze blowing. As Elliott and I sat in the car, heading towards our next stop, he couldn't help but take my hand, giving me a tender smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never realized before, all the things we could do together. I feel like we've wasted all those past years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gazed into the distance, unable to resist expressing his sentiments.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've loved him for so many years, been married to him for just as long. Yet, all this time, we've been like two parallel lines that never intersect. I don't understand his world, and he doesn't understand mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once time has passed, it never comes back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I murmured softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No worries, we've got plenty of time to make up for it. Let's not think about that today. Come on, I'll take you to challenge them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott exclaimed with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We quickly caught up with the main group, and at Elliott's request, everyone began to regroup for the competition.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our teamwork had gradually become seamless, we kept succeeding. By the time we reached the final hole, he and I were already far ahead of everyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone finished playing ball, it was already high noon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sun grew increasingly intense, so we hopped back into the cart and returned to the golf clubhouse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was thrilled with Elliott's arrival. After all, the Bryant Group's power in Hoswich City remained unshakeable. Plus, for many years, the Bryant Group had consistently held the presidency of the Hoswich City Chamber of Commerce, a position of considerable prestige.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We won the match, and Elliott was over the moon. He immediately declared he was picking up the tab for everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was in high spirits, and soon, they began toasting each other, instantly creating an exceptionally harmonious atmosphere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't touch a drop of alcohol. After nibbling on some food, I found myself alone on the terrace, taking a moment for myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey emerged, a pastry in hand. Seeing me alone on the terrace, he approached, his gaze heavy with unspoken thoughts:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, level with me, do you still have feelings for Elliott?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't sure how to respond to Grey, instinctively avoiding her gaze:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At first, there was nothing, I never considered getting back together with him. However, I admit, lately, my emotions have been somewhat turbulent."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard you've had feelings for him for years, and now you two are so sweet together, it's inevitable that emotions would develop. Plus, I've never seen Elliott so invested in a woman before, it's clear he has feelings for you too. You need to think this through. Don't get back with him just to help him heal, it wouldn't be fair to you, to Quinn, or to him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey said calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, my emotions a tangled mess.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, if I continue this sweet charade with Elliott, playing the role of his wife, I fear I might just fall for him all over again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his illness...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, I found myself stuck in a real pickle. Grey gave my shoulder a firm pat, reminding me to think twice.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="888.html">« Prev</a><a href="890.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
