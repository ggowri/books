He looked at me with a faint smile and looked vicious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you tired now? You'll be even more tired later."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm ignoring you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My face suddenly turned red from his amusement. I didn't dare to look into his eyes and turned my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I couldn't understand why some women could act coquettishly in front of men. Only after experiencing it did I know that when a man loved you and cared for you, you would unconsciously show the most feminine side of women.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and reached out to pinch my nose, hugging me tightly from behind. The warmth of his breath lingered in my ears. "If you're tired, you should sleep, and I'll prepare something delicious for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? You know how to cook?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him in surprise. In my impression, Elliott never cooked, and his cooking skills were average.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait and see."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, he kissed me gently on the lips and then stood up directly. He quickly put on his loungewear and then stretched greatly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was only for a moment, I could still see his entire toned figure. His figure was so perfect that made me feel inexplicably hot all over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The curtains were still open. I subconsciously glanced at the sunroom outside. When I saw the vague figure mark on the glass, I couldn't bear to look directly at it, and I blushed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But fortunately, Elliott didn't notice my expression. After he stretched, he leaned over to kiss my cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said to me, "You can sleep a little longer. I'll call you when I'm ready."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Elliott, who was dominating, could be so considerate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Presumably, in the previous life, he had treated Giselle like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I thought about it, many scenes from my previous life appeared in my mind unconsciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remember in my last life when I learned that he gave Giselle an apartment as a gift, I went to that apartment in person to find him. When the elevator door opened, I happened to see him and Giselle kissing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The passion in that scene was so similar to ours last night...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that God took pity on my miserable life in my last life, so he made up for everything in this life?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that what happened to me and Elliott now was a reply to his last life with Giselle?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that was the case, I couldn't accept the fact that Elliott and Giselle would be together again in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of him having sex with another woman like this, made me long for him even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, in this life, I didn't let her win Elliott's heart first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay leisurely on the bed and opened Facebook, I found Quinn had sent me a message last night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Madeline, I chatted with Elliott honestly for a long time. He said frankly that he likes you. I think that since he likes you now, you can try to stay with him and fulfill your dream. Don't worry, I will always help you.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's message made me want to cry for no reason. Sometimes I even thought that I had never done anything for Quinn, but why had he been so firm in guarding me in this life?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could I have a friend who treats me so sincerely?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very grateful and replied to him: [Thank you, Quinn. Other than that, I don't know what else I can do for you to express my gratitude.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he got up so early. He quickly sent me a smile emoji, and then replied to me: [You don't have to do anything for me. I just hope you will be happier.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With what he said, I was even more confident with Elliott's attitude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Elliott had real feelings for me now.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="288.html">« Prev</a><a href="290.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
