It was obviously not going to work on Elliott. He raised his eyebrows and continued, "Mr. Brown from the Tigress Pharmacy Company will be here in a few minutes, you sure you want to leave right now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was right. I didn't need to delay my next plans for Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Elliott made me angry by saying that, I held my temper down forcibly and turned my head angrily to sit across from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me with a smirk. He knew that I was just having a tantrum, so he turned to his desk and started typing seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Barry knocked on the door and reported to Elliott, "Mr. Bryant, Mr. Brown and the others have already arrived, and they are now waiting in the parlour."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, we'll be there right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott immediately stood up and lifted his chin at me, giving me a sign to come with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly packed up my clothes and followed Elliott to the parlour.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never been involved in business before, so I didn't know much about the famous companies at home, and I didn't have the slightest idea who they actually were.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when I walked into the parlour with Elliott and saw him face to face, I was stunned. I couldn't help but exclaim, "Marcus, oh dear, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was talking to his subordinate about something with his head turned to the side. He was wearing a black suit, with a medium build, and looked very strong. He couldn't be described as handsome, but his eyes were piercing, making him look impressive in bearing, either rich or powerful. Moreover, there was a sense of sophistication and maturity in him that had been honed during the conquest of the battlefield.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing my exclamation of surprise, Marcus raised his head in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Marcus frowned, probably not expecting someone to call him by his first name on such an occasion. However, in an instant, the moment he saw that it was me, he froze, and then his face was full of surprise. He was so excited that he stood up at once and said, "Madeline, what are you doing here? It's really been a long time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was really Marcus Brown!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was both astonished and delighted. At that moment, I passed right over Elliott and walked quickly to Marcus' side and patted him heavily on his arm. His arms were as strong as iron. I said, "It's really you! Are you really the boss of the Tigress Pharmacy Company? Didn't you go enlist and swear to be in the military for the rest of your life?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and I started making small talk. Meanwhile, I reminisced about the past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was my desk mate in high school and the only male friend I had during my school days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Marcus enlisted in the army, and I accompanied him to the station in person. I still could remember the way he saluted me in his formal military uniform.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Marcus was so eager for a military career, swearing he would make a name for himself and become an elite soldier in the army, and I deeply blessed him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been separated for almost ten years, I didn't expect Marcus, a man who had disappeared from my world, to show up in such a way.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="354.html">« Prev</a><a href="356.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
