You haven't left already, have you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's cheerful voice sounded through the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep the festivities going. We've got some matters to attend to."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's response was unabashed over the phone, his eyes gleaming with desire, hinting at an unfulfilled need.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His insinuations instantly brought a blush to my cheeks, and I found myself melting into him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige and Philip seem to be on the verge of a brawl. Are you sure you don't want to come back?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's relaxed voice sounded once more, and we could tell he was in a noisy environment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had just mentioned being on route to catch them in the act. Given Philip's temperament and Paige's fiery nature, a showdown was inevitable tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concerned that Paige might act impulsively, I signaled Elliott with a glance to go check on them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott grasped my meaning in an instant, his large hand squeezing my waist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we're on our way."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott hung up, and with his arm around me, we made our way back to the party venue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corridor, dimly lit, seemed unlikely to be frequented. However, as we turned, a sudden flash caught our attention.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a figure swiftly disappeared around the corner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott called out, releasing me and striding quickly toward the spot where the figure vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurried to follow. Yet, the hallway remained quiet and deserted, devoid of any presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought I saw a flash just now. Could someone be secretly taking pictures of us?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked anxiously, still trembling from the encounter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight's party had drawn attendees from diverse backgrounds. Our earlier conspicuous presence and Elliott's melodic voice must have piqued someone's curiosity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not a big deal."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing no sign of anyone else in the corridor, Elliott abandoned the pursuit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really not bothered?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him incredulously. After all, he had vehemently opposed any exposure of our relationship in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not, we're now legally married."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no reservations, Elliott wrapped his arm around me, heading confidently for the entrance to the party venue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, neither of us wore masks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as though he was prepared to announce to the world that I was his wife, filling my heart with warmth once more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we reentered the venue, it was already chaotic beyond words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was gathered around, and even from a distance, I could hear Paige's heart-rending cries amidst the commotion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, hearing my friend in such distress left me breathless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rushing into the crowd, I found Paige standing with her hands on her hips, tearfully berating Philip, "Philip, you jerk! How could you do this? Did you deliberately ignore the report I sent you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="278.html">« Prev</a><a href="280.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
