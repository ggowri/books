Madeline is not well, stop teasing her," Paige chided him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn asked, "What's the deal? I heard you were vomiting blood and had to be rescued. Is it that serious? If you want to be a successful career woman, you need to learn how to handle stress."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words were blunt but effective, as always.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sauntered over, casually pulling up a chair and sitting down, his mischievous smile still playing on his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grin and mischievous demeanor always managed to lift my spirits, and I found myself smiling in return.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't hold back and smiled lightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still able to crack a smile. I guess it's not as dire as I imagined. When Fiona called me and told me what happened, she made it sound like I'd never see you again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn </span><span>said</span><span>, reaching over to playfully tweak my nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always spolied me like that, which caught me off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both he and Paige had rushed back overnight upon hearing the news of my condition, which touched me deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the warmth of their concern, my tense and despondent mood began to lighten.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough of that. Madeline is all fine now. I have no idea what Elliott did to trigger it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's words lighten up Fiona's mood. Then she continued.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had a feeling it was him. No one else could get under her skin like that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's expression softened momentarily as he looked at me, his worry </span><span>obvious</span><span> in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he realized I was watching him, he adopted his usual cynical demeanor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two, go on now. You won't get anything out of her with both of you here. I'll handle this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn sat down casually as he </span><span>ordered </span><span>Paige and Fiona, being confident about how he knew about me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure about that? We've been Madeline's closest friends since childhood," Paige protested.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Quinn, don't flatter yourself" Fiona added, equally disgruntled with his dismissive attitude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn just raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes I can do more things than you ladies. Off you go. And while you're at it, grab something for Madeline and me to eat. I haven't had a meal since last night, and I'm starving."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn insisted and then waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and Fiona exchanged resigned glances before leaving the ward under the pretext of going shopping.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a look at Quinn, </span><span>who wore </span><span>a black leather coat with a V-neck undershirt, smoky gray trousers, and short Martin boots.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the winter chill, his clothes seemed extraordinarily thin, accentuating his ruggedly handsome features.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wondered where he had been all this time, only catching glimpses of his travels through Instagram posts from places like Juccester and Iwrinas.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wandering lifestyle mirrored his usual aloof and unconventional manners.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't look at me, I know I'm handsome."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quipped, catching me eyeing him. With a wink, he produced a lucky charm from his shoulder bag and handed it to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bring it for you from Juccester. Wear it on your wrist and give it a touch whenever you feel anxious. It'll help," he explained with a reassuring smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="369.html">« Prev</a><a href="371.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
