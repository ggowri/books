"There shouldn't be any problem. Fiona, please take a look at the report."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I finished speaking, I handed the ultrasound report to Fiona. Fiona took the report, glanced at it, and immediately smiled, "Your baby is developing very well. Everything is normal. There was some intrauterine bleeding before, but now it's gone. The fetal heart rate and embryo are all within normal ranges, so there's no major issue, Madeline, just take care of yourself, and come back for the NT scan at three months!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's words instantly relieved everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was so excited that he lifted me up right then and there, spinning me around before putting me down. "That's great! Madeline!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was genuinely happy for me from the bottom of his heart, his joy evident in his expression, as if the baby in my belly was truly his own, which moved me deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put Madeline down! Be careful in the first three months. Don't do this to her anymore!" Jessica anxiously shouted, worried that Quinn might accidentally hurt me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn chuckled and gently put me down, then turned to Fiona. "Fiona, see what prenatal vitamins she needs to ensure the baby's development. Prescribe them all, the best ones!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Quinn's words, Fiona couldn't help but give me a deep look. She must have known the truth and was deeply moved by Quinn's care for me. She smiled and said, "I've already prescribed everything she needs. Just take them on time. Don't worry about over-supplementing. It's not good for the baby if she becomes too big. Right now, what she needs most is to relax her mind, and everything else comes second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes, don't worry. With me around, I won't let her have a bad mood," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn kept nodding, as if he was taking Fiona's words as a decree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the baby is fine, we'll all be relieved. Madeline, why don't you come and stay at our place? It'll be convenient for me to take care of you," Jessica suggested immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I heard this, I was so nervous that the corners of my mouth twitched. I quickly waved my hand. "Jessica, there's no need for that. It's more convenient for me to stay at my own place, and my mom can take care of me. Don't worry about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Quinn understood my concerns. He immediately said, "We're not engaged or anything. Which girl just moves into the guy's house so casually? Besides, Lily is an excellent cook, and you can't even compare. It's better for her to stay at her own place. You don't need to consider this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn really got into character quickly, even directly addressing my mother by her name, which startled me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica was so annoyed that she gave him a hard pat on the shoulder. "You rascal, is your mom really as bad as you say? But you reminded me. Now that Madeline is pregnant, we need to pick a day for both sets of parents to meet and set a date. We can't treat Madeline unfairly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could hardly believe what I heard. Quinn and I hadn't even started dating, so how did we suddenly jump to engagement and marriage?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="541.html">« Prev</a><a href="543.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
