But can you actually cook?" I couldn't help but express my doubts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Elliott and I had been together for so long, and I hadn't even seen him step foot in the kitchen, let alone cook.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the eggs from my hands and said, "I'll give it a try. Omelets should be easy to make, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I replied, "Sure, you can give it a try. First, crack the eggs and whisk them with milk and cheese. After that, stir-fry the ingredients I've prepared, and pour the egg mixture in to fry it up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Elliott, making an omelet should be simple enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving him these quick instructions, I left the kitchen to go put the fresh flowers we bought on the way back into a vase in the living room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, my phone pinged. I pulled it out and found several unread messages.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, these messages were sent by Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The message reads: [Madeline, are you in Louis City?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Madeline, did Elliott go to see you? I need to talk to him urgently, but he said he can't come back for now.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Madeline, where are you guys in Louis City? Can I come to see you?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Madeline, if you see this message, please reply to me. I really need to talk to Elliott about something important.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Madeline, are you intentionally not replying to me?]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had sent five messages in a row, each asking whether Elliott was with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I checked the timestamps on the messages and noted that she sent a message roughly every five minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The latest message from Giselle was sent just two minutes ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way she warmly addressed me was as if she genuinely considered me her close friend. Yet she so boldly kept asking about my husband's whereabouts. Under the guise of needing him for something urgent, Giselle didn't try to hide her concern for Elliott at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought smugly, "It seems my photo must be torturing her, huh? After all, Elliott is with me right now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at the displeasing lines of text, I recalled all that had happened between Giselle and Elliott in their past life. Then, I walked into the kitchen, took another photo of him cooking, and directly sent it to Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pondered firmly, "She often used these tactics to subtly provoke me and assert her dominance in the past life. This time, I'll let her experience the same feeling!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sent the photo along with a message to Giselle: [My darling is cooking for me right now, so he might not be able to reply at the moment. If you need something, I can pass the message for you.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, after I sent the photo and message, it took a while before Giselle replied with a few words: [I got it. Sorry for bothering you.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From her words, I could sense the rich feeling of disappointment in her tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I imagined Giselle's dejected expression, I felt a strange sense of satisfaction. Just then, Elliott suddenly let out a cry from the kitchen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?" I asked as I hurried over to see what was going on. But as soon as I stepped into the kitchen, I smelled something burning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, dressed in a black sweater, was frantically trying to turn off the stove. I peeked and saw that the eggs in the pan were completely burnt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but chuckle, "You shouldn't fry eggs on high heat. They'll burn easily. Let me do it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked over and instinctively reached for the spatula in Elliott's hand, but his competitive nature made him block me with his arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said determinedly, "No, I must make this omelet tonight. You just go wait for me in the living room. I'll give it another try."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Elliott simply stripped off his black sweater. Wearing only a tight black tank top underneath, his muscular physique was immediately on display.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I inexplicably blushed, and my heart rate suddenly started racing. To avoid further hormonal overdrive, I quickly left the kitchen, leaving it once again to Elliott.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="204.html">« Prev</a><a href="206.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
