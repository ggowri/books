His words were like thunder, hitting me hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he had already picked Giselle up and strode into the B-ultrasonic room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't look back, but I could imagine the image of him holding Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart which was gradually recovering was broken by his words and movements again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze, and Paige cursed, "Bastard! His kids deserve to have problems!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't bear it, so I quickly pulled Paige out of there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I returned to Fiona's office, I felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I looked strange, Fiona immediately poured me a glass of water, and then asked us in surprise, "What's wrong? What happened just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, that bastard, carried Giselle into the B-ultrasonic room in front of Madeline. He also said that their baby must be safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was so angry that she couldn't help but curse angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How could he do such a thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Fiona heard it, she was very angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I drank the water in one gulp and finally calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's his child after all, even if he doesn't care about Giselle, he must care about his children," I said and felt a pain in my heart again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the child in your belly is the real one..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was tempted to retort. However, she realized that it was inappropriate, so she stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at her and said firmly, "Fiona, don't mention this to anyone in the future. I hope you and Paige can keep it a secret for me. This child belongs only to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that she had said the wrong thing, Fiona immediately nodded and said, "Okay, I will be careful in the future. Paige, don't tell Philip about this, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't mention it to him. Don't worry," Paige patted her chest and promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the three of us chatted for a while, I sent Paige back to her residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, we chatted. However, just as we were about to arrive at Paige's home, a red sports car drove towards us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sports car was a Ferrari convertible, which was very eye-catching from a distance. The driver was a woman wearing sunglasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The path to Paige's house was a bit narrow, so I slowed down when I saw a car ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the woman driving the sports car had no intention of slowing down at all. She sped towards us and passed by quickly. Then she turned a corner quickly and disappeared from our sight in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is this woman so panicked? She's driving so fast. Isn't she afraid of an accident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was so frightened that she clutched her chest and cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, she seems to be arrogant while driving a Ferrari!" I was also frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's strange. This is the road to my house. Why did she look like she had come out of my house?" Paige muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you sure this road only leads to your house?" I was stunned and asked quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I recalled that woman. Although she was wearing sunglasses, I felt like I had seen this woman before somewhere.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="556.html">« Prev</a><a href="558.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
