Instead, he just sat there and ate slowly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many people got pregnant after taking Dr. Cullen's medicine. If you don't believe it, I'll take you there to see it yourself another day. Madeline, if you and Elliott have a baby soon, Elliott's parents will be very happy..." Nicole said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked very kind and seemed to expect us to have a baby.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Giselle interrupted Nicole,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you shouldn't push them to have children. Elliott and Madeline must have their own plans. If they want to have children, they will prepare for it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I understand. Mrs. Laura Bryant has always wanted a grandson, so I was worried about her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole kept smiling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. Elliott and Madeline are still young, and it won't be too late for them to have children even in two years. Do you think so, Madeline?" Giselle looked at me with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing wrong with what she had said, but I felt that there seemed to be other meanings in her words, and she didn't want us to have a child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm planning to prepare for pregnancy. Considering that Cormac gets older, I think it'll be better if I get pregnant earlier. Right, Elliott?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, I didn't want Giselle to have any pleasure from me, even if she just wanted to get the upper hand in our conversations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately brought the topic to Elliott, seeing how he would answer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had mentioned earlier that he wanted to have children, but I didn't agree. Now that I said this, he was naturally overjoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and replied, "Yes, of course."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he spoke, Giselle's face suddenly darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She put down her fork and asked in frustration, "So when are you going to have a baby?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before the end of this year. We will work hard," Elliott said calmly and didn't notice Giselle's expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from his reactions, I did not feel that he cared about Giselle. Otherwise, he wouldn't have talked about our relationship so naturally.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why did Giselle's Instagram convey a message that she and Elliott had frequently contacted each other?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Elliott so good at pretending in front of me, or was Giselle trying to confuse me on purpose?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled faintly, "Well, you need to replenish your strength tonight. Have more Nicole's seafood soup."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Elliott curled up his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I have a stomachache. I want to go to the room for a while."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea about whether it was because Giselle couldn't bear it anymore. She suddenly put down her fork, turned around, and hurried upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she turned around, I saw her eyes seem slightly red, as if she was about to cry.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="218.html">« Prev</a><a href="220.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
