Watching his extremely smooth movements, especially the continuous peeling of the apple skin in circles, I couldn't help but exclaim, "Quinn, you know how to do this too, I didn't expect that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew how to do a lot of things. This one is so simple. Sometimes the club gets too busy and the bartender can't keep up, so I personally made the fruit platters." Quinn became even more proud and pleased when he heard me praising him like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I laughed all of a sudden and said, "Really? Then one day I will go to your club and you can personally make a fruit platter for me to see if you're bragging or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You come, don't mention the fruit platter, I can also make you a cocktail. I recently learned a new cocktail called Tequila Sunrise, it tastes really good and is very suitable for you girls to drink. After you recover from your injury, I will make it for you then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, by the way, let me ask you, have Paige and Philip been getting close lately?" I suddenly remembered what Paige said that day, so I quickly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, upon hearing my question, immediately had a gossipy expression on his face. He mysteriously said, "I don't know how close you two are, but lately, you've been hanging out together quite often. Philip himself is a playboy, and it seems like your best friend is quite similar. They seem to make a good match. Oh, by the way, Alexis seems to be helping your other friend with a case related to academic copyright, and they have been in frequent contact."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another best friend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it Fiona?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't heard them mention this matter before, so I quickly asked, "Is Philip a playboy? A man who often goes out should have many women, right? Are you talking about Fiona? She didn't tell me she's been involved in a lawsuit recently. I must have been out of touch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip? Well, how should I put it, he was a bit of a player, but I guess it's because he never really met a woman he genuinely liked, right? Your best friend, I think she's quite flirtatious too, isn't she?" Quinn and I had a discuss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She was just superficially flirtatious, but in reality, she didn't fool around. She just loved going to nightclubs. I don't care, if Philip is unreliable, you keep an eye on them and make sure they don't get too close, so as not to hurt my best friend later on." I was afraid that if they got too close, there would be problems, so I warned Quinn in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They currently seem to only enjoy playing together, I can't really sense anything else. But Alexis and Fiona, on the other hand, I do feel like they are quite compatible. One is a lawyer and the other is a doctor, it feels just right, haha..." Quinn said, suddenly becoming excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as he said that, I instantly recalled the scene from that evening in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexis's gentle and refined face and Fiona's somewhat aloof face flashed before me. Indeed, both of them, in terms of appearance and profession, were indeed a perfect match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexis wouldn't mess up, right?" I quickly inquired for the sake of my best friend's future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He lived a disciplined life, every day he would either go to work or exercise, a typical academic man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That did indeed match well with Fiona-"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cough, cough..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were joking about gossip between friends, and no one noticed that Elliott had turned around at some point, with a completely downcast expression on his face.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="169.html">« Prev</a><a href="171.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
