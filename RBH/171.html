He knew that if he continued gossiping with me, Elliott would probably get angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he stopped, stood up, and pretended to be serious, saying, "I have something to do, so I'll go back first today. Take care of yourself, and if you need anything, you can call me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can leave now, she doesn't need anything. If she needs anything, she can just come to me." Elliott couldn't wait to give the order to leave, it seems that his patience with Quinn has reached its limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, after all, you're her husband. Alright, I'll leave first then." Quinn suppressed a smile and quickly left the ward before Elliott could get angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn left, Elliott finally moved over and sat next to me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me eating the apple that Quinn had peeled for me, he suddenly said somewhat gloomily, "You seem to get along well with Quinn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lowered my head and bit into the apple, not thinking much. I casually said, "He has a lively and talkative personality. The more you get to know him, the more you feel that he's pretty good. He also has a wide range of hobbies. By the way, he mentioned that he graduated from Washington University, but I really couldn't tell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had no expression and calmly said, "So what, I had a dual degree from Harvard University."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this statement, there was clearly a strong sense of showing off. Was he trying to compete with Quinn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to when Quinn first walked in the door until now, his series of reactions really reminded me of how I used to get jealous and compete with other women for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, was he jealous of me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Really? He would still get jealous of me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of questions immediately popped into my head, and at that moment, I saw him pick up another apple and diligently peel it with a fruit knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for a man like Elliott, who could easily handle billion-dollar multinational negotiations, it was truly difficult for him to peel an apple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He peeled for a long time, and in the end, there was only a small amount of apple flesh left in his hand, which was also bumpy. Most of the apple flesh fell into the trash bin along with the peel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he was peeling it for himself to eat, but I didn't expect that after he finished peeling, he actually took the remaining half of the apple from my hand and threw it directly into the trash can. Then, he forcefully handed me the apple he had peeled and said lightly, "Try this one, it's sweeter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't eat it either, so how did he know it was sweeter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This action clearly showed that he minded me eating the apple that Quinn had peeled, but he just didn't say it explicitly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Elliott to have such a childish side. I couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time. I had to give him face, so I picked up the apple he had peeled and took a bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's glacially cold face finally showed a hint of melting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, his assistant Barry knocked on the door and entered the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry's expression appeared somewhat hurried as he timidly glanced at me first, then he leaned in towards Elliott's ear and whispered two sentences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I noticed that Elliott's expression changed immediately, and then he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry turned and walked out, and at that moment, Elliott also stood up and said to me, "You take a good rest first, I have something to attend to and will be back soon."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="170.html">« Prev</a><a href="172.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
