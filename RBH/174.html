It turns out that even though I set up obstacles time and time again, even though I took away her script in advance, she still managed to become Elliott's one and only dream lover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this, is something I can never reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love is truly something that makes people feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dialed Elliott's phone number once again, and this time, Elliott finally answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's side sounded very quiet, like being in a closed compartment. However, Elliott's voice was a bit tense and accompanied by a slight panting sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, I was busy just now and didn't hear the phone ring."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The quiet atmosphere, the faint breathing sound, and the ambiguous phrase "just busy", instantly painted a picture in my mind that only adults understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart felt like it was suddenly lifted up, a wave of powerless dull pain spreading from my heart to my whole body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, what were you busy with? Didn't you say you would be back in a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The company just had a meeting, and there happened to be some urgent matters. You rest first, I will be there in a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice still carried a slight panting, and I didn't know what he was doing or why he seemed a bit struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The astonishing imagination made my brain confused, and just at this moment, what made me suffocated even more was that I faintly heard a woman's weak and feeble voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was very weak, very weak, but on the other end of the phone, it was so quiet, so quiet that the sound seemed exceptionally clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to listen carefully again, however, at that moment, there came a burst of sound from the other end of the phone, as if two people had collided violently, the sound sometimes becoming noisy, sometimes very chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about ten seconds, finally, the other end of the phone became quiet again. Surprisingly, there was a hint of nervousness in Elliott's tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, there was a little situation just now, but I will be back soon. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could say anything, Elliott had already hung up the phone in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The busy tone "beep beep" came from the other end of the phone. I held the phone in my hand, which was shaking uncontrollably, and my palms, along with my back, were covered in sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I checked the call time, it was only two minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these two minutes were more agonizing for me than any other time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A drunken and powerless woman, and a strong and powerful young man, both of them in the same compartment. Who would believe that nothing would happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, just now Elliott's tone, including his voice, sounded completely different from usual, and the sound emitted by Giselle, clearly sounded like...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dared not continue to think further, for if I continued, I would not be able to resist getting up from the sickbed and going to Elliott's car to find out what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart still ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I kept telling myself over and over again that I no longer cared about Elliott, I was still, after all, his lawful wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found that I simply couldn't accept how well Elliott treated Giselle, let alone how close he was to her.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="173.html">« Prev</a><a href="175.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
