Finally, I found a fleeting moment to catch my breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the excuse of hunger, I distanced myself temporarily from the high society crowd and slipped away to the refreshments area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This truly embodied the essence of an elite social gathering. The refreshments on the yacht looked exceptionally refined. Even a tiny pastry was crafted into a work of art, not only visually enticing but also boasting a unique taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pregnant women always had hearty appetites, and I indulged in several desserts at once, even sampled two pieces of cupcakes, finally feeling a hint of satisfaction in my belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed a glass of grape juice that looked remarkably like wine from the refreshments area and stood aside to savor it slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I sipped my juice, I suddenly felt like someone had been staring at me all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I glanced toward those eyes, only to find myself staring at a familiar face. It was Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a regular at these gatherings but became low-key for a while and seldom attended. I wondered what prompted her to start enjoying these occasions again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, she was accompanied by an elegant, tall woman, around forty years old. And this woman, I felt like I'd seen her somewhere before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from their demeanor, they had clearly been discussing me just now. So, I raised my head, and their gazes couldn't avoid mine. They looked somewhat sheepish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Laura saw me raise my head, she was first stunned, then immediately broke into a warm smile and walked towards me without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you doing here? You're pregnant, wearing high heels and such a long dress isn't very safe. It wouldn't be good if you fell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura came closer, staring at my belly as if she regarded the baby inside me as her own grandchild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but furrow my brow, instinctively tightening my abdomen, then said coldly, "You don't have to worry about it, Mrs. Laura Bryant. It's my child, and of course, I'll take good care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why are you so distant from me? You used to call me Laura affectionately. I know I didn't do well before, but please don't take it to heart. By the way, I watched your speech. It was brilliant. I'm proud of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura excitedly rubbed her hands together, her eyes fixed on my belly, and she still tried to maintain closeness with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I finally understood Elliott's capricious attitude. It seemed to run in the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both mother and son had this demeanor, constantly changing like the weather. Sometimes, they were enthusiastic, while other times, they would freeze you out like you were in a refrigerator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was tough to understand their way of thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, have you got dementia? Have you forgotten that you personally sent the divorce license to my house? And now you keep pretending we are close. Don't you think it is embarrassing? I find it incredibly awkward," I replied mercilessly, giving her a cold glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was taken aback, probably not expecting me to be so ruthless. Her face turned pale instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she swiftly adjusted her attitude and smiled again after a while, "Because I didn't know you were pregnant, Madeline. I hope you can forgive my oversight. Anyway, take good care of yourself during the pregnancy. Don't be as careless as Giselle, who is always on the edge of a miscarriage. That's enough to give anyone a scare."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="571.html">« Prev</a><a href="573.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
