I always believed that love was the most important thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I realized he was just a part of my life. There were many more wonderful things in this world worth exploring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this realization, my once heavy heart became much more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughing and chatting, Marcus and I walked to my doorstep. Suddenly, I looked up and saw a figure standing there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was leaning against the wall next to the gate. The dim evening light obscured his expression, but his aura was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "What's going on? Isn't he supposed to be in the hospital with a fever?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he be standing alone at my doorstep?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stopped in my tracks. Marcus also noticed Elliott and instinctively asked, "Mr. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then looked at me, seemingly seeking confirmation. I lowered my head, unsure of what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott would never have done something like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so proud. When I was sick with a cold and fever in the past, Elliott never even glanced at me, let alone show such humility. And now, Elliott was still sick, yet he stubbornly appeared at my doorstep time and time again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "It's late at night. How long has he been standing at my doorstep, waiting for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no choice but to approach him. Seeing him weakly leaning there, I couldn't help but scold him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you're still sick! What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly opened his eyes. Up close, I could feel his weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glanced at me, then at Marcus. Then, a cold smile crept onto his pale, sickly face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So late, and you're still with Marcus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus walked over. He probably couldn't quite figure out what the relationship between Elliott and I was now, so he quickly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, please don't misunderstand. Madeline just came to my house for business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott chuckled, glaring at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What business? Why are you discussing business so late? Mr. James, are you two alone in your house?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, it's just the two of us in my house. But we're discussing business. Please rest assured," Marcus patiently explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott refused to drop the subject. His eyes were like those of a wolf's, gleaming in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't trust you, Mr. James. Madeline is my woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After uttering these words, he couldn't hold back a violent fit of coughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him weak yet still trying to be tough, I suddenly felt angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I might have been moved by his jealousy and willingness to do anything for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I just felt an indescribable feeling of suffocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "I have said all the words that needed to be said. I have bid him farewell. Why is he still refusing to let go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Elliott was arrogant and untouchable. Where does that Elliott go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How does he become so different from the person I've been infatuated with for so many years? I don't even know why I've loved him for so long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, Elliott! Stop saying I'm your woman! I'm not anymore! I've told you I have someone I like. Please, stop bothering me, harassing me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't bear it any longer. It just slipped out of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Elliott's gaze darkened instantly. The next second, he clutched his chest and suddenly erupted into a series of violent coughs.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="476.html">« Prev</a><a href="478.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
