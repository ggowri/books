How blessed!</p><p>Ever since I married Elliott, his words were harsh, and tonight, his contempt for me seemed to grow. </p><p>&quot;Listen! One more food screw-up and I&#x27;m gone!&quot; Elliott glared at me, void of any affection.</p><p>&quot;Elliott, I&#x27;m your wife. Don&#x27;t you have any... love for me?&quot;</p><p>Memories of our past haunted me. I blurted out the question that gnawed at me in my final moments.</p><p>&quot;Love? You? If not for your family&#x27;s schemes, would we be together?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Schemes? That was my family saving yours! Without my dad&#x27;s two billion rescues, the Bryants would&#x27;ve sunk into that financial mess!&quot;</p><p>Two years back, the Bryants&#x27; huge oil venture in the Middle East halted due to an unforeseen war. Concurrently, a global economic crisis struck, shrinking the Bryants&#x27; wealth dramatically in a month. </p><p>Facing their financial ruin, I persuaded my dad to donate two billion dollars to help them recover. </p><p>Seizing this opportunity, I fulfilled my dream of marrying Elliott. </p><p>I was foolish then, believing that being with Elliott constantly would make him love me. </p><p>But over six years, Elliott repeatedly shattered my hopes, and ultimately I was killed by his damn first love.</p><p>Elliott lavished his affection on other women, leaving me with nothing but continuous pain.</p><p>My heart had given up to despair when I found solace in the depths of the sea.</p><p>In my new life, I swore no more foolish naivety!</p><p>&quot;Madeline, without those two billion, you wouldn&#x27;t even dream of marrying me. Be content with what you&#x27;ve got.&quot;</p><p>With these words, Elliott turned and walked away.</p><p>&quot;Elliott, since you hate me that much... let&#x27;s end this!&quot; I said calmly as he walked away.</p><p>He paused, laughed scornfully, then left confidently.</p><p>&quot;Fine, anytime you want!&quot;</p><p>After he left, I tried to stand, supporting my trembling body.</p><p>Looking in the mirror, I saw a mess - tangled hair, empty eyes, flushed cheeks from meds, and my ripped nightie revealing my skinny arms and collarbones. </p><p>I&#x27;d starved myself to fit Elliott&#x27;s ideal - long-haired, skinny women. Now, I was 5.7 feet tall and only 94 pounds. </p><p>My resulting stomach cancer was probably from neglecting myself and enduring constant stress. </p><p>I swore never to jeopardize my health for someone else&#x27;s ideals.</p><p>With that in my mind, I threw away all my diet pills.</p><p>Elliott claimed we could divorce whenever.</p><p>Since then, let it be tomorrow.</p><p>In my past life, I put up with Elliott&#x27;s growing disdain till it was too late.</p><p>But this time, I chose to let him go, and more importantly, free myself early.</p><p>After a sleepless night, as dawn broke, I dug out my old favorite jeans and a white shirt from my closet, untouched since marriage. </p><p>I casually knotted the shirt and walked out with the divorce papers in my pocket.</p><p>Then, I headed straight to Bryant Group, took the VIP elevator to Elliott&#x27;s office, knocked and walked in.</p><p>Now, we were just married for only two years, playing the perfect couple.</p><p>At this point, I could still move freely in Bryant Group, not yet so low that even their security looked down on me.</p><p>Behind his big desk, Elliott&#x27;s brows furrowed upon seeing me.</p><p>&quot;What are you here for?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ve drafted the divorce agreement. Take a look. Sign it if no problems.&quot;</p><p>I looked at him, my tone quite calm.</p><p>A flicker of surprise tinged his gaze. Dropping the pen he held, he smiled faintly, his voice detached yet laced with disdain.</p><p>&quot;Which act are you playing this time? Didn&#x27;t you have enough drama last night?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Elliott, I&#x27;m serious. Since you don&#x27;t love me, let&#x27;s end it sooner. It&#x27;s better for us.&quot;</p><p>Maybe I had let go of him completely. There was no ripple in my emotions when I spoke these words.</p><p>Elliott&#x27;s face darkened. He stood up abruptly, circled the desk, and loomed in front of me. Pinching my chin, he locked eyes with me, a sneer playing on his lips.</p><p>&quot;What? Drugged me and failed, now another trick? Madeline, drop the games. I don&#x27;t have time for you, got it?&quot;</p><p>He then ripped up the divorce papers right in front of me and growled, &quot;Get out!&quot;</p><p>In the past, his harsh gaze would silence me immediately.</p><p>Every fight ended with me backing down, crushing my dignity.</p><p>However, I was my parent&#x27;s precious daughter, pampered and loved.</p><p>But for love, I made myself nothing before Elliott, burying my pride and self-respect.</p><p>I used to fear Elliott mentioning divorce, considering how hard I worked for this marriage.</p><p>But now, looking at this cold man, all I wanted was to get away and cut all ties and feelings for him.</p><p>&quot;Fine. Whenever you&#x27;ve made up your mind, just let me know. I&#x27;m done with this charade.&quot;</p><p>I left these words behind and turned to leave his office.</p><p>At that moment, I heard a clear, shattering sound of broken glass behind me.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="1.html">« Prev</a><a href="3.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
