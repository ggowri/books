In my lifetime, I never thought Elliott would spend money on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even without me, he would still spend money like water on other women, so why should I save money for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who knew how much longer could I be Mrs. Bryant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After paying, Elliott took me out of the high-end clothing store. Once we got in the car, I said to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just send me back to my parents' house."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go back to Serenity Villa tonight. Your parents would think I've bullied you if you always live in their place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott said so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he had said such a thing. In the past, he used to wish that he could distance himself from me as much as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents are still waiting for me, so let me live there for a while first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still resisted going back to the place where we used to live together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, no matter how magnificent and spacious a place was, it felt cold and lifeless without love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have already talked to your parents that you won't go back tonight. They have gone to bed now, so it wouldn't be nice to disturb them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Elliott had already spoken to my parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head and looked at him in surprise. He didn't look at me, his gaze remaining fixed on the road ahead. From my perspective, his profile was sculpted and natural, even his Adam's apple appeared particularly sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any woman would not be able to control herself and would fall in love with him when facing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I no longer loved him, I had to admit that I still appreciated his looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no feelings for him now only because there was a scar in my heart, which was hard for me to overcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we were talking, Toby had already driven the car into the underground parking lot of Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I took the elevator side by side into Serenity Villa. As soon as we entered, Sean immediately came over and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, Mrs. Bryant, you came back just in time. Mrs. Laura Bryant cooked soup today and had someone deliver it specially to you for your health. The soup is still hot. How about I serve each of you some, perfect for a late-night snack? What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Sean saw me coming back with Elliott, there was a visible joy on his face, and even his voice sounded a bit excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm hungry. I'll take a shower first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew Laura's tricks very well, so I directly refused it, fearing that there was some problem with the soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a bit hungry. Serve me some please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, Elliott, who had never had the habit of eating night snacks, said that he was hungry for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that, Sean immediately went to serve soup to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I went upstairs first. After I finished removing my makeup and taking a shower, I was getting ready to sleep when Elliott pushed open the bedroom door with a flushed face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that this soup was indeed "nutritious".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you come here? Did you want me to sleep in the guest room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said with some surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he laughed. Recently he had been laughing more often in front of me. He walked over, peeled off the mask on my face, and threw it into the nearby trash bin. Without hesitation, his two big hands embraced my waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is not good for couples to sleep in separate beds. Tonight, shall we sleep together, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were somewhat obsessed, with a slight flush on his face as if he had been drinking. The tone of his voice also became unusually gentle, which startled me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="42.html">« Prev</a><a href="44.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
