He insists you sign the divorce papers tonight. Madeline Bryant, it&#x27;s time to stop dreaming.&quot;</p><p>On the cruise deck, a storm was raging and I was a mess, confronting Giselle Cole.</p><p>Today was the sixth anniversary of my marriage to Elliott Bryant, and this cruise ship was where we first met.</p><p>I never imagined my blood-written plea for one more meeting wouldn&#x27;t sway Elliott from divorcing me. He even had his sweetheart deliver the papers.</p><p>How heartless!</p><p>&quot;And, I&#x27;m pregnant with Elliott&#x27;s baby. You and him, it&#x27;s over,&quot; Giselle bragged, her growing bump proof of her hold on Elliott. </p><p>How ironic!</p><p>I had always longed for a child in our six-year marriage, but Elliott never once touched me.</p><p>Now he and Giselle are expecting a baby. </p><p>In the past, hearing such news, I would have lunged at her in a blind rage, tearing into her like a wild animal.</p><p>But now, I was too drained to outdo Giselle.</p><p>&quot;Fine, I&#x27;ll sign.&quot; </p><p>Without another word, I reached out with a trembling hand, smeared with blood, and scribbled my name on the paper.</p><p>Giselle was shocked by my swift agreement, then her face lit up with joy.</p><p>She stowed away the divorce papers as if they were treasure, and the large diamond ring on her slender finger glinted, making my head reel.</p><p>Six years of marriage, and I never got such a ring. </p><p>I loved Elliott and even jeopardized my family for him, yet he gave me nothing. Not even a goodbye. </p><p>&quot;Does Elliott know I&#x27;m sick?&quot; I asked weakly, unable to accept the harsh truth. </p><p>Ten years of love, it wasn&#x27;t easy to let go. </p><p>&quot;He knows. He said you&#x27;re a burden. He&#x27;d prefer if you were gone,&quot; Giselle shot back, her words as cold as Elliott&#x27;s.</p><p>In my despair, I didn&#x27;t doubt her - those had to be Elliott&#x27;s words. </p><p>I hadn&#x27;t seen him in two months since he proposed divorce. He left and cut me off. His friends and family treated me like an outcast, hiding his location. </p><p>With my parents gone and assets transferred, I was useless to him. Despite my terminal cancer, he was quick to leave me for his dream woman. He was truly heartless!</p><p>Still, I clung to him, my only love. I hoped for one last meeting to end our decade-long story.</p><p>&quot;Can you set up a last meeting with him?&quot; I begged Giselle.</p><p>&quot;No need. You&#x27;re just a disaster! What&#x27;d it solve?&quot; She sneered, queen-like.</p><p>&quot;Can I call him... please?&quot; I backed off. Just his voice one more time would do.</p><p>&quot;Madeline, I&#x27;d never stoop so low for a man. Can&#x27;t you see? The more you beg, the less they respect you. Maybe next life treats you better,&quot; Giselle scoffed, grabbing me. Her scorn stung.</p><p>She had everything, while I, once privileged, was now desperate. How&#x27;d I end up here?</p><p>As I lost myself in thought, two hefty guards moved in, silencing me with duct tape and tying me up.</p><p>&quot;Madeline, it&#x27;s time you disappeared from Elliott&#x27;s life. I&#x27;ve had enough of you...&quot;</p><p>Before I could react, they hurled me into the sea. Giselle&#x27;s words echoed in my ears as seawater filled my lungs. I was helpless against the current pulling me deeper into the sea.</p><p>As my consciousness began to slip, I felt a force tug at my arm. Someone seemed to be pulling me towards the surface, but the storm was relentless. </p><p>Then, everything went black.</p><p>This pitiful, insignificant life of mine had been abruptly ended by Elliott&#x27;s damn dream girl.</p><p>A splash of cold water jolted me awake. I forced my eyes open to find Elliott standing over me!</p><p>&quot;Madeline, stooping so low as to drug me? You&#x27;re beneath contempt! I wouldn&#x27;t touch you, let alone get you pregnant!&quot; </p><p>His face was twisted with disgust as he turned off the shower. </p><p><em>Hadn&#x27;t Giselle thrown me into the sea? </em></p><p><em>Why was I waking up in Elliott&#x27;s bathroom? </em></p><p>I looked around, trying to understand my surroundings.</p><p>The bathroom was a mess, with shower gel and a toothbrush scattered on the floor. Elliott was dressed in a dark suit, his hair and chest soaked. His eyes were filled with anger.</p><p>Clearly, the recent process had been intense.</p><p>This scene was all too familiar, and I suddenly remembered.</p><p>This should be four years ago, on the second anniversary of my marriage to Elliott.</p><p>That day, I asked the housemaid Teresa to bring a remedy from the countryside. She claimed it could help me conceive. Excited, I added it to the soup, imagining a romantic night with Elliott under the influence of the drug.</p><p>I was truly desperate at that time. After two years of marriage with no sign of pregnancy, my in-laws and the entire upper-class society in Hoswich spread rumors that I couldn&#x27;t provide heirs for the Bryant family. Then, women close to Elliott, aiming to bear his child, were increasing.</p><p>Tormented day and night, I reluctantly resorted to this method.</p><p>However, for some reason, Elliott saw through it.</p><p>He was furious, pouring the soup down my throat in front of all the servants and then dragging me into the bedroom.</p><p>The potent medicine quickly took effect, and I lost control, tearing my nightgown into pieces. I repeatedly pounced on Elliott uncontrollably.</p><p>Finally, he dragged me into the bathroom and ruthlessly showered me with the showerhead, exactly like the current situation.</p><p>I suddenly realized I had been reborn! I was back to the time of my second wedding anniversary with Elliott.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="0.html">« Prev</a><a href="2.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
