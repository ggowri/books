Immediately, I moved towards the direction of the wardrobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed closely behind me. "What are you packing for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to stay in Louis City for a while," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to Louis City? When? Is it necessary to go?" His tone instantly became nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I have to go, I plan to leave this afternoon." I didn't intend to hide it from Elliott, after all, we haven't divorced yet, and he will eventually find out about my trip to Louis City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he was at my house today, I might as well tell him everything and let him be mentally prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened the wardrobe and started packing up my clothes to be changed, but in reality, my heart was in chaos and I didn't have the mood to tidy up at all. I randomly grabbed a few clothes and stuffed them into the suitcase, with only one thought in mind - to escape, far away from Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott leaned against the edge of the wardrobe, silently watching me. I wasn't sure if it was the fact that I was going to Louis City that made him suddenly quiet or something else. He didn't speak for a while, until I finished packing and closed the suitcase. Then, he softly said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you haven't asked me if I agree or not," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, he still seemed to want to exercise his authority as a husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head and looked into his eyes. I said calmly, "I believe that we have already said everything we needed to say in these past few days, Elliott. Our divorce is just a matter of time, so there's no need to pretend to be a couple anymore. We're both tired, aren't we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked into his deep brown eyes, and at that moment, my heart was very calm, so calm that there was not a single ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also looked at me, and I could feel a hint of sadness in his eyes, but I didn't know what he was sad about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't he supposed to be the one who should feel the most fortunate, that this annoying pest of mine finally stopped bothering him day and night, waiting for his pity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the feeling he gave me, however, seemed as if he was very disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We stared at each other for a few seconds like this. However, just when I thought he was accepting reality, he suddenly thundered towards me and blocked me against the wardrobe door!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even react, he eagerly kissed my lips!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faint grape wine, accompanied by the scent of alcohol, instantly flooded into my lips along with his tongue, before I could react, he had already begun to passionately conquer my lips and teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried to struggle, but he just held me tightly and with a swift turn, he forcefully pinned me down on my princess bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of us fell into my cloud-like soft quilt together, and he kissed me with deep affection and tenderness, as if the end of the world was imminent, regardless of any resistance from me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, I still had my eyes open, but later, under his relentless attack, my sanity was gradually eroded by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was truly a master in the realm of romance, his kissing skills were skilled and experienced, while I, who had never been touched by such experiences, could never be his match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this time he clearly had no intention of showing any mercy. He not only kissed me fiercely, but his hands, without me realizing it, had already slipped under my clothes. The soft and warm fingertips were slowly spreading along my smooth skin inch by inch...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="186.html">« Prev</a><a href="188.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
