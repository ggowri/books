Then, I set up a date with Marcus in front of Elliott for the next time we could have dinner alone and catch up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't say much. However, no sooner had Marcus left than Elliott looked grim directly. He glanced at me with a curious gaze and said, "I can't believe I didn't know before that you had such a dignified old friend."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was full of jealousy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, I couldn't help but tease with a smile, "Well, why do I have a strange feeling? Is someone jealous again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately added the word "again". As expected, Elliott looked even angrier for a split second.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just had a nice chat and even set up a date for our next dinner together, but did you ask my permission?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was unconsciously exerting his hegemony again. As soon as he finished speaking, he turned and walked into his office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rushed to follow him and said, "What's wrong? Am I not allowed to have dinner with an old friend?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were so angry when someone arranged flowers in my office. What's wrong? Are you the only one who can do whatever you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, it was Elliott's turn to be sarcastic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his tone, he seemed to be defending himself from what had happened to Giselle that morning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're worried about your sweetheart, are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was instantly disgruntled and couldn't help but raise my fist in protest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott directly gripped my fist with his warm and strong hand and yanked so tightly that my whole body instantly fell into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pinched my nose harshly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart? What are you babbling about all day? If you ever casually seduce another man in front of me again, don't blame me for being rude to you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had fallen into his arms, so I had to reach up and wrap my arms around his neck. I blinked and said, "What do you mean? I'm socializing normally, and I'm not your captive pet. What's wrong? I'm not allowed to eat with people normally, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems you don't know chalk from cheese."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott leaned down to look at me. His eyes had just been serious, but now they were filled with lust.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this happen?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We just had sex last night. It's daytime at work, but what's going on in his mind?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized something was wrong and struggled in panic, trying to get up from his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could he let me go so easily?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already lowered his head and kissed me on the lips before I started to struggle. At the same time, he touched my waist directly with his strong hand through the hem of my suit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A limp and numb feeling like a slight electric shock went through my entire body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh, dear! He wouldn't want to have sex here, would he?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My face went flushed. I pressed his hand down in panic and said, "Elliott, it's working hours. What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of stopping, he became intensified and bit my earlobe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with working hours? It's my office, so I call the shots."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a glacier in his abstinence, but he was like a flame when he was full of desire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, the door is open. What if someone comes in?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but exclaim in a whisper.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="357.html">« Prev</a><a href="359.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
