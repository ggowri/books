Meanwhile, I caught a glimpse of a figure standing quietly by the railing on the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I activated the hands-free mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't she like to act innocent in front of Elliott?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, why not let him listen and see what his dream lover was really like behind his back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, Giselle heard my words and instantly became furious on the other end of the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what are you trying to do? Who cares about your old clothes? Why did you send them to my mom's flower shop? Do you take us for beggars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, letting out a sarcastic chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right, I'm just giving alms to beggars. I know you've been coveting those old clothes of mine for a long time, just like you covet my man and everything else I have. It's okay, I can give them all to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly provoked by my words, Giselle's hysterical voice immediately erupted from the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, who the hell are you calling a beggar? Don't act like a rich heiress in front of me. Let me tell you, you won't be anything soon! I don't need your charity. Instead, you should pity yourself. If it weren't for you being unable to bear children, how could I have had the chance to bear Elliott's child? Once I become his wife and the owner of the Bryant Villa, I'll have everything. Keep those old clothes for yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle couldn't have anticipated that I had put the call on hands-free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she finished shouting those words, Elliott had already come downstairs. He stood before me with a dark expression. His hands were in his pockets, and he was silently staring at the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remained silent. Perhaps Giselle thought her words had wounded me so she let out a maniacal laugh on the other end of the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Madeline, I forgot to tell you something. Do you know about the Bryant Group's new TV series, 'Allure'? The lead actress in that show happens to be my best friend, Jezebel. I casually mentioned it to Elliott, and he immediately agreed to let her be the lead actress and even signed her as an artist under the Bryant Group. Do you really think Elliott doesn't care about me? If he didn't care about me, how could I still be at the Bryant Group? I've even moved into the Bryant Villa, and I'm now pregnant with his child. He's just putting on a show for you. Once my child is born, Elliott's heart will be firmly in my grasp. Madeline, it's not too late for you to back out now. Otherwise, you'll really become a joke in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the phone, I could almost envision Giselle's smug and triumphant expression at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a confident voice and precise words of insult, her energetic demeanor didn't resemble that of a pregnant woman safeguarding her unborn child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face was now very dark. He stood before me, still looking at my phone with a terrifying gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, did you hear that just now? Those were the words of Giselle, the woman you said had a hard time growing up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled lightly, deliberately waving the phone in front of Elliott and sneering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There seemed to be a sound like something falling to the ground on the other end of the line, followed by a crisp, shattering noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps her phone had fallen to the ground. After a moment of chaos, Giselle's panicked voice quickly came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Elliott is beside you? How is that possible? Madeline, you must be lying to me, aren't you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="414.html">« Prev</a><a href="416.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
