Quinn gently patted my shoulder, comforting me in a soft voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's all in the past now. As long as he's happy." I forced myself to detach from the pain, nodding with an air of acceptance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go then. I'll take you home and also share the good news from today's checkup with your parents," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully supported me, and we walked together to his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drove me home, and along the way, we passed by a gift shop. He made a quick stop and soon returned to the car carrying several boxes of valuable supplements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him with all those supplements, I was dumbfounded. "Quinn, what are these for?" I asked, shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are for your parents," he replied matter-of-factly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was utterly surprised. "Quinn, hold on. Don't you think this is a bit too much, too soon? Have you considered the consequences?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not treating this lightly, Madeline. I'm serious. As long as your parents agree, I'm willing to get engaged and married to you, and I'll treat your child as my own. I mean what I say," he said with utmost sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was completely taken aback, not knowing what to say for a moment. After a long pause, I shook my head vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, even if you want to marry me, I'm not ready for marriage yet. Quinn, I appreciate your kindness, and I know you're doing this for my sake, but this isn't what I want. I still want to walk my own path for a while," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never imagined jumping into another relationship or marriage so quickly after parting ways with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I understood that Quinn was doing this to give my unborn child a legitimate status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I wasn't ready for things to progress so quickly, feeling completely unprepared mentally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's hold off on the engagement and marriage for now, but we definitely need to let your parents know about this. Otherwise, our charade might get exposed to them, and it would be hard to handle," Quinn respected my thoughts and said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," after much consideration, I agreed with him, realizing he had a point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly drove me home and accompanied me inside, carrying the boxes of supplements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad was in the living room watching TV when I returned with Quinn. My mom immediately warmly welcomed Quinn to stay for dinner, then hurried to the kitchen to prepare a few more dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly joined my dad for a game of chess while I went to the kitchen. I assisted my mom with cooking, chatting with her about today's checkup as we worked together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that everything was fine with the baby, she was overjoyed. "You know, Marcus really has some skills. The anti-flu capsules he developed controlled the flu virus this time, and the medication he prescribed for you to prevent miscarriage worked wonders too. I mentioned my backache recently, and he gave me a few patches. After using one, my back pain significantly eased. Their family's medical skills are truly remarkable," she said happily.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="544.html">« Prev</a><a href="546.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
