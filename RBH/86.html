Now, I live in the guest room to avoid him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For me, such separation used to be a torment. Now, I don't think so anymore. Because my time has been occupied by work. After I come home, I almost take a shower and go to sleep, no longer troubled by love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One morning, I arrived at the company as usual. I saw Adam talking to someone at the entrance. I was familiar with that person...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a boy about the same height as Adam. He had a backpack on his back and was carrying luggage. He appeared, unlike most young people, dejected and dispirited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he didn't shave, I immediately recognized him from afar as Rowan Fisher, Giselle's boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the luggage in his hands, I realized something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood still in place. After chatting for a while, Rowan and Adam waved goodbye to each other. Then, he turned around and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam turned around and walked towards the company. When he saw me standing at the door, he immediately ran towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good morning, Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good morning, Adam. Is that person your friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is Rowan, my good friend. I think I mentioned him to you before. His girlfriend wants to break up with him, he also lost his job, and he plans to go back to his hometown for a while, so he came to say goodbye to me," Adam told me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Giselle and Rowan break up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect them to break up so quickly. Rowan seemed to love Giselle, but he gave up so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he tell you why they broke up?" I couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam sighed, "His girlfriend went to the Planning Department of the Bryant Group. Interns who work there need at least a year to become full-time employees, but she quickly became a full-time employee and even became an assistant director. Rowan's girlfriend got promoted, but he remains the same, and his girlfriend complains that he is not working hard enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have been busy recently and have not paid attention to anything about the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Giselle to become a full-time employee so quickly, and she even got promoted to assistant director. It seems like her relationship with Elliott is progressing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, Elliott has been distant with me again. Moreover, I hardly see him anymore. I feel like he might only be interested in Giselle now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not a good sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to Adam's words, I fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam noticed that something was wrong with me. He asked, "Madeline, what's the matter? Did something I said upset you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I came to my senses and shook my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, since Giselle didn't like Rowan, why did you choose to be with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was taken aback for a moment, not expecting that I would ask this question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Although Rowan wasn't diligent enough, his father still had influence in his hometown. Although Giselle was excellent, her father passed away when she was young. Her family background was average. Moreover, Rowan had pursued her diligently in the past. So, they got together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle seemed to always have clear goals, not as simple as she appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think there is still a possibility for them to reconcile?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rowan planned to go back to his hometown to find a job. I think the chances are slim unless Rowan stays here and can make something happen," Adam replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to Adam's words, I had an idea and asked, "How was Rowan's ability?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="85.html">« Prev</a><a href="87.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
