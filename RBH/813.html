The herb seedlings have just been planted and haven't started to grow yet. It appears as nothing more than a flat expanse of brown earth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crescent moon hung high in the sky, casting a melancholic aura over the desolate fields. There were no inhabitants in sight. Yet, from this vantage point, I could faintly make out the twinkling lights at the foot of a mountain a kilometer away, suggesting the presence of a village.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally finding myself in such rural settings, with the chorus of frogs echoing across the fields, I find it rather pleasant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially here, where the climate is incredibly pleasant. The wind brushing against my face is soothing, adding to my overall sense of contentment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was standing outside, taking in the fresh air, when suddenly, the roar of an engine filled my ears. Moments later, I spotted a large black SUV barreling towards me from a distance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's Quinn's ride.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why on earth is he here too?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of joy hit me in an instant, and without a second thought, I bolted in that direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car came to a swift halt before me. In no time, Quinn hopped out from the driver's seat. He was clad in a dark denim jacket paired with grey trousers, exuding a casual vibe. A black earring adorned his right ear, his sleeves slightly rolled up. At some point, a tattoo had mysteriously appeared on his right arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what brings you here? You didn't come all this way just for me, did you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grin, I stepped forward and landed a punch on his arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instantly seized my hand, chuckling as he draped it over his shoulder. Then, he swiftly looped his arm around my neck from behind, twirling me around in a full circle before finally setting me down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed heartily, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard you've arrived in Norch City. I was a bit concerned. As it happens, I have some business to attend to here myself, so I thought I'd come straight over. Conveniently, I can also check on how your new venture in Norch City is progressing."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. And here I thought you came specifically to see me. Turns out you just dropped by because I was on your way."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stumbling upon a friend in unfamiliar surroundings always brings an unexpected joy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being with Quinn never put any pressure on me. So, seeing him always brings me joy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We exchanged a glance and shared a laugh. He then playfully pinched my nose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still teasing me. Alright, I admit it, I came all this way just to see you. And guess what? I brought you a bunch of delicious treats."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn finished speaking, he immediately swung the car door open, pulling out a large bag filled with all sorts of snacks and fruits. And the best part? They were all my favorites.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's truly considerate. He silently keeps in mind all the food I love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon laying my eyes on this massive bag of stuff, a wave of emotion washed over me in an instant:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading back the day after tomorrow. Why are you packing so much?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, eat up. When are you heading back the day after tomorrow? I'll book the flights now. I'll go back with you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn chuckled, playfully nudging my nose before asking me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We casually teased and joked with each other, a routine that had long become commonplace for us both.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as we huddled together, ready to check out the flight information, a chilling voice suddenly echoed from behind me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already booked Madeline's ticket. She's coming back to Hoswich City with me, so you don't have to worry about it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden voice jolted me back to reality in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that I realized Elliott was here too. In that moment, I hastily moved away from Quinn. Then, I turned back around, a bit awkwardly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood there, his expression unreadable. His eyes, cold and piercing, watched us, as if brewing a storm of complex emotions within...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="812.html">« Prev</a><a href="814.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
