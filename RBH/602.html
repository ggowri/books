It was already too late when Quinn and I came to our senses and went to stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip's cool hairstyle was instantly ruined. His face and clothes were both stained with cola, making him look disheveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt he was disgraced. Philip stood up and shouted at Paige, "Paige, don't cross the line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige pointed at Philip and exclaimed, "Who's crossing the line, you or me? Philip, you're betraying me while I am pregnant. Do you think you're right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you are pregnant, I will forgive you this time. Don't go too far again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip didn't realize his mistake. Instead, he got angry. He quickly picked up the tissue on the table and wiped his head and face haphazardly. Then, he furiously threw away the tissue and slammed the door as he left the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Philip, don't be impulsive. Calm down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn noticed things got too serious and immediately chased after Philip, wanting to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, I grabbed Paige's arm and said, "Paige, don't be angry. You are already in the late stages of pregnancy. Being emotional is not good for you and your baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Philip doesn't realize he is wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Paige was so angry that she could hardly breathe. She placed her hand on her chest. As she finished speaking, tears streamed down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her, I felt sorry for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly said, "I understand how you feel, but now you are pregnant. For your baby's sake, you got to stay calm, you know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I overheard your conversation. Did you and Quinn already know something? Is Jezebel the woman he's with? Madeline, tell me the truth. If so, I'm going to teach her a good lesson," Paige said exasperatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, she heard what we just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she had already known everything, I didn't hide it from her anymore. I nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her trembling with anger, I comforted her, "Paige, take a deep breath. For your baby on the way, you have to calm yourself down. Quinn and I didn't tell you because of your baby. Don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby..." Paige interrupted me, looking at her belly, and suddenly, she struck it twice. She said in a choked voice, "I'm afraid I'm the only one who cares about this baby. If his father is a jerk, it's better for this baby not to come into this world. I have to make Philip explain everything to me. I need to know it all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige couldn't let it go easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She broke free from my hands, opened the door, and rushed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly caught up with her. Just as we walked out of the restaurant, the scene in front of me made me freeze in place.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="601.html">« Prev</a><a href="603.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
