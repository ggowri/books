Come on. I&#x27;ll teach you.&quot;</p><p>Hearing Elliott&#x27;s voice, I stopped reflexively. Paige heard it, too, and she suddenly became angry.</p><p>&quot;Is Elliott fooling around with that actress again? He&#x27;s married! This is unreasonable!&quot;</p><p>Such a thing happened countless times in my previous life. Back then, I rushed in to get him like a shrew, only to be ridiculed by those women, despised by his friends, and even kicked out by security.</p><p>To Elliott, whatever I did was wrong.</p><p>I didn&#x27;t understand it in the past. But now, I felt quite calm.</p><p>Paige wanted to rush in to teach Elliott a lesson, but I stopped her and shook my head.</p><p>I said, &quot;Paige, let him be. He could find women, and I can also get young men. We just do our own thing. It&#x27;s not worth being angry with him!&quot;</p><p>After drinking, I talked more loudly. And with the hatred, I inevitably spoke with gritted teeth.</p><p>I was about to leave with Paige. Unexpectedly, someone behind me suddenly stopped me.</p><p>&quot;Madeline, since when did you become so thoughtful? Elliott is there. Aren&#x27;t you going to come in and meet us?&quot;</p><p>I found the voice familiar. It was Quinn.</p><p>It was a small world. I wanted to leave quietly. However, he stopped me and opened the box&#x27;s door.</p><p>At that moment, everyone in their box saw me. Soon, Elliott&#x27;s cold voice sounded.</p><p>&quot;Madeline, come in!&quot;</p><p>He still had that emotionless and commanding tone.</p><p>I turned my head and rested my eyes on Elliott in the center of the box.</p><p>Everyone in the box was dressed casually except for Elliott, who was in a dark suit. He sat there with a solemn look. I could feel the pressure even from a distance.</p><p>I saw the woman beside him acting coquettishly. She was Sylvia Hart, a minor actress who played roles in several popular TV series. She was Elliott&#x27;s type. They had been spending a lot of time together recently. Only I knew she was one of the women Elliott used as a cover-up during our six years of marriage.</p><p>The only woman he always loved was Giselle. But back then, I wasted too much energy on these women and made myself miserable. But I ignored Giselle.</p><p>&quot;Anything I can help?&quot;</p><p>I walked towards Elliott while he frowned again and mocked, &quot;Madeline, who allowed you to drink?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Myself,&quot; I replied nonchalantly.</p><p>Elliott&#x27;s scowl deepened, anger flaring. </p><p>He glared at me, his words icy. &quot;How dare you dress so provocatively and drink at the club? Forgot you&#x27;re married?&quot; </p><p>He had the nerve to ask, parading around with another woman himself. </p><p>A sudden surge of bravery had me leaning in, arms resting on the couch beside him. Our faces, now mere inches apart. </p><p>Taken aback, Elliott recoiled. Our eyes locked. I could see every pore on his face. </p><p>I boldly breathed on him, flashing a bright smile. &quot;And what about you? Drinking here with another woman, letting paparazzi track you. Ever consider you&#x27;re married, too?&quot;</p><div class="pagination"><a href="5.html">« Prev</a><a href="7.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
