I will contact you again once I reach Ruini and get off the highway!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I said this, she immediately let out a frustrated and sinister laugh on the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were even negotiating terms with me at this point! It seems like you really don't care about Quinn's life, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mentioned Quinn, and I immediately felt a wave of panic. I immediately shouted into the phone, "It's been a whole night, and I still don't know how Quinn is doing now! If you want to know my license plate number, then you need to video call me now. I have to see with my own eyes that he is still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not as stupid as I thought," the woman laughed coldly on the other end of the phone, "Fine, I agree to let you see him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman hung up the phone after she finished speaking, and shortly afterward, she made a video call to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately answered the phone, and as soon as the video call connected, the first thing I saw was a desolate-looking forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video was a bit shaky, probably because the woman was walking while holding her phone. After a short while, she aimed the camera of her phone at a dark wooden cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could vaguely see a person in the wooden cage, his arms still tied and his head forced out of the cage, hanging down. I couldn't see his face clearly, but I could vaguely tell that he looked like a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman walked over and directly grabbed his hair, revealing half of the man's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, imitate the sound of a pig a few times for your friend to hear, so she doesn't think you're dead and won't come to give you money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's tone was extremely insulting. After saying that, she deliberately slapped the man's face hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was obviously tortured to the brink of death. After she slapped him like that, the man screamed in pain, a sound that made me tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at the screen with wide eyes, unable to breathe due to sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could hardly believe that the man, who was now on the verge of death, was the same charming Quinn I remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively felt that perhaps all of this might just be a scam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Quinn's phone has remained disconnected until now. I also tried to contact Carole, but she said she couldn't reach Quinn either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the current situation, I dare not inform Carole about the situation at all. I know Carole's personality, and if she knew about Quinn's treatment, she would definitely impulsively come to the Norch City border.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the current situation is not something she can solve with a momentary impulse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dehan had also repeatedly reminded me that the situation at the border was far more complex than we had imagined. Before we had any knowledge of their backgrounds, we must not let more people know about this matter. Otherwise, not only would they likely be unable to help us, but more people could also be put in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn! Quinn! Is it really you? If it's you, nod your head right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched the man in the video and couldn't help but shout loudly, hoping that he could hear my words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the man in the video could react, the woman had already abruptly ended the video call. Afterward, she called me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have seen him already, now tell me your license plate number! Otherwise, I have a thousand ways to torment Quinn, I guarantee that any of them will leave a lasting memory on him!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="732.html">« Prev</a><a href="734.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
