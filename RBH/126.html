I can doubt any other woman, but Giselle, how could I not doubt her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was your dream lover, you know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started feeling again that everything I did was wrong, and that anything I said was also wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My reason reminded me that I acted impulsively tonight and lost control. I asked questions I shouldn't have asked, and I shattered the peace I had been trying to maintain during this period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said things I shouldn't have said. However, I am just an ordinary person, and as long as I care about him, I cannot help but care if he likes other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, how much have I liked you all these years? I liked you to the point where I knew what you loved to eat, I knew what you enjoyed doing, I was well aware of every stage of your life, and even a single glance or gesture from you, I knew what you were thinking and how you would act. So, how could I not know what kind of woman you liked?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I covered the position of my heart, looked at him, and couldn't help but mutter to myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I finished saying these words, my entire soul instantly plunged into complete disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was I doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does someone who doesn't care about me show their true feelings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Doing this, I wouldn't get his attention at all. It would only make him look down on me even more. What am I doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, I found that my emotions once again walked on the edge of losing control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I, I absolutely couldn't go on like this anymore. If I continued to stay with Elliott, I was afraid I would say more things that I would regret, exposing more of my inner feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, my whole being would be seen through by him again, then despised by him, and mercilessly abandoned by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I thought about these things, I, like a refugee fleeing in panic from a fire scene, swiftly pushed open the car door without any hesitation and jumped out of his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, damn it! What were you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's roar came from inside the car, and at the same time, I heard the sound of the car door closing behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't look back, as soon as Ijumped out ofthe car, I ran forward like crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bag that contained all the heartbreaking memories of my past life seemed to have been torn open by someone, creating a huge hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I ran while those shattered memories fell, and tears blurred my eyes without me knowing when.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know when I lost my high heels on my feet, and I ran forward desperately like a refugee escaping from death, regardless of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the wind whistling behind could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel that Elliott chased me for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, perhaps he thought I was too crazy, or perhaps he thought chasing after me was beneath his status, or perhaps, I simply wasn't that important to him in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not catch up with me anymore, behind me, only the fierce wind blew across this empty road.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="125.html">« Prev</a><a href="127.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
