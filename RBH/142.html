Therefore, in no time, I got along well with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I accompanied them to take photos, laughed and joked with them. They took the opportunity to invite me to join their party in the evening. I thought to myself that I would be staying in Louis City for another day anyway, so I happily agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam quickly beautified our group photo and sent it to me. Being surrounded by so many handsome guys for the first time, I couldn't contain my excitement and immediately posted the photo on Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige saw my Instagram post, immediately liked it, and started a commotion in the comments, asking me to share her location so she could come over and hang out with me right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I replied to her with a smile that I would be partying with handsome guys in the evening. Being infatuated as she always was, upon hearing me say that, she immediately messaged me privately, asking me to send her my location. She rushed over right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy still has the same look of being unable to walk when he sees a handsome guy, just like a thousand years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I had never experienced her happiness, but now that I find myself surrounded by these handsome guys, I truly understand that the happiness Paige used to advocate for is indeed real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love is not important at all, and Elliott is not important at all either. It's better to enjoy life while we are young, and do whatever makes us happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I increasingly feel that I made the right decision to step out and work. My mood is as bright as flowers, and I have completely forgotten about Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just as I was experiencing the most delightful joy in this world, suddenly, someone walked up to me and whispered, "Ms. Mayers, there is someone waiting for you in the alley ahead, asking you to come over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who?" I looked at the person in front of me with confusion. He had a work ID and was a staff member of my crew, so he shouldn't have the audacity to deceive me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He didn't say who it was, he said you would know if you go there," the other person said, pointing to the alley ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alley was reconstructed by the film and television city based on the ancient classical period. It looked quiet and deep, but today there are so many people on the scene, and we are also in the film and television city, so I am not worried about encountering any accidents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I instinctively walked towards that alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked on the cobblestone road with my high heels, making a crisp "thud thud" sound. The sky, painted in a light blue color, added a classical atmosphere to this alley. Step by step, I walked forward, and involuntarily, a poem came to mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was getting a little lost in my thoughts, suddenly, a hand hooked around my neck from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to let out a scream, but unexpectedly, the other person covered my mouth directly and immediately pressed me against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I get kidnapped again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't I have such bad luck?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so shocked that my eyes widened, my blood froze, and my heart instantly jumped to my throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, a very familiar and delicate scent of perfume wafted over, instantly making my nerves tense up.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="141.html">« Prev</a><a href="143.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
