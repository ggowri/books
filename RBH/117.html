Young couples should be together wherever they go. That's what being a couple means. Today, I had the servant prepare a big table of food, and you two will have dinner with us here. After dinner, I'll have Elliott play basketball with Jasper. I'll take you to the orchard behind. My fruit trees have produced a lot of fruits this year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Laura. By the way, I also brought a gift for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Laura's words, I quickly took out a jewelry box from my bag, inside of which was a purple crystal ornament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have learned about Laura's preferences through Sean. She liked crystals and also liked the color purple. And this ornament was bought by me at a high price several years ago when I traveled to Tepit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This ornament was bought by me in Tepit. Take a look and see where it would be suitable to place it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura understood all of this. As soon as she saw this transparent purple crystal ornament, she knew that it was valuable. She immediately smiled even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, this is great. I have been looking for such a decoration recently. I didn't expect it to be so coincidental that you gave it to me. Madeline, you have been giving me things lately. I feel embarrassed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, gifts are the most touching. Even though Laura has everything, occasionally giving her a gift that makes her happy is still very useful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, we were family. It was my duty to treat you well. Don't feel embarrassed. As long as you like it, I will buy it for you in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I was already very good at saying these polite words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Laura immediately showed a happy smile. For some reason, without thinking, she suddenly took off the expensive pearl necklace from her neck and placed it directly into my hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I am delighted to see how kind you have been to me. This pearl necklace was given to me by Jasper back then. I am giving this necklace to you. It goes perfectly with the dress you are wearing today. Come, let me put it on for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are hardly any pearl necklaces of such high quality available on the market now. Laura's necklace can be considered a priceless treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect her to generously give me this necklace and personally put it on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, this is too valuable. I cannot accept it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was not greedy. Especially when I thought about leaving Elliott in the future, I felt that I should not accept such a valuable gift. So, I quickly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I didn't expect Laura to insist on putting it on me. And Elliott didn't know when he had walked up to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually praised, "You wear it. It looks good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right? This is what your father gave me back then. Although your dad was quite a playboy when he was young, he gave me a lot of jewelry. Don't be stingy with your wife. You need to be generous, so that a woman will always stay with you, you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura couldn't help but educate Elliott again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, I had never seen Laura educating Elliott in such a way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, I spoke and acted poorly, to the extent that every family gathering turned into a criticism session directed at me. Laura also used these aggressive words against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, what surprises me is that Laura was just as impactful when she was teaching Elliott. And Laura, unexpectedly, treats me so well that I can't help but want to give her a kiss.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="116.html">« Prev</a><a href="118.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
