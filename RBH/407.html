Crouching, I checked the peephole again, but the view remained empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was someone deliberately toying with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My instinct urged me to open the door and investigate further, but I hesitated, realizing I was alone and vulnerable.
