Shouldn't we go check on her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched as Laura was escorted away by a group of people, feeling somewhat guilty deep down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She'll be fine. There are doctors around, nothing to worry about," Quinn reassured me, pulling me without hesitation towards the exit of the yacht.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, I hurried home to change clothes and quickly returned to the office at the Glory Group. Just as I sat down to start working, I received a call from Elliott, his tone filled with interrogation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, where were you last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone irritated me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? What does it matter to you where I was?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone grew even more displeased. "Were you with Quinn last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Ha! He is just my ex-husband. What does it matter to him who I'm with? Why does he have the right to question me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, any problem with that? It's perfectly normal. We're already divorced, I can be with whomever I want," I replied coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I can't believe you even attended the socialite party last night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone turned angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but chuckle, "So what if I attended? Your mom was there too. Is it abnormal for me to go if she went? You're being overly broad in your oversight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott raised his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you mention my mom! Her blood pressure rose because of your antics, and now she's receiving treatment at Bryant Hospital! I never thought you'd stoop so low. You've truly disappointed me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Me? Low?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I did, it's nothing compared to their Bryant family's antics, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected Elliott to call and interrogate me so early. It made me furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her blood pressure rose, and so did mine! Elliott, I beg you and your mom, curb your curiosity about my life. Stop disturbing my present life. You have no right or qualification to interfere. We're divorced!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I angrily spoke into the phone before hanging up, shaking with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the divorce, I found myself increasingly disliking Elliott and his family. I felt more and more that all those years I spent with him were a waste of effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam pushed the door open and walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me still fuming, he was startled and cautiously approached, asking, "Madeline, are you okay? Who made you angry so early?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing, what do you need from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still angry, so my tone came out a bit irritated as I glanced at Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam shivered in fear, quickly placing a bag of snacks he had prepared for me on my desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eating sweets can improve your mood, Madeline. Have some cakes to calm down. Although there is something I need to report to you, if you're not in a good mood now, I can come back later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was perspicacious. He wanted to slip away when he sensed my bad mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his cautious and careful demeanor amused me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was always worried I'd go hungry, often preparing various snacks for me. Such thoughtful gestures were truly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pretending to be angry, I glared at him. "Alright, let's continue working. What's the matter?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="582.html">« Prev</a><a href="584.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
