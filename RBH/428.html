I'm Madeline. 'Do Not Love' has been a success thanks to the collaboration with your network, so I've invited you to dinner today. I'm glad you could join us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, you're too kind. With 'Do Not Love' performing so well in the ratings, we're pretty pleased. In today's meeting, we discussed how unexpectedly popular the show has become. It's truly beyond anyone's imagination. At this rate, it's set to be the top show at next year's Annual TV Drama Awards. Your choice of scripts is remarkably astute. Looks like we'll have many more opportunities to work together in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rickson, a seasoned executive in the entertainment industry, conveyed a wealth of information in just a few sentences, which delighted me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after finishing his speech, he calmly continued to hold my hand, his eyes unabashedly roaming over me. His blatant opportunism made me highly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, I was well aware that despite his questionable morals, the resources he controlled were beyond the reach of most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's precisely why he was so confident. He knew full well I was a top executive at Glory Group, yet he took advantage of me anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I pretended to brush my hair back, I quickly withdrew my hand from his. With a slight smile, I picked up the glass from the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Then here's to you. I'm counting on your continued support."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem. Ms. Mayers, not only are you young and beautiful, but it's also evident that you're competent. You're incomparable to those girls who only have pretty faces. To be frank, what I admire most is mature professional women like you. Tonight, we meet at last, so why not stay until we're both drunk? What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rickson understood immediately, lifting his glass from the table for a hearty clink against mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I had come alone tonight, I was fully prepared. Knowing his fondness for liquor and his greedy, lustful ways, I had arranged for top-notch cuisine and the finest wines for the evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I engaged in polite conversation with Rickson for a long time. We toasted each other, gradually steering the conversation deeper. From the initial pleasantries, I slowly shifted towards the topics I truly cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rickson drank more, bolstered by the privacy of our room, he became bolder. Out of nowhere, he placed his hand on my shoulder. Leaning in as if to whisper a secret, he purposefully drew me closer, his fingers kneading my shoulder, his tone becoming more overt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, to be honest, I like your straightforward personality. From today on, you've been like a sister to me. In the world of film and TV, just tell me whenever you need help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath, heavy with alcohol, washed over my face. His drunken demeanor triggered a strong sense of physical discomfort in me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all the groundwork I laid tonight, I was just waiting for him to say that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately dropped my fork to the floor and pretended to bend over to pick it up, cleverly dodging his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then I said, "Since you put it that way, you are my brother from now on. To be honest, my visit today was not only to get to know you but also to discuss something that closely concerns you. I thought it best to inform you sooner rather than later. I'd hate for you to fall into someone else's trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked him in the eyes, feigning utmost sincerity. My suddenly serious demeanor seemed to make him realize something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He awkwardly withdrew his hand, his face marked by confusion and bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it that you're making sound so severe?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="427.html">« Prev</a><a href="429.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
