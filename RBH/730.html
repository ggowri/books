Who are you, and why are you treating us like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I desperately tried to control my inner excitement and shouted loudly into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't matter who I was, what matters is that you offended me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman on the phone emitted a sinister and terrifying laughter, and her words confirmed that all of my guesses were correct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seem</span><span>ed</span><span> that I really offended someone, and Quinn was really kidnapped because of being involved with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly lost my composure and couldn't control my emotions as I shouted into the phone, "Since you're so greedy for ten million dollars, you better tell me exactly how I offended you. If I offended you, then you should seek revenge on me. Why did you have to kidnap my friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You provoked something you shouldn't have, so you should bear the consequences. As for Quinn, it was his own choice to come and provoke us, you can't blame us. I don't have time to waste on useless talk with you. Be at Ruini Bus Station tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 sharp. I will call you, and you must do as I say. Remember, you must come alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! I was in the late stage of pregnancy, and I simply didn't have the strength to go alone! If you want me to prepare ten million dollars in cash, I can do it, but I must bring someone with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I figured that since they were asking for so much money, they must really want to get such a large sum of money. So, I took the opportunity to negotiate with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You could only come alone, not allowed to bring anyone, </span><span>or </span><span>you are not qualified to negotiate terms with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I really couldn't go alone, and besides, I couldn't possibly bring so much cash!" I insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I was getting so anxious that I was on the verge of losing control, I knew better than anyone how dangerous Ruini really was, and this group of people were no good either. Therefore, no matter what, I had to find a way to increase my chances of winning and not let them have complete control over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, under my repeated insistence, she hesitated for a moment, as if discussing something with others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she finally relented a little. "Alright, we allow you to bring one person along, and, you can only bring a female."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this sentence, she immediately hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the words spoken by the woman on the phone, Jane immediately said, "Ms. Mayers, let me accompany you! I had studied boxing for a few years before, so </span><span>if someone approaches you, I can at least protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words surprised me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only been working at the company for about three months, and she had been working diligently and rarely speaking since she started. Besides work, there was no other interaction between her and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to face such an extreme danger, and I didn't expect that she would volunteer to accompany me on the adventure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I touched her shoulder with some emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you very much for your kindness, but the situation this time was definitely dangerous. If you had accompanied me, in case we encountered danger..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't finished speaking yet, but she interrupted me directly. She looked at me with a determined and decisive gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know this would be very dangerous, so I cannot let you, being pregnant, go alone recklessly. Besides, this time the executive team is traveling together, and apart from me, the only other female is the CFO, who is older and not suitable to accompany you. Let me go with you, Ms. Mayers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that a friend in need was a friend indeed. Jane volunteered herself to face the danger with me, which made me appreciate this petite yet determined woman even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Marcus returned with the others from Amber Snow Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That evening, we discussed the current situation in Jane's room. Just when we were at a loss, Marcus suddenly slapped his forehead, as if he had thought of something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I almost forgot about him! I have a comrade named Dehan Rethe, who is currently leading a team on official duties in the border area of Norch City! I will contact him right away</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>M</span><span>aybe we can get some assistance from him!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="729.html">« Prev</a><a href="731.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
