In his past life, Elliott had also been kidnapped in Norch City. On the brink of death, it was Giselle who saved him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he too has been in a car accident. Only this time, it's unclear who will be his savior.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could he suddenly be in a car accident?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, I couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, all I know is that he's still in critical care."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn frowned, his eyes still reflecting concern for Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's in a different world now, Madeline. I heard about his accident, there's a woman who's been by his side all along. He won't lack for care, you don't need to worry about him anymore. You nearly died yourself, you should focus on your own well-being and the baby. Once you're a bit better, we'll take you to see the baby. He's so tiny, with skin as white and soft as snow. We want him to have a peaceful life, so Paige and I decided to name him Noah. What do you think of this nickname?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that I was still curious about Elliott's situation, Fiona mistakenly thought I was still worried about him and said to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah's a solid name, symbolizing tranquility. After surviving this unexpected ordeal, we hope for a future of peace and happiness for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I chuckled and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pretty good, I'm also eager to see Noah soon. By the way, have you guys reached out to my parents?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Discussing Noah's name, I suddenly thought of my parents and quickly asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Austin and Lily had been at the hospital non-stop. It took a lot of persuasion before they agreed to go home and rest. They were there for Noah's birth, and they were overjoyed. They declared that this was a child of the Mayers family. They even named the baby Lucas Mayers, hoping he would bring light into our lives."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said to me with a laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, while I was out cold, my folks and best buds had already picked out a first and nickname for the baby.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucas... such an elegant name. My folks must have put a lot of thought into it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrival of a new life is a joyous occasion for everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment children were mentioned, the previously somber atmosphere instantly lightened up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was happily discussing around the topic of Lucas. Paige even told me that she had prepared everything that Lucas would need after his birth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as she spoke, tears began to stream down her face. Suddenly, she choked out, "If Miky had been born, he would have been a hundred days old by now, wouldn't he?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere once again grew heavy. Seeing this, Fiona quickly patted her shoulder:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let go of the past. You're still young, there will be chances for more babies in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, when you find someone better, Miky will surely come back for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly offered my comfort as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miky probably won't come looking for me anymore. Ever since I had the miscarriage, my periods have been all over the place. Recently, they even found a cyst in my uterus. Miky must think I'm heartless. I could already picture him, yet I insisted on taking him out of this world. Someone like me doesn't deserve to be a mother again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paige spoke, she couldn't help but break down, hiding her tears behind her hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, the atmosphere, which had been filled with joy just moments ago, instantly turned incredibly tense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paige clutching her face, crying her heart out, I understood her better than anyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who've walked in the shoes of a mother can truly comprehend the journey of ten months of pregnancy. Watching your baby evolve from a tiny embryo into a full-fledged fetus is a process that's as taxing as it is joyous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If given a choice, no one would willingly rob a child of their life. Because for a mother, her child is her very life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if a child's first experience in this world isn't joy, but rather the quarrels and betrayals of their parents, it's far too cruel for a newborn.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="751.html">« Prev</a><a href="753.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
