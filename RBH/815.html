Despite having eaten next to nothing, he still gulped down the entire glass of hard liquor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone on the scene couldn't help but burst into applause for him. I too, couldn't resist joining in, clapping and laughing along.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jane brought over a steaming hot plate of spaghetti.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After downing his drink, Quinn immediately started wolfing down his pasta.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this pastoral idyll, he savors his pasta and wine with a hearty gusto.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching him devour his spaghetti, I felt an inexplicable sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, seeing someone with a good appetite eating can really lift one's spirits.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After polishing off his noodles, Quinn dove back into a drinking contest with Marcus. The atmosphere lightened instantly, and their colleagues loosened up. Everyone joined in the drinking spree.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and I stood off to the side, watching and commenting, occasionally throwing in a few jabs for good measure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a good while, Jane took a sweeping glance around, then whispered to me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Mr. Bryant, Mrs. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a document or text to revise, I'm unable to assist. Could you please provide the text you'd like me to work on?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't he just behind me a moment ago?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane's question caught me off guard. I quickly scanned the room, and sure enough, Elliott was nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't he just come in? I thought he was right behind me all along&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I confess, although it wasn't my intention to ignore him, it seems I truly did overlook him completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, Elliott's weight in my heart is surprisingly light... Even I find this feeling unexpected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stepped out into the yard, scanning my surroundings in a full circle, but there was no sign of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought he had left, only to find his car still parked. However, as I approached, all I saw was Barry, sitting alone in the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, why are you alone? Where's Mr. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't he out there in the yard with you guys?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Barry asked me in a peculiar way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, there's no one in the yard. Strange, where could he have gone?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I muttered in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the news, Barry immediately hopped out of the car. He quickly scanned his surroundings, then pointed towards a spot not too far away:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's smoking over there, could it be Mr. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the direction of his pointed finger, I instantly spotted a flickering ember in the corner not too far away. It seemed like someone was smoking there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be him. There's no one else here but him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of relief washed over me, and I found myself drawn towards that direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, Mr. Bryant didn't come to Norch City for business this time around. Truth be told, he simply couldn't bear to be away from you. Even in his sleep on the journey here, he was calling out your name&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Barry chimed in from behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused in my tracks. I knew Barry had something to spill.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I didn't respond to him. Instead, I headed straight for that corner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, I spotted a lone silhouette leaning against the base of a wall. His tall figure slanted against the solid structure. In his hand, he toyed with a lighter, its flickering flame casting an intermittent glow on his face. A layer of frost masked his handsome features.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his other hand hung naturally, pinching a cigarette. From a distance, I could smell the strong scent of tobacco wafting towards me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he had been standing here alone, puffing on his cigarette for quite some time.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="814.html">« Prev</a><a href="816.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
