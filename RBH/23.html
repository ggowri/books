It turned out it was for Sylvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry had nothing to do with it. I intruded on my own. Is it too much for me to come and find my husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I scanned the private room and when I noticed that there were only him and Sylvia inside, I smiled and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the copyright holder had not yet arrived, so I came just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I thought you had made some progress recently, but I didn't expect you to come looking for trouble again. I have important things to discuss tonight, so I want you to leave immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me with cold eyes and spoke in a disgusted tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might still think that I, as in the past, came to argue with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, this time, he was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't it be more appropriate to bring your wife to discuss business? Don't worry. I'll sit beside you to assist when you're working."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled indifferently, paying no attention to his attitude of wanting to kick me out. I walked over and sat directly beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, why is she here again? We were supposed to discuss the script tonight, but what does a housewife know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia's face darkened the moment I walked in. Seeing me sit down, she immediately took Elliott's hand in front of me and mocked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sylvia, you were wrong. I was not a housewife, but the wife of a rich and powerful family that even actresses like you couldn't become."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head and looked straight at Sylvia, smiling provocatively as I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I realized that Giselle was my enemy, I didn't even bother to pay attention to insignificant people like Sylvia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was just mocking her casually, after all, I would still face such situations in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Sylvia relied on Elliott's support and didn't pay any attention to me. However, now I casually hit her pain point with just a few words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, she... she has gone too far! It was too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can leave if you think I'm going too far," I smiled faintly. "Ms. Hart, you surely must be aware that my husband is married, right? What were you trying to do by holding my husband's hand in front of me? My in-laws may not be willing to accept your dark past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My purpose here tonight was to disrupt their cooperation, so now, I hope the atmosphere would become as awkward as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I used to be somewhat wary of speaking out in front of Elliott. Now, I had no scruples, and Sylvia was naturally angered by me, her face darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She perhaps knew some tactics, but she still cared about her image in front of Elliott and naturally couldn't say anything offensive. Sylvia got angry and cried again at my continued humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this moment, the copyright holder had already arrived at the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sylvia, get back to the car and calm down first, then touch up your makeup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said to Sylvia with a cold face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sylvia still looked at me resentfully, wishing that Elliott would kick me out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott coldly looked at her, probably thinking that she was being improper, and then commanded again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="22.html">« Prev</a><a href="24.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
