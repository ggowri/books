You dare to lecture me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was still stubbornly arguing her point.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My daughter is right, the whole debacle with the Bryant family was public knowledge. Madeline was the victim, she didn't do anything wrong. Now that Madeline is about to get engaged to my son, I suggest you back off."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole's mom spoke with a gentle tone, yet her words carried a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura glanced at Carole and her mother, then turned her gaze to me, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just wanted to make sure, that's all. Since you all insist that the child isn't Elliott's, I'll take your word for it this time. But Madeline, you better not be lying to me. If I find out that this child is Elliott's, let me make this clear in advance, the child must return to the Bryant family!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Laura took off with her bodyguard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching them leave, I finally let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got it tough, Madeline. Who knows what you owed the Bryant family in a past life?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole's mom took my hand, speaking with tender care.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a past life...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my past life, I was done even dirtier by the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a bitter smile, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie, Carole, what brings you two here today?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ever since my mom laid eyes on your little Noah that day, she hasn't been able to get him out of her mind, saying he's just too adorable. Today, she insisted that I bring her over to see Noah. Madeline, may we come in?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole joked on purpose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why wouldn't I let you in? Come on in, please do."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly swung the door open, ushering the mother and daughter inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My folks were always in the living room, keeping an eye on everything happening outside through the surveillance. So, when they saw the mother and daughter walk in, they were overjoyed. They immediately prepared an assortment of snacks and fruits, ready to welcome them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a bit of chit-chat in the living room, everyone made a beeline for the nursery to check on Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah had just woken up, lying in his crib, his big eyes darting around curiously. He was simply too adorable for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone couldn't help but want to hug him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, he was passed from one set of arms to another, each person reluctant to let him go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom and Carole's mom were jostling to hold Noah, chatting away in a harmonious scene.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole pulled me into the hallway outside the nursery, whispering to me:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, have you given it any thought? The whole family is hoping you and Quinn will get engaged soon. That way, my mom can help you take care of Noah, and your parents won't have to work so hard."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole is clearly playing the "matchmaker" here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I retorted with a grin:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carole, why are you pushing us to get engaged when you're not in a rush yourself? You're even two years older than Quinn."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was only joking, but to my surprise, Carole suddenly let out a sigh and said, with a profound undertone:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can wait, but Quinn might not have the time.
