I apologize to you, and I hope you won't hold a grudge, considering our striking resemblance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Lisa deliberately flashed her freshly manicured hand. Her nails, painted a vivid red, eerily resembled the blood-stained claws of a fox, sending an inexplicable shiver down my spine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you and Lisa really are two peas in a pod. The first time I saw her, I almost mistook her for you. Apart from the voice, you two are like two sides of the same coin."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile finally graced Elliott's face. In front of Lisa, he wrapped his arm around my waist. He looked at me with eyes full of love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I beg to differ. Elliott, can't you tell the difference between Ms. Fox and me?" I asked, my voice icy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm well aware that Lisa and I bear a striking resemblance to each other. However, I'm not exactly fond of this similarity. In fact, I find it somewhat offensive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it's because Lisa always gives me a peculiar vibe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I can tell the difference."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott picked up on the annoyance in my tone, immediately responding. He then gently squeezed my waist, as if to soothe me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to speak, my brows furrowed, when Lisa beat me to it. "I share the same sentiment with Ms. Mayers. I once thought I was unique, never expecting that there would be someone in this world who looks like me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott declared, "To me, Madeline is one of a kind. I can't see any other woman but her in my eyes."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott rarely made such emotional declarations in public.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what's more, he said it right in front of a woman who clearly had feelings for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shift, it caught me off guard. I couldn't help but glance up at him, a smile playing on my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at Lisa, it was clear she was upset. She was staring at Elliott, her eyes brimming with hurt that even I couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Lisa wasn't just skilled in medicine, she was also a master of seduction. No man could resist her captivating gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott's gaze finally landed on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've had a taste of Mr. Bryant's devotion today. I'm a bit peckish, I'll grab something to eat first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa quickly made up an excuse, then turned and hurried away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as though she wiped her eyes with her hand as she turned away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How long has she known Elliott?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I'm overthinking it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping back to reality, I found Elliott's hand suddenly shifting upwards, forcing my head onto his shoulder. He whispered softly, "Sleep a bit more. I'll wake you when it's time to board."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't really tired anymore, but to avoid further interaction with Elliott, I'd rather feign sleep to dodge the awkwardness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was an unmistakably familiar scent on Elliott's shoulder, broad and comforting enough that I found myself unconsciously drifting off to sleep against it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, it was finally time to board the plane.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott roused me, taking my hand and leading me into the cabin. Once again, he had booked first class, and just like last time, we sat side by side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there was Lisa, sitting right behind us.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="827.html">« Prev</a><a href="829.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
