The Bryant family has only had one child per generation for three generations</span><span> in a row</span><span>. If Noah becomes the heir of the Bryant family, combined with the power of the Glory Group, he will surely achieve great things in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige </span><span>was convinced by Fiona's words. She nodded thoughtfully and then turned to me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the </span><span>thing</span><span> is what Madeline thinks</span><span> about it</span><span>. Madeline, what are your thoughts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I picked up the coffee on the table, took a sip, rested my chin on my hand, and pondered for a moment before speaking slowly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still need to think it over. Noah is my parents' treasure right now. If the Bryant family takes him back, my parents will be heartbroken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the other hand, even though the Quinn family treats you well, Noah isn't their biological child. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they are kind to Noah, if you marry Quinn Woods, Noah might be deeply affected when he learns the truth as he grows up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline, some things have far-reaching consequences. I hope you think it through carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my hesitation, Fiona patted my shoulder and spoke earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had come to them for advice, hoping for an answer, but in the end, I realized that the answer had to come from me. All they could offer were suggestions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After talking with them for half the day, my head was buzzing with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I left the caf&eacute;, it was already </span><span>nigh</span><span>t</span><span>fall</span><span>. Just as I got into my car to drive home, my mom</span><span> called</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom's voice on the phone was very unhappy:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, where have you been?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I was just </span><span>hanging</span><span> with Fiona and </span><span>Paige</span><span>. What's wrong? Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Come</span><span> home </span><span>now</span><span>! </span><span>Elliott</span><span> somehow found our </span><span>place</span><span> and is now refusing to leave from our doorstep! </span><span>C</span><span>ome back and deal with this yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom is extremely upset with </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. She yelled into the phone and then abruptly hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> won't leave from my doorstep?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems he has found out our address.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran through me. I put away my phone and quickly drove straight home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I parked in front of my house, I saw </span><span>Elliott</span><span> standing there with a </span><span>bunch</span><span> of carnations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him were various gifts, all wrapped in high-end packaging, clearly very expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were bags with LV and Herm&egrave;s logos, obviously limited edition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's the rainy season, and the weather hasn't been great. When I arrived, the sky was dark and it was drizzling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> wasn't even using an umbrella. He stood there</span><span> at my doorstep,</span><span> holding the flowers</span><span> with</span><span> one hand in his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked sincere, like he was seeking forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My house's door was tightly shut, but when I got out of the car, I saw my mom peeking through a corner of the curtain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she noticed me looking at her, she angrily shut the curtain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked up and patted </span><span>Elliott</span><span> on the shoulder from behind:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, how did you find my house? How long have you been standing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> turned around quickly when he heard my voice. His deep eyes were glistening with moisture, and he looked very gentle:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're back, Madeline. I </span><span>know</span><span> everything now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was low and seemed to carry a hint of mist, making the surrounding air feel heavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems he really did find out everything after </span><span>he&rsquo;s</span><span> back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, my tone calm:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you already </span><span>found out</span><span> everything, you should know that there's no turning back for me. My parents won't forgive you either. You're still not </span><span>recovered</span><span>, so don't stand in the rain. Go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> took a deep breath and shook his head:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to go inside and apologize to your parents in person. If you don't let me in, I'll stand here. It makes me feel </span><span>a little </span><span>better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was as stubborn as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents won't let you in, and it's raining. Your clothes are soaked. If you keep standing here, you'll get sick."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, a bit anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't matter. Compared to the pain </span><span>you once had</span><span>, this is nothing. Madeline, I just want you to </span><span>see</span><span> my resolve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> looked at me with such determination that my heart couldn't help but skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was never like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much he liked something, he would never humble himself to get it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had everything he wanted since childhood. After all, the Bryant family was the most prestigious in all of </span><span>Hoswich</span><span> city, and he was the sole heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, here he was, humbly holding flowers, standing in the rain in front of my tightly shut door, just to seek forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hardened heart began to soften a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back. </span><span>They</span><span> won't see you. If I let you in, they might even cut ties with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing my parents' temperament, I still refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. I'll just stand here. At least standing here, I feel close to you, and my heart is at peace. When I go back to Serenity Villa, your shadow is everywhere, and I can't sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Elliott</span><span> insisted on standing at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the rain getting heavier, I instinctively felt sorry for him and wanted to let him in. </span><span>Suddenly</span><span> my mom suddenly opened the door and yelled at me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline</span><span> Mayers</span><span>, get </span><span>in</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my memory, it had been years since my mom called me by my full name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sudden shout startled me, and I shrank my neck. Knowing she was really angry, I quickly walked into the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I entered the living room, my mom was glaring at me fiercely from the sofa, while my dad sat </span><span>across</span><span> her, letting out a heavy sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad asked coldly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why is he here again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, he..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to say something when my mom, trembling with anger, stood up and pointed at my nose:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how can you forget what he had done to you? Have you forgotten how his family humiliated us? How can you let him find our home? What is he here for now? To beg for forgiveness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom was shaking with rage, and seeing her face turn pale, I felt a pang of discomfort in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a loud thunderclap boomed outside, followed by a massive lightning strike!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="907.html">« Prev</a><a href="909.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
