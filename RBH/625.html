It reminded me of Giselle's unexpected child, and then I remembered that the child had Down syndrome. I couldn't help but glance at the time of this video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the timeline, this celebration took place shortly before Giselle became pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that the child was not a product of artificial insemination, but an unexpected result of her party this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but think, "If that's the case, then this farce, not only is it amazing, but it's even more thrilling than a Hollywood movie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat in front of the computer, feeling excited for a moment, which caused the baby in my belly to kick me several times. Only then did I come to my senses, quickly saved the video, and turned off the computer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to be patient and wait for the right moment to reveal this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was not in a hurry. I would collect these little by little, and when the time was right, I would make Giselle regret doing these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was also discharged from the hospital after a week.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona and I took her back home. Paige had already recovered a lot, and she was also prepared to face the conflicts within her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That morning, as I was driving to work, I suddenly received a call from Grey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, didn't you want to talk to Benjamin about collaboration before? I asked Benjamin last night, but he said he never received your call. So, have you changed </span><span>your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There have been quite a few unexpected things during this period, which have occupied me for a while. So when I received Grey's call, I quickly said to her, "</span><span>Auntie</span><span> Grey, I'm sorry. I have been caught up with some personal matters recently. Can we make it today? I'm available today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see. Benjamin and I were planning to go to a private farm today to attend a BBQ outdoor party. If you have time, come over and we can have fun and chat," Grey said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Grey was indeed a well-rounded socialite, enthusiastic about attending various forms of parties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, just send me the time and location. I'll come straight over," I said to Grey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey readily agreed and quickly sent the information about the party to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I returned to the company to get some matters settled, I went home and changed into a loose and casual white dress. This dress could effectively conceal my baby bump. Additionally, considering the strong outdoor sunlight, I deliberately put on a wide-brimmed sun hat. Then, I drove out and went directly to the farm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was a gathering place for high-end individuals. Although it was a farmhouse, it was very unique and a place that ordinary people simply couldn't enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I parked the car, I walked into the farm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when I had just arrived at the location where the party was being held, and from a distance, I immediately spotted Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura, despite her advanced age, dressed in an extremely exaggerated manner. The bright red dress stood out in the crowd, and her arrogant and exaggerated laughter echoed in every corner of the party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't even approached when I heard her boastfully say, "Hahaha... don't you dare compliment me on being young, I am now a grandmother! In my family, we have a new grandson, who was born weighing 6.6 pounds, very healthy!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="624.html">« Prev</a><a href="626.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
