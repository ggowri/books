If we don't keep tabs on these celebs, who knows what kind of shady stuff they'll pull behind the scenes?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all the hype around films and TV shows these days, celebs were raking in cash, and the industry was booming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why I decided to dive into the scene now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, your work comes with its risks and potential backlash. So, Ken, I was thinking, could you help me track someone?" I got straight to the point.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem. I might not agree to anyone else, but I'll do my best to help you. Tell me, who's the unlucky celeb?" Ken asked, flashing a grin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jezebel. I want every dirty secret on her, and I need you to keep someone on her tail 24/7. Name your price," I replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jezebel? What's got you interested in a rising star like her?" Ken raised an eyebrow, surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got my reasons. Just focus on getting it done, alright?" I dodged the question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No </span><span>problem</span><span>. I'll get my guy on it, and if there's any juicy info, you'll be the first to know. You set the price, just don't waste his time," Ken agreed without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken and I had a good catch-up over grub, reminiscing about the old days. Then we parted ways.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Ken on board, I was sure Jezebel's dirt would come to light soon. Once I had that ammo, the ball would be in my court.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle pushing Jezebel to join the Bryant Group's artist lineup was likely her </span><span>way to </span><span>sneak into the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in this life, I wasn't about to let any of her schemes just slide.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was humming a tune as I made my way to my car when suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I spun around to find Quinn standing there, looking all mysterious as usual.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he ditched his usual laid-back style for a snazzy navy blue suit. It was sharp, making him look even taller and more imposing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he'd slicked back his hair, giving his features a whole new level of sophistication. I barely recognized him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he smelled good, too. Really good. His cologne had classy, ocean-fresh scent that was just... next level.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here, Quinn?" I blurted out, caught off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>My p</span><span>arents dragged me into some cocktail party nearby. </span><span>I p</span><span>arked my car and saw you chatting with some dude. What's the deal? Who's the guy?" Quinn's playful tone cut through the seriousness of his suit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just an old friend I bumped into. </span><span>I H</span><span>aven't seen him in forever, so we're catching up. And look at you, all grown up and hitting up fancy parties now. Weren't these the events you used to hate?" I teased, giving Quinn a once-over.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="389.html">« Prev</a><a href="391.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
