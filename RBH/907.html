We'll tell everyone he's yours and Elliott's. But there's one condition: after you marry, you must have at least two more children with Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper</span><span>&rsquo;s </span><span>words made my head spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's really lowering his pride now, even accepting a child that's not of Bryant blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This doesn't seem like something the Bryant family would do..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head, finding it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True, it wouldn't have been possible before. But now, I have to consider Elliott's health. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked him last night about his feelings toward the child. He said as long as he can </span><span>get back together</span><span> with you, he would treat the child as his own. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only wants you and has no interest in any other woman. He said if he can't marry you, he'd rather stay single for life. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his father, I have to respect his wishes. Besides, I know my son better than anyone. Once he makes up his mind, no one can change it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems Jasper has already told </span><span>Elliott</span><span> </span><span>that I had</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he</span><span> talked to me</span><span> today because he </span><span>knew</span><span> Elliott's </span><span>determination</span><span> and is offering this huge concession to win me over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before </span><span>entering the room</span><span>, I had thought about what he might say, but I didn't expect him to make such a big concession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admit, his words stirred something in me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I can't help but envy </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s selective amnesia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of his amnesia, he can forget all the unpleasant things that happened and the people who don't need to be remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I had to endure it all, bit by bit. The pain of the past life and the experiences of this one are all vivid in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't forget the past. How could I start anew with him without </span><span>feeling burdened</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We</span><span> </span><span>we</span><span>re different, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me being silent, Jasper knew I was conflicted, so he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think it over. When you've made your </span><span>decision</span><span>, give me your answer. Madeline, </span><span>as long as</span><span> you're willing to return to the Bryant family, I promise my wife and I will treat you like our own daughter. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We won't let you suffer any more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't give him a final answer. After chatting with him, I walked out of the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was eavesdropping at the door. When I suddenly opened it, she jumped back in fright, almost stumbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, have you made up your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura quickly straightened up, looking at me expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a straightforward reply, then walked past her and headed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind was a bit muddled. As I walked out of Bryant Hospital, I felt lightheaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I texted Fiona and </span><span>Paige</span><span>, asking them to meet up for afternoon tea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, we met at our usual spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as we met, I told them about the conditions Jasper had offered me today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was stunned in shock:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, really? Did </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s dad actually say that? Madeline, you've really made it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They used to ignore you, but now </span><span>you are beyond their reach</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, why forgive them? Let </span><span>Elliott</span><span> regret it for the rest of his life. It would be best if he stays single forever and the Bryant family ends with</span><span>out an heir</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige </span><span>clapped her hands in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona shot her a glance, "You always stir things up. Do you think Madeline is like you? Madeline has Noah now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah is the Bryant family's only </span><span>inheritor</span><span> now no matter what</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Bryant family is showing such </span><span>concession</span><span>, she has to consider it for Noah's sake. </span><span>Although</span><span> </span><span>Madeline&rsquo;s</span><span> family has assets, Noah should also inherit the Bryant Group's </span><span>big </span><span>wealth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to </span><span>Paige</span><span>, Fiona has always been more rational.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They don't know yet that Noah is actually their </span><span>grandson</span><span>. But Noah looks so much like </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. Once they see him, they'll </span><span>know it</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a sip of coffee, forcing my chaotic thoughts to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't hide the truth forever. Madeline, weren't you angry at the Bryant family for mistreating you? Now that they're willing to make amends with such sincerity, what are you still worried about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona asked me, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>There&rsquo;s no way back for us anymore</span><span>. Some things</span><span> are broken </span><span>forever. If everything could be easily fixed, there wouldn't be so many regrets. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understand Madeline. </span><span>Quinn </span><span>and the Woods family treat her so well. Choosing </span><span>Quinn </span><span>would definitely make her happier than remarrying </span><span>Elliott</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige </span><span>spread her hands, showing her understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn has been nothing but </span><span>nice</span><span> to me. His parents and sister treat Noah and me like family. But I really haven't done anything for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige </span><span>voiced my inner conflict. I admit, my heart still leans towards Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you only feel indebted to Quin</span><span>n</span><span>, like you owe him something. You don't truly love him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline, you need to calm down and listen to your heart. Who do you really love? Who makes you happy? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm practical. I only care about money. If the Bryant family can offer you so much, I think it's worth it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hahaha... 20% of Bryant Group's shares! Do you know how many zeros that is? Oh my God!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona was so excited she was trembling, her money-hungry look making </span><span>Paige </span><span>and me roll our eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige </span><span>pinched her arm hard:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, really? We may not be as wealthy as the Bryant family, but we're not poor either. A bit of money makes you this happy? Have some ambition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What can make you happy if it&rsquo;s not money? Just l</span><span>ook </span><span>around</span><span>, everything runs on money. To me, everything else is an illusion. Only money is real. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone truly cares about you, they'll show it with money. I admit I'm practical. So what? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Madeline hadn't become practical, would the Bryant family offer her so much now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, back then, I was a hopeless romantic, </span><span>abandoning</span><span> everything for </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. I humiliated myself and my family, only to receive endless cold shoulders from the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I've become rational and less willing to compromise. </span><span>But t</span><span>he Bryant family is willing to lower their standards and even spend a fortune to win me back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference is clear only after experiencing it.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="906.html">« Prev</a><a href="908.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
