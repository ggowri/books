She has always liked sticking to me since childhood. I have always treated her like a sister, please don't misunderstand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I, however, laughed maliciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she said she has no blood relation with you. She is Nina's daughter, how can she not have any blood relation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not Nina's biological daughter, but the daughter of Nina's closest friend. Zara's biological mother passed away shortly after giving birth to her and Nina adopted her. For many years, Nina has treated her as her own daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn explained the reason and then gestured for me to go in with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately understood what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a deep breath and followed Quinn inside. As soon as we walked in, I saw a long table placed in the center of the yard. Surrounding the long table were outdoor wicker chairs. The table was already covered with a white lace tablecloth and adorned with many exquisite dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that they planned to have this meal in the yard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this elegant courtyard, paired with such a carefully prepared and delicious meal, indeed gives people a special feeling. Especially, with the arrival of spring, all kinds of flowers in the courtyard have bloomed. The fragrance of the flowers, along with the aroma of the food, truly refreshes the mind and makes one feel relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie Nina, Zara, you guys went back to your country!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Quinn and I entered the door, he greeted first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you finally came back! I missed you so much..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl wearing a white long dress, with a slim figure, immediately stood up. She cheered and jumped up, flying toward me like a bird. She was about to say something, but froze and her voice abruptly stopped when she saw me behind Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zara, let me introduce you. This is my girlfriend, Madeline. Madeline, this is my cousin, Zara."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn immediately introduced himself to the little girl who ran toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The word "girlfriend" made Zara's smile visibly freeze. She paused for a moment, and then the excitement in her voice disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, how come we haven't seen each other for such a short time and you already have a girlfriend? Why didn't you tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't have a chance to tell you yet. Saying it now is the same. Well, everyone is watching us. Let's take our seats quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn indulgently patted Zara's head. Seeing everyone looking at us, he smiled and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not my first time at Quinn's house, so I didn't feel unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one side of the long table, Quinn's parents and Carole had already taken their seats. On the other side of the dining table sat a well-dressed middle-aged couple who appeared to be Auntie Nina and her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn greeted them and then he pulled me to take a seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, just as I was about to sit down, I suddenly felt tripped by something.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="682.html">« Prev</a><a href="684.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
