By the way, what about you and Alexis?" I asked with a curious smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing between us. I'm still waiting for that jerk. Even though it's unlikely for us to be together, he recently mentioned he's planning to return."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona sighed with a hint of resignation in her voice. It was evident she hadn't completely moved on from her previous relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He really is a jerk. I heard his private life was quite complicated during his studies abroad. My classmates even saw him with another girlfriend."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt empathetic towards Fiona's loyalty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While discussing my love life, Fiona seemed to see through everything. Yet, when it came to her own relationships, she was deeply entangled. In truth, Alexis and Fiona were a good match, at least much better than her first love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, he must be lonely overseas. Once he's back, I'll have closure with him. After all, we haven't officially broken up yet," Fiona said rationally.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're too forgiving to accept his chaotic personal life," I said, tapping her head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I am a gynecologist. I've seen many peculiar things and people. Compared to them, my own love life seems insignificant," Fiona chuckled, displaying a broad-minded attitude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexis is truly a great match for you. Young achievers like him are rare. If you miss out on him, you might regret it in the future," I remarked, feeling a pang of regret for Fiona as I admired the tasteful decor of the office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is indeed wonderful, but I can't dive into another relationship before ending one properly. That would be irresponsible of me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Possibly influenced by her profession, Fiona stuck to her principles unwaveringly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't push further, and we found ourselves downstairs without realizing it. At that moment, Rowan suddenly approached us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me, he first looked surprised, then exclaimed with delight, "Madeline, it's you! How come you're visiting our law firm?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I happened to be nearby having lunch, so I thought I'd stop by," I replied with a smile, observing Rowan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to have just returned from the hospital, still carrying the pink lunch box. I shot him a meaningful glance and instinctively asked, "What's this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan chuckled awkwardly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My girlfriend was with her grandpa at the nearby hospital and didn't have time to eat, so I just dropped off some food for her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rowan still referred to Giselle as his girlfriend, indicating that their relationship hadn't reached a breaking point.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden idea in mind, I smiled and remarked, "You're really sweet to your girlfriend, Rowan."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="248.html">« Prev</a><a href="250.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
