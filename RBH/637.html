But both the composition and the atmosphere were mysterious, making one unable to resist speculating about the identity of the female protagonist in these stories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably made deliberate efforts to guide public opinion under these posts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, soon there were many comments below speculating on who the male and female protagonists of these stories were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As curiosity was aroused among everyone, Adam once again released my speech on the Lotus Forum and manipulated public opinion, portraying me as an independent and strong woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These one after another small stories, successfully shattered those embellished stories about Giselle, and everyone quickly understood the truth of the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, everyone understood that my ex-husband was Elliott, Giselle was an immoral mistress, and that child who was valued by the Bryant family was a bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Public opinions instantly erupted into an uproar, and the reputation completely reversed in my favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Mr. Bryant was so blind that he gave up such a good woman and actually got engaged to a mistress!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God, the woman who became beautiful and charming after her divorce, bad men slowly regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it impressive for a mistress to have a son? Truly powerful women don't need to keep a man with children. All mistresses should just die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, comments like these began to fill the entire internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had previously praised Elliott and Giselle's little story are now condemning Giselle as a mistress and mocking Elliott. Everyone in the comments section is subtly criticizing them, saying it was simply not worth the loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle probably never imagined that her intention to create a beautiful story between her and Elliott in advance would be ruined so soon. Things were messed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha... Madeline, I did it! Now I can't wait to see how Giselle will explain this on the day of their engagement!" Adam excitedly showed off his achievements on the internet in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at those comments, I also felt delighted, so I couldn't help but ask with a smile, "You're really amazing. Where did you hear these little stories from? I haven't mentioned them to you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam smiled mysteriously and said, "Some stories were made up, some were guessed. Madeline, how about it? I am good at telling stories, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you write all of these? Adam, I never expected you to have the potential for public relations," I was surprised to find Adam's talent in this area through this incident. I couldn't help but praise him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, when I was in college, I was the editor-in-chief of our school newspaper. Giselle's actions are all things I used to do. With me around, I won't let her have the opportunity to defame you in public opinion!" Adam patted his chest and assured me </span><span>with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I wouldn't give Giselle any chance to defame me. It's not just her, no one should think they can defame me with the support of the masses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, and at the same time, I had already made sufficient preparations, only waiting for their engagement banquet to begin...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="636.html">« Prev</a><a href="638.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
