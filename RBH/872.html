To his surprise, nestled inside was a diamond ring, the size of a pigeon's egg.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood there, dumbfounded, staring at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never saw it coming, him giving me a diamond ring at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he... is he proposing to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, ever since the day you agreed to be with me, I've had this diamond ring specially made for you. My original plan was to wait until Elliott's recovery, then find the perfect moment to propose. But I can't wait any longer. I want to solidify our relationship sooner. Rest assured, I won't pressure you into marrying me before Elliott is fully recovered. But I hope you'll accept this diamond ring. Will you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn also rose to his feet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at me, his gaze soft. After he finished speaking, he prepared to kneel on one knee, cradling the diamond ring.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I panicked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I totally didn't see that coming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could kneel, I reached out, steadying him, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, hold up! Give me a moment to think--"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you hesitating?" Quinn looked at me, puzzled. Then, with a meaningful glance, he asked, "Or is it... you can't let him go?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a clear hint of probing in his tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could sense it, the indifference he once held towards me was now clearly tinged with a fear of loss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I can comprehend.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love, by nature, is selfish and exclusive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once you truly fall in love with someone, how could you bear to see them claimed by another? And how could you ever be willing to share them?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Elliott hadn't lost his memory, I reckon, there's no way Quinn would've been cool with how close Elliott and I were.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's proposing to me now, but all he really wants is for me to make him a promise, just like I did before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I get all these principles.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as I stared at the glittering diamond ring before me, I felt none of the anticipated joy. Despite its worth, despite the blood, sweat, and tears Quinn had poured into it, despite the fact that I had never been proposed to before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you up to, Quinn Woods?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I was caught in my hesitation, a raspy shout suddenly erupted from not too far beside me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a towering shadow charged forward. He forcefully pushed away Quinn's hand that was holding the diamond ring, pulling me behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's actually Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he just install a GPS tracker on me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why does it happen to show up here, of all places?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was taken aback when he saw Elliott. He stood there awkwardly, clutching a massive diamond ring, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline is my girl, Quinn Woods. How many times do I have to tell you before you back off? And to think I considered you a friend!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stared at the diamond ring, understanding the gravity of what just transpired. He looked at Quinn, disappointment etched on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Quinn was about to explain, I hastily silenced him with a look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I feared he might blurt out the truth in a moment of impulse, rendering all the therapy I've been assisting with for Elliott completely pointless.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="871.html">« Prev</a><a href="873.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
