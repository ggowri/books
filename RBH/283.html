Plus, I was completely limp in his embrace, unable to do anything else other than breathe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The private room was saturated with a suggestive allure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As adults, they all grasped the situation in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I narrowed my eyes at them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had never witnessed me in such a state. She recoiled into Philip's arms, patting her chest as she exclaimed, "Oh my, let's leave. We're being quite the disturbance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, I noticed the blush on Paige's face and the distinct red marks on her neck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, those two had abruptly vanished and went off somewhere to flirt with each other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip and Elliott exchanged a glance, sharing a silent understanding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, we'll head back to the hotel. You two enjoy your evening..." Philip said subconsciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't need your concern. Why don't you both leave now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shot Philip a displeased glance, evidently finding him bothersome.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip swiftly grasped his meaning, promptly escorting Paige out and even closing the door to the private room for us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's take a breather. I'm truly exhausted, and I give in, alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their departure, I hastily grabbed a napkin and waved it, conceding defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott gazed at me with a wicked smirk dancing on his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're already tired? That was just foreplay. The real fun begins when we return to the apartment."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grin grew even more devious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to ponder how someone as serious and earnest as him became friends with the likes of Quinn and Philip, known for being playboys.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, I realized he was quite skilled in this area too, perhaps even more so than his companions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm hungry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My stomach grumbled, reminding me that I hadn't eaten a thing all night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to stand up, but Elliott showed no intention to let me go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up a sausage from the table, bringing it to my lips with a smirk. "Alright, I'll feed you. Eat up, so you'll have energy later."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was left speechless and glared at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, hunger overpowered me. Sausages were irresistibly tempting in the late hours, prompting me to take a bite obediently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're already married. What's wrong with saying that?" He seemed somewhat dismissive as he fed me the entire sausage, then took a glass of orange juice from the table, bringing it to my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to drink it, but he beat me to it and took a big gulp of the orange juice himself.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="282.html">« Prev</a><a href="284.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
