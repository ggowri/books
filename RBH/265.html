After a long while, he said hesitantly, "Mrs. Laura Bryant asked me to inform you that you should move all your stuff out of Serenity Villa as soon as possible. I'm sorry, Mrs. Bryant. To be honest, I really don't want you and Mr. Bryant to divorce. But I really face challenges, too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sean's words were like a bolt of lightning that suddenly struck the top of my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had anticipated that upon discovering my infertility, Laura might attempt to manipulate me into divorcing Elliott. However, it never occurred to me that she would fall out with me so swiftly, especially considering Elliott and I had been married for several years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She requested that I should move everything away from here. Wasn't this a disguised "eviction order" urging me to leave Elliott soon?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sudden pang in my heart. I didn't blame Sean because I knew that he was just a communicator. I nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I see. Tell her I will get out of here after my return from Louis City."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that said, I turned around and walked out of Serenity Villa quickly. Shortly after I stepped on the accelerator and drove away, my phone rang. It was Laura. My heart sank when I looked at the number displayed on the screen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to skip the call, but she called again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, I had to face her... I mustered up the courage, pressed the answer button, and said into the phone as usual, "Laura, what's the matter?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I'd like to meet and chat with you. Are you free now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Laura was polite, but I had long understood what she wanted to talk to me about.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to Louis City. What do you want to say on the way? Can you say it on the phone?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't willing to meet her. Wouldn't it be more embarrassing to say this kind of thing face to face?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. I'll explain it over the phone." Laura took a deep breath. "Madeline, I know you are a good woman, and I know you love Elliott, but he should have informed you of his grandpa's situation. I told you a long time ago that you and Elliott are desperate to have a baby. So, I hope you can understand my difficulties and those of our family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura didn't mention my test result directly, but I could clearly sense the meaning behind the words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can understand," I said to the phone, pretending to be calm, but in fact, my hands were shaking all the time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good girl, I know you must be heartbroken, but it is inevitable. It will be a disaster for everyone. Jasper and I have discussed it. If you have any conditions, feel free to tell us, and we will try our best to satisfy you. In short, you and Elliott are wife and husband. You should part in peace and not spoil our friendship. What do you think?" Laura continued politely.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="264.html">« Prev</a><a href="266.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
