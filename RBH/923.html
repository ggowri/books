He saw my red face and the item in my hand, and his smile grew more suggestive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me with a teasing glint in his eyes:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this? So eager to open it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My face turned even redder, and I gave him a speechless look:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought it was a disposable glove, not what you think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's smile deepened, "What do you think I was thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked knowingly, making me a bit embarrassed and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know exactly what I mean," he laughed out loud, looking every bit the arrogant playboy. "I was just talking about you being eager to eat fruit. What were you thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt instantly embarrassed and covered my face with my hands, not wanting him to see my flushed cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's late. I'll run the bath. You take a shower and then get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott left my side and headed to the bathroom. Soon, I heard the sound of running water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked around the unfamiliar, luxurious room, feeling a bit dazed. How did I end up here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Elliott's phone, which was charging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew if I called Paige or Fiona, they would come pick me up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But my legs felt like they were made of lead, and I was exhausted. The soft, luxurious bed looked so inviting. I just wanted to lie down and sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was really tired, completely worn out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat down on the edge of the bed, and just then, Elliott came out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feeling tired?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned over, supporting himself on the bed, his lips close to my ear, whispering softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah." My voice was thick with exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll carry you in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said that, he lifted me up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively wrapped my arms around his neck as he held me close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling was both familiar and surreal, like a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly carried me to the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if it were the most natural thing, he started undressing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the process, his gaze was pure, his movements professional, without a hint of hesitation. It felt like we were an old married couple, and this was just routine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, he did lose his memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, he only remembered our happy times, so to him, bathing me was just a habit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had moved on, but I was still trapped in those painful memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I was lost in thought, he gently lowered me into the warm water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warm water enveloped my body, leaving only my head above the surface. The heat eased my exhaustion a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want me to help you wash, or do you want to do it yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes started to show a glimmer of desire, his voice turning husky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do it myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling shy under his gaze, I submerged myself further into the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew I wasn't comfortable yet, so he didn't push. He said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, you soak here. To save time, I'll shower over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed to the shower area and then, naturally, undressed in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe how natural and unreserved he was. I wanted to say something, but words failed me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His impressive physique and the prominent bulge were a temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My blood was boiling, and my whole body felt electrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly looked away, unable to face him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed oblivious to my reaction, stepping into the shower and turning on the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bathroom was spacious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soaking in the tub, I felt a suffocating tension, my breathing heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined that coming to Korea for a break would lead me to Elliott's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suspected this was all part of Elliott's plan. I pinched myself hard, reminding myself not to fall for his tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole night felt like a movie, full of twists and surprises, leaving me in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe Elliott was showering in front of me. I sneaked a glance at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the bathroom light, his perfect muscles and V-shaped torso were mesmerizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No man had ever showered so openly in front of me. Wasn't this blatant seduction?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott must be doing this on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately avoided looking at me, closing his eyes with a satisfied expression. He gathered himself up and rinsed off under the shower with a carefree attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he be so shameless in front of her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so entranced that when he turned off the shower and opened his eyes, I forgot to look away and just stared directly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly smiled, a bright smile like an eighteen-year-old, and his raspy voice reached my ears:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Had enough? Any more and I'll start charging."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was mortified and quickly submerged myself in the water again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His laughter echoed, and I hid underwater, feeling utterly embarrassed. I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare open my eyes, only noticing my heart pounding like a perpetual motion machine.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="922.html">« Prev</a><a href="924.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
