Following closely behind, their driver began unloading a heap of baby gear and toys from the trunk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time they come over, they always bring a ton of gifts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Why are they fighting?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Carole got out of the car, she saw the situation and hurried over to ask.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaos had finally subsided. Laura spotted Carole and her mother, along with the items they were carrying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused for a moment, then, as if struck by sudden realization, she moved towards Carole's mother, asking in a self-deceptive manner:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here? Are you her backup? Are you planning to help her hide my grandson?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's tone was dripping with arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole's mother exuded a calm and collected demeanor, appearing even more regal and elegant in front of Laura now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already figured out what was going on. With a faint smile, she said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to see my grandson, why call for backup? And what's this about hiding my grandson? I don't understand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hint of skepticism, Laura inquired:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it truly your grandson? Not mine?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole's mom couldn't help but chuckle, but before she could even utter a word, Carole chimed in:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We heard you've already mistaken someone for your grandson once before, and now you're here doing it again? Madeline has made it clear she doesn't want you in her home. Mrs. Bryant, you're a prominent figure in Hoswich city, you really should be mindful of your image!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole always has a sharp tongue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few words left Laura utterly humiliated. She retorted, trying to justify herself:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just here to see for myself, if the kid looks like Elliott or not. If not, I promise I won't bother you again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bryants are of noble lineage. If Madeline had borne Elliott's child, why would she deny it? The fact that she won't let you see the child speaks volumes. Why insist on humiliating yourself? You once believed Madeline was barren, so you cast her aside and arranged for Elliott to marry another woman. Now, you're here seeking your grandchild. Mrs. Bryant, one must have some dignity. There are surveillance cameras at the entrance. If Madeline were to post the footage on social media, I wonder what the reaction would be."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole thoroughly humiliated Laura, without a shred of remorse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when Carole pointed out the surveillance camera installed at the entrance, Laura was left standing there, completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scandal that unfolded on the day of Elliott and Giselle's engagement had already dragged the Bryant family's name through the mud in Hoswich city. Thankfully, the Bryant family's PR skills were strong enough to spin the narrative, painting them as victims of Giselle's deceit. Otherwise, the Bryant family would have been run out of Hoswich city by now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I were to really expose the surveillance footage this time, the consequences would be more than Laura could handle.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="857.html">« Prev</a><a href="859.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
