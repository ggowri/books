Everyone, don't just chat. Help yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica could hear the impatience in Carole's tone and immediately smiled to defuse the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had never heard that Quinn had a girlfriend before, and now she's pregnant in the blink of an eye? That was fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While eating her food, Zara complained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, Zara. Isn't it normal for Quinn to have a girlfriend? Having children is also a very normal thing. You're not a child anymore, so stop throwing tantrums all the time. Everyone spoils you, but I won't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole was displeased and slammed the fork heavily onto the table, then directly shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could tell that in this family, it seemed like everyone doted on Zara, except for Carole who had a genuine dislike for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Carole shouted, Zara felt so wronged that tears were about to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica, upon seeing the situation, hastily glared at Carole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carole, your sister rarely comes back. Why did you suddenly scold her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you always do this. You spoiled her when she was little, and now she's grown up and still acts like this. We finally managed to gather together for a meal, and she's constantly grumbling. She's already twenty years old, but still talks like a child. I can't stand it. Can't I say a few words?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole rolled her eyes directly, even though Nina and August were present, she couldn't be bothered to save face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carole was right, Zara, you were grown up now, you couldn't throw tantrums anymore. You couldn't let Madeline make fun of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, Carole said it to me, and you said it to me too! I'm not eating this meal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zara was very unhappy, so she simply threw down the fork and angrily went into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her departure instantly made everyone feel a little awkward. Seeing this, Nina could only smile awkwardly as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zara was indeed spoiled by us. Even now, when she is grown up, she still lacks manners. Jessica, please understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you being polite for? We are family. I have also watched Zara grow up. I know her personality is like this, it doesn't bother anyone. It will be fine in a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica tried to make excuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was quietly eating my meal, wanting to be just a background figure, but little did I know, at that moment, August suddenly looked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this Madeline? I have heard about you from my wife. How is your health now? Did you feel uncomfortable during pregnancy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was very gentle. He wore gold-rimmed glasses and had a handsome appearance, clearly indicating that he came from a well-off background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad. August, thank you for your concern," I replied indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I was torn in my heart, whether to take this opportunity and simply explain it to the Woods family, so as to avoid the situation getting more difficult to explain as time went on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline has been running around non-stop since she got pregnant. We had originally discussed getting them engaged before the baby was born, but Madeline has been too busy. This matter has been delayed until now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica smiled and explained at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have been avoiding the Woods family all this time, trying my best not to face them, but I didn't expect Jessica to be so understanding and find excuses for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was so good, and even his mother Jessica was so good. I felt even more ashamed because I was deceiving them with a child who wasn't even Quinn's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This matter must be resolved earlier. I can no longer hide it...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I made up my mind. I put down my fork, lifted my head, and mustered up the courage to say to Jessica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jessica, there is something I wanted to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, this was the foie gras you loved the most. It tasted amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before I could say anything, Quinn interrupted me directly with his words...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="684.html">« Prev</a><a href="686.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
