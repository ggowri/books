Moreover, the car was fully tinted, so people outside couldn't see inside at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why, but when I saw Elliott walking towards me step by step, I felt guilty. Even though I knew he couldn't see, I instinctively reclined the seat, not wanting him to notice someone inside the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I didn't expect that because this car hadn't been used for too long, many functions didn't work anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to recline the seat, but it made a loud noise. Immediately, I became anxious. At the same time, Elliott asked cautiously, "Madeline, what was that sound just now? Are you in the car? Are you not at home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very perceptive and suddenly noticed my abnormality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt very guilty. Without any preparation, I instinctively said, "I heard that your engagement ceremony was canceled, so I planned to go out and celebrate with friends. Is that not allowed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's footsteps came to a sudden halt. Through the car window, I could clearly see every movement he made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott froze, looking in my direction. Even though he wasn't actually looking at me, it made my heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were emotions in his expression that I couldn't understand. As he gradually approached my car, and even suddenly placed his hand on the hood of my car, I became very nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost thought I was discovered by Elliott, but he just angrily hammered my car hood without any reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you would rather meet with friends than see me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly admitted, without even any disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I was very unhappy in my heart when Elliott hit my car, now I couldn't do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at the moment when he hit the front of the car, I hastily covered the microphone and instinctively lowered my voice because I was afraid he would hear any noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me another chance, let's talk, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott hit the front of the car, he didn't even leave, but instead leaned against my car, making it impossible for me to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was really strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were so many cars parked in that row, why did Elliott choose to park near my old car and even lean on its front? I was truly speechless about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was helpless and angry, wanting to hang up the phone as soon as possible, so I said coldly, "There's really no need, Elliott. When did you become so pathetic? I don't have anything to talk to you about, that's it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to pay attention to what Elliott was feeling. After insulting him verbally, I immediately prepared to hang up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But little did I know, that just as I was about to hang up the phone, two cars nearby honked the horns simultaneously as they passed each other. The piercing sound echoed outside the window. At the same time, Elliott clearly heard the identical honking sound coming from my phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been sharp. At that moment, I saw his body bounce off my car. Elliott couldn't help but look around. Then, he suddenly yelled at the phone, "Madeline, where are you right now? Tell me the truth!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="644.html">« Prev</a><a href="646.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
