Yet, from certain angles, he carries a hint of my essence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, he hurt me too deeply back then, so he never got the chance to experience the joy of being a father to Noah.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's talk about it later, I'm too swamped right now to think about anything else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sidestepped his words, slipping my hand from his warm grasp, and turned to climb into the car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott noticed my gloom and didn't pry any further. Swiftly, he drove me back to Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At night, we still shared the same bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, Elliott was noticeably restless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was on the verge of drifting off to sleep when suddenly, he pulled me into his arms. Then, he gently lifted my chin and planted a soft kiss on my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I desire you... May I?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was soft, and before I could utter a word, he assertively captured my upper lip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Large hands began to expertly caress my skin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The long-lost jolt of electricity made my body tingle all over, his fingers blooming trails as they slid down my smooth back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My entire body went limp in an instant. However, reason quickly reminded me to avoid any physical contact with Elliott while I was treating him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately clamped down on his hand, both my words and actions signaling him to stop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's hand stilled, yet it didn't leave my back. In the dim light, his profound eyes gazed at me with a gentle warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand caressed my smooth waist, his voice laced with a hint of complaint:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, it's been a while since we've been intimate. Madeline, you seem particularly resistant to my advances now..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I've been too worn out lately."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't tell the truth, I can only find an excuse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand continued to gently caress my waist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it's been too long since I've been intimate with a man, but I've found that, at some point, I stopped resisting his advances as much as I used to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pressed down on his hand with all my strength, but the tingling sensation in my waist only made my body feel more limp and powerless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly sensed the subtle changes in my body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if receiving some signal, he suddenly rolled over, pinning me beneath him. Then, he kissed my lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kiss was both assertive and tender, carrying a dominance I once knew well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words I wanted to say got stuck in my throat, transforming in an instant into a breathless sigh...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tug-of-war between emotion and logic finally took effect. I triumphed over physical desire, forcefully pushing him away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I'm really beat, not in the mood."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I scrambled out of bed, hastily hitting the floor and struggling to pull together my disheveled clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was already on the brink.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My sudden intense reaction clearly took him aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat up, yanking the sheet to cover his lower half, his upper body bare to the world. In the dim light, the distinct lines of his muscles were faintly visible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, let out a sigh, and asked helplessly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what's going on? Why are you so resistant to my affection?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="865.html">« Prev</a><a href="867.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
