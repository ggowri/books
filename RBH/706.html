If it's feasible, we'll go on a trip to Norch City in the near future for investigation," I immediately said to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Recently?" Marcus looked at me in surprise. "Madeline, don't forget. You are a pregnant woman now. The most important thing for you at the moment is the baby in your belly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Marcus reminding me, I momentarily forgot about the fact that I was pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, thanks to Marcus' medication adjustment, I really had a relatively easy pregnancy. I didn't seem to experience the common symptoms that pregnant women often have, such as swelling, pubic bone pain, or restless sleep at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought it wouldn't be a problem for me to go to Norch City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. My recent physical condition has been fine, and besides, I have you by my side. What do I have to worry about? If anything happens, I still have you right next to me," I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, immediately waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, although I understood medicine, I might not be able to handle all unexpected situations. You are in the late stage of pregnancy now, so please do not take it lightly," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I know, I will assess it myself, besides, this is just our preliminary idea," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I know you really want to push yourself hard right now, but please don't exhaust yourself too much," Marcus advised me again, his eyes filled with deep concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and was about to say something more when, at that moment, my phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened the screen of my phone and saw that it was Quinn calling, so I immediately answered the phone. "Quinn, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, where are you now? I'm coming to find you," Quinn's voice on the phone sounded somewhat urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? I didn't feel wronged at all, Quinn. Don't overthink it. On the contrary, I was honest about the situation. Your parents didn't say anything to you, did they?" I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's meet and chat, I'm almost at your company, are you at the office?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll be at the company soon," I said, hanging up the phone. I instinctively glanced ahead and noticed that Marcus was already driving the car near Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus dropped me off at the Glory Group building, Quinn happened to get out of the car as well. He glanced at Marcus and me together, and then quickly walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, have you returned to Norch City?" Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, yes, I just talked to Madeline about my recent herbal medicine procurement and investigation. We also had a meal together. If you guys have something to discuss, go ahead. I'm heading back now." Without much further ado, Marcus and Quinn patted each other's shoulders before Marcus turned around and drove away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus left, Quinn immediately grabbed my shoulder. He looked at me with a gleam of brightness in his eyes and couldn't wait to say to me, "Madeline, let's go to your office and talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought that we had already made ourselves clear between him and me, so I don't know why he suddenly came to find me so urgently. Despite being confused, I nodded and went to my office with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Quinn closed the office door, he immediately turned around and looked at me with calm and affectionate eyes. After taking a deep breath, he said, "Madeline, the reason I didn't take you back today is because I had a heartfelt conversation with my parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up at him, very calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened next? Quinn, what do you want to say?" I said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="705.html">« Prev</a><a href="707.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
