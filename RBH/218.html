Elliott, let's go wash up in the sink outside."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, I didn't care if Elliott would agree. I just dragged him and walked out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked in a hurry and was very annoyed. I stopped until we arrived at the sink in the yard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grabbed Elliott's hands, opened the faucet, and washed them. Then, I picked up the hand sanitizer and used it to scrub his hands repeatedly. After doing this, I felt his hands finally clean.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found a clean towel and soaked it in water. When I was about to wipe the stain on his chest, he lifted my chin, looked at me, and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's sudden smile made me a little confused. I blurted, "Why are you smiling?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me with bright and loving eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I smile at you because you are unhappy about another woman. You are jealous."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm not jealous of her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried my best to deny it, but I still felt a little embarrassed when he teased me like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott saw me being shy, so he put his arms around my waist and couldn't help but kiss me gently on the lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott! We are at someone else's house."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized this and punched his chest gently. He smiled even more happily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned close to my head and nibbled my ear playfully, "So what? It's natural to kiss my own wife."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's gentleness was so irresistible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I was nibbled and teased by him, my face turned red instantly. I was about to say something else, but a crisp sound suddenly came from the kitchen door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott subconsciously let me go. We both looked at the door and saw Giselle standing there in shock. A broken plate and grapes were scattered on the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that she originally prepared to bring some grapes to wash in the sink, but she bumped into Elliott and me, who were kissing just now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I perceived the sadness in her eyes, but immediately, she forced a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did...Did I disturb you, Elliott?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," I replied hastily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good. I wanted to wash some grapes for you to eat, but I accidentally dropped them on the ground."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle hurriedly squatted down to pick up the grapes, but her hand touched the broken pieces of the plate by accident. She screamed in pain, and her fingers were bleeding instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay? Let me pick them up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott also squatted down. Seeing Giselle's fingers with blood, he quickly held her hand and tried to stop bleeding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a minor injury. I'm fine, Elliott. Let me do it. Go inside with Madeline to eat," Giselle urged. She looked panicked and lonely at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott insisted, "You go inside and bandage the wound first. Let me deal with them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his head and glanced at me, motioning for me to take her in and bandage it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly understood what he meant, so I pulled Giselle into the house. Nicole soon bandaged Giselle's fingers. After a while, Elliott walked in with a plate of grapes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone sat down around the dining table again, but after Giselle got injured, everyone was eating in silence, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, have you taken the medicine I gave you before? I went to the doctor to prescribe medicine a few days ago, but I didn't have time to send it to you. Since you're here today, you can take it back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Nicole walked to the cabinet on the side, took out some medicine, and put it in front of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nicole, can this medicine really help me get pregnant? Why doesn't it take effect after I've taken it for so long?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="217.html">« Prev</a><a href="219.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
