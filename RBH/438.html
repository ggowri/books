Coupled with the wild nights I'd spent with Elliott... The more I thought about it, the more panicked I felt inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could the universe really be playing such a massive joke on me at this crucial moment? What if I really was pregnant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How would I face Elliott?" I couldn't help but think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind was a mess, and I found myself unconsciously caressing my still-flat belly, torn between hoping I really was pregnant and fearing it was just a false alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my turmoil, Quinn patted my shoulder and said softly, "Don't worry, what's meant to be will happen. Even if you are pregnant, we'll find a solution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," I replied softly, not knowing what else to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're pregnant, isn't that a good thing? Elliott has been hoping for a son. The Bryant family would be thrilled if you were," Fiona said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona didn't know about the recent developments. She thought Elliott and I were still blissfully together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, Laura would have jumped for joy if she had heard I was pregnant before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, everything has changed... If I really were carrying a child, there was no way I'd let the Bryant family have them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, a wave of hatred surged within me. I clenched my fists without realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The results should be ready. I'll check on my computer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time ticked by, Fiona calculated when the results would be ready and muttered to herself. Then she turned on her computer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held my breath, my eyes fixed on her without blinking, my heart jumping to my throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Fiona looked relaxed, but a few seconds later, her expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she looked up at me intently as if she had seen a miracle, and gradually, a smile spread across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it? What's the result?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was clearly anxious. He couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona nodded vigorously, her face lit up with joy. She immediately stood up and walked over to me, grabbing my hands. I could feel her hands trembling, and even her lips quivered as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's unbelievable! You're really pregnant! The blood test shows your HCG levels are over 4000! Congratulations! You're going to be a mom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona looked at me, her eyes brimming with excited tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As my best friend, she knew all too well the struggles I had faced trying to conceive over the years and how much I longed for a baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mind felt like it was struck by lightning. My mind went blank. I couldn't even say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I blankly stared as Fiona wept with joy for me, yet my heart remained eerily calm, unsure of what to think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was going to be a mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was having Elliott's baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was plunged into a profound daze. For a moment, I couldn't decide whether to feel happy or sad, as if I had suddenly lost all sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, are you sure there's no mistake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was just as shocked, his mouth agape. He hurried over to check with Fiona again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="437.html">« Prev</a><a href="439.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
