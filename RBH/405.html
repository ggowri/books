She used to beat me up all the time when we were kids."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they were kids? Could she be his childhood sweetheart?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be the short-haired woman waiting for him outside the hotel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My curiosity peaked. "Since the two of you grew up together, is she your childhood sweetheart? Quinn, you always claimed to be single! I had no idea you had so many secrets!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left my mouth, Quinn thumped my head hard. He chuckled, "Childhood sweetheart? She's my sister, Carole. Thankfully, she's helping me out in managing the family's affairs, or I wouldn't be as comfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That explained it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was news to me that Quinn even had a sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, it all made sense. No wonder she dared to boss Quinn around, and Quinn didn't dare to argue back. Seems like he was really scared of his sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you actually have a sister. Why haven't you ever mentioned her before?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly, "I don't like talking about family matters, since I find it unnecessary. I am who I am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn always gave off a vibe of being laid-back, and I couldn't help but laugh along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of our banter, I almost forgot about the unpleasant encounter with Elliott in the car just now, as well as the important matter I wanted to ask him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Quinn brought it up himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle's paternity test didn't happen today. She was about to go into the examination room, but Laura suddenly came out, crying and stopping the test, insisting that the child is Elliott's. She said if Elliott didn't believe her, they could do the test after the child was born. Elliott insisted to get the test done initially, but Laura threatened to harm herself with the scissors from the examination room. Faced with that, Elliott had no choice but to give in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn recounted what happened in the examination room, which matched Elliott's version that he told me in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Laura really that sure Giselle wouldn't deceive her?" I felt skeptical upon hearing Quinn's words. Something about this situation didn't sit right with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I find that strange too. Considering how adamantly Elliott denied any connection to the child, why does Laura still trust the other woman so blindly? It doesn't make sense to me either, but Laura fully trusts Giselle now. With Laura backing Giselle up, nobody can touch Giselle. This woman gained the Bryant family's trust in such a short time. I can say she's definitely not someone simple to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn analyzed the situation rationally, echoing my own confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't wrap my head around it either. But for now, there was nothing we can do about Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt like I was caught up in a deadlock because of Giselle, and if I stayed in this situation for too long, I'd gradually lose control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I couldn't break the deadlock at the moment, I couldn't afford to sit back and do nothing. I had to find another way out of this predicament as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, I remembered Quinn's angry words towards Giselle in the hospital today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remembered him mentioning something about how the Bryant Group's core components that they were supplying to the Glory Group for their partnership, weren't exclusive to the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that he had another source to acquire them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Quinn really had another source, I could directly cut off the cooperation with the Bryant Group once my dad woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, the Glory Group and the Bryant Group wouldn't have any business dealings, which would give me more control as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, I subconsciously looked at Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps my gaze carried too much cunning calculation, as Quinn was startled by my look when he suddenly turned his head. He clutched his heart and exclaimed, "Why are you suddenly staring at me like that? What are you planning? You're giving me the chills!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="404.html">« Prev</a><a href="406.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
