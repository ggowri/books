Is it a high-quality pearl necklace?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, she quickly asked about the necklace. At the same time, she walked up to me and unexpectedly grabbed my hand affectionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked as if we already had a good relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled faintly and calmly said, "Yes, this was just given to me by Laura. I didn't expect you to notice it at first glance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl who came from a small town and lost her father at a young age could instantly tell that this was a high-quality pearl. Her perception alone is enough to show that I cannot underestimate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she deliberately acted intimate with me in front of Laura, which made me even more cautious. However, I didn't want to show it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I was planning the jewelry event for someone else before, I had found out. It turns out it was Laura who gave it to you. Laura is really kind to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing that it was Laura who gave it to me, there was a hint of disappointment in Giselle's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I saw all of her subtle reactions. But I just smiled and didn't say much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, I only have one, otherwise I could have given one to Giselle as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura smiled and said. Her meaning was that, in her mind, she saw Giselle and me the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can that be possible? I cannot afford such expensive gifts. Besides, this necklace only looks good on Madeline. I am still too young and not worthy of such luxury."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle quickly and obediently said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her compliment, Laura turned her head and gave me a satisfied look, then nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, this pearl necklace complements Madeline's skin even more delicate. She indeed looks beautiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Laura Bryant, did you give the medicine I brought to you last time to Mrs. Bryant? The doctor said that medicine has a very good effect. If Mrs. Bryant has finished drinking it, I will go and buy some more for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole walked up to Laura at this moment and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medicine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly recalled that Sean had indeed handed me a few packets of medicine last time, saying that Laura specifically instructed me to drink them. However, I had thrown those medicines into the trash can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, it turned out that Nicole had helped to buy that medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was instantly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the previous life, under Laura's coercion, I drank medicine hundreds of times. However, until my dying moments, I still couldn't conceive Elliott's child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did I not have any children, but I also got stomach cancer at a young age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no one in my family had ever heard of anyone dying from stomach cancer. Moreover, I was still so young, not even 30 years old at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Nicole bought the medicine, is it possible that they tampered with it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that my infertility and stomach cancer in my previous life were related to this medicine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did they start planning from now on, or did they make their move later?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I directly kept this matter in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I just finished drinking that medicine. If it's convenient, could you please help me buy some more? Laura really hopes that Elliott and I can have a child now. If I get pregnant, I will definitely thank you very much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of doubt surged in my heart, but on my face, I displayed a calm expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had already thrown away the previous medicine, so I could let her buy some again and then ask Fiona to analyze the ingredients for me. In this way, I would be able to know if my suspicion was true or false.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="121.html">« Prev</a><a href="123.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
