I'm tired. I want to sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately tried to push Elliott away, pulling the blanket over my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just had sex."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shouted in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott reached out, affectionately tickling my nose, somewhat unsatisfied but still stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisp sound of a belt hitting echoed in the ward soon after.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to sleep, I'll watch over you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When my tired eyes involuntarily closed, I heard Elliott's whisper in my ear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Various tests showed that my body was fine. Elliott directly arranged for my discharge and brought me back to Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Fiona and Paige were surprised by the sudden reconciliation between Elliott and me, they had gotten used to it, so they didn't say much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, on the other hand, seemed understanding. He didn't say much and disappeared again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a long time since I returned to Serenity Villa. Sean, upon seeing me, was both shocked and delighted, immediately arranging for a large table of food, saying it was to welcome Elliott and me back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had planned to go to work, but Elliott, citing my health, asked me to rest at home for an extra day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also took a day off specifically to stay at home with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had planned to visit Austin and Lily at Bryant Hospital after lunch, so Lily wouldn't worry since I hadn't appeared for several days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what I didn't expect was that while Elliott and I were having lunch, we suddenly had two unexpected guests at home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dining room of the Serenity Villa was not connected to the living room but was set on the other side of the kitchen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, people entering the living room couldn't immediately see the situation in the dining room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I were enjoying our meal when suddenly we heard voices in the living room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I think the color of this sofa doesn't match the curtains. When I move in, I'll change this sofa right away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, it doesn't really match. That painting looks dull, not bright enough. It should be replaced too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right. Mom, Elliott likes the dishes you cook. When I move in, you should move in with us too, so I don't have to worry about you. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's talk about that later. As long as you and Elliott are happy, where I live doesn't matter."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately recognized the speakers. It was Giselle and her mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like they couldn't wait to occupy this place before I divorced Elliott. They thought I wasn't here and came to Serenity Villa for a visit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't taken over yet, but they were already planning to change the decoration of this love nest of Elliott and me. Giselle's ambition was indeed not to be underestimated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put down my fork, my expression instantly turning serious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott also heard the voices in the living room, his expression darkened as he stood up to go out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Sean rushed into the living room in a fluster, carefully telling us, "I don't know who told them the password. They just came in suddenly and startled me too. Don't worry, I'll ask them to leave right away."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="376.html">« Prev</a><a href="378.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
