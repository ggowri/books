We could only watch helplessly as they dragged us from the main road onto a winding path that led to an unknown destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at the increasingly desolate mountains ahead, I felt waves of abdominal pain in my stomach. In that moment, my heart was filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After investing in Dalton's movie, I researched online about some reports on Mexico. I knew that place was very chaotic, and once Jane and I were taken there by them, our fate would definitely be very tragic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jade suddenly received a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know who the person calling was, I only heard her angrily shouting into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? There are only 2 million dollars in the box? Damn it, Madeline, how dare you deceive me! You're asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, Jade's eyes instantly filled with anger. She angrily shouted at me and rushed toward me, kicking me hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was caught off guard and fell directly to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, my labor pains were getting stronger and stronger. When she kicked me, I was in so much pain that I passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately fell to the ground, convulsing in pain, and Jade was about to rush over and hit me. At that moment, Jane rushed forward, disregarding everything, to protect me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Ms. Mayers is about to give birth! Don't harm her! We can meet your demands, you just want money, right? As long as you let us go, I will immediately call the finance director and have her transfer the remaining money to your account! Don't harm Ms. Mayers, she is pregnant, don't be so cruel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was very afraid of Jade's cruelty. She desperately protected me while begging desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lay on the ground, panting heavily in big gasps of breath, cold sweat pouring out of my body incessantly. I was in so much pain that I couldn't speak, only able to desperately clutch onto Jane's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you had brought 10 million dollars in cash, there might have been a chance for me to let her go. How dare she try to deceive me with only 2 million dollars? I will not spare her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was extremely angry. She walked up to Jane and grabbed her, throwing her aside. Then, she pulled my hair, knowing very well that I was in pain, but she laughed brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, do you know what women who are stranded in Mexico face? You left me with nothing, and now I will make you taste the bitterness of hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Delin, it is a good thing that she is pregnant. When we arrive in Mexico, we can directly sell the baby in her belly, and then lock her in our basement to produce milk. This woman is so beautiful, surely many wealthy people would be willing to buy the milk she produces..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, besides, this woman seems to know martial arts. She must have trained regularly, and her organs would definitely fetch a lot of money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade's subordinates couldn't help but start discussing at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their tone was so relaxed and natural, as if they were selling us and selling livestock. Hearing their shocking conversations, I experienced an unprecedented despair in that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane and I were once again being dragged along by them, and as they led us deeper into the increasingly desolate woods, my heart raced and I desperately wanted to save myself, but I had no way to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, I seemed to hear a roaring sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Madeline, where were you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I was hallucinating, but I heard someone shouting my name loudly. Then, I saw a tall man riding a cross-country mountain bike in front of me. He appeared like a god, descending right in front of me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="746.html">« Prev</a><a href="748.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
