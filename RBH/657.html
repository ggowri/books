As long as I could successfully marry Elliott, no one would care about the process. All that mattered to everyone was the result. Yes, I graduated from a prestigious school... Because I graduated from a prestigious school, I am unwilling to work in a conventional way, and even more unwilling to have a husband like Rowan! I have liked Elliott since I was young. He was like a star in the sky to me. Initially, I thought he was out of reach. But gradually, as I got closer to him, one day I suddenly wondered why I couldn't marry Elliott. Just because my family is poor? Does that mean I can't marry a top-tier man like him? Fate made me submit, but I refuse to give up!" Giselle murmured, as if she was speaking to us, but also reflecting on herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, she probably touched something deep inside. Suddenly, Giselle grabbed the remaining whisky on the table, tilted her head back, and poured it directly into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bottle of wine was left by Elliott, with about half of it remaining. It was very strong and had a strong taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle didn't even blink her eyes. Just like drinking water, she gulped down the whisky in one breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of us looked at each other. No one stepped forward to stop her, and for a </span><span>moment, we didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Giselle went crazy now and desperately wanted to retaliate against me, I believe none of us would spare her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she suddenly dissected herself in front of us, which surprised us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige probably thought of Jezebel, so she looked at Giselle and couldn't help but angrily shout, "You admire successful men. We can understand. But, do you have to stoop so low as to seduce someone else's husband? There are many wealthy men in the world like Elliott. You can go find them. After all, you are still young. But do you really have to hurt Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle drank a lot of alcohol, so she was a bit unsteady on her feet and decided to just sit directly on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glasses and empty bottles on the table were knocked to the ground by her, making a harsh sound. Giselle looked at Paige, once again revealing that elusive smile, and said, "There are indeed many wealthy men in this world, but the only one I can get close to is Elliott. We have known each other since childhood, and his parents owe my family. Originally, if it weren't for you inexplicably marrying Elliott, he would still be single, and I would have many opportunities to make him fall in love with me. But unfortunately, you suddenly appeared and became his wife. It's truly despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle pointed at me. She laughed and cried alternately, resembling a lunatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn saw that Giselle was starting to go crazy and worried that she would harm me. So, he immediately stood in front of me and then said to Giselle, "There are many women surrounding Elliott. Even without Madeline, there will be other women, and you may not have a chance. Giselle, stop avoiding reality. You have done so many bad things and will surely be punished. I think, with all the books you have read, you cannot fail to understand this. The outcome today is caused by you. We won't do anything to you tonight, but I hope that after tonight, you won't appear in front of Madeline again! As for how the Bryant family will deal with you, think about it yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle still held onto the bottle of wine. She still had a terrifying smile on her face. Then, she looked at Quinn and, when she looked at me, she said with some jealousy, "Madeline, I don't understand why Elliott likes you and even Quinn dotes on you. What do I lack compared to you, except for my family background? Why can you get their love while I have nothing?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="656.html">« Prev</a><a href="658.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
