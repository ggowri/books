With your qualities, before you got married, couldn't men who pursued you go from Hoswich to Polerous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Adam heard me say this, he immediately opened his mouth wide in astonishment. He seemed to find it incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really wasn't joking with you. No one had actually pursued me before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled faintly. It was the first time I felt a little regretful. Yes, surprisingly, no man had ever pursued me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it must be because you were too outstanding that ordinary men were afraid to pursue you. They were afraid that you wouldn't be interested in them. There used to be a very beautiful girl in our school. Her family background was average. Therefore, many boys dared to pursue her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam smiled and comforted me. Afterward, he started chatting with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does that beautiful girl look like? Do you have a photo of her?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have it. Just wait a moment," Adam opened his phone. He searched through his photo album for a while. Then, he handed me a photo, "That beautiful lady right there is her. Her name is Giselle Cole. Back then, many guys were chasing after her. But I don't know what she was thinking. In the end, she chose my best friend to be her boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle Cole?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is really a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that my current assistant was actually Giselle's college classmate. Moreover, he was also a good friend of her boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the photo. Giselle, wearing a graduation gown, was sitting on the grass with a few other girls, her smile radiant. In fact, her features couldn't be described as exquisite. But when they came together, she looked exceptionally beautiful. She was like a lily in a secluded valley. Her appearance was indeed the type that boys would like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the campus belle. She had also been pursued by many people... Just with these two points, she was much stronger than the old me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Giselle had everything that I never had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder, despite being born into a wealthy family, I used to crawl at her feet and became a discarded pawn thrown into the sea by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she had nothing, yet she could be so confident. In the end, she successfully captured Elliott's heart...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What was this girl like as a person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I stared at Giselle in the photo, I couldn't help but curiously ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not quite sure either. But I think she was very arrogant, and she was quite ambitious. It seemed like she always knew what she wanted. In contrast, my good friend probably didn't have as much ambition. He liked to go with the flow. So, I think they may not last long together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam frowned and analyzed. He seemed eager to share with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you ever pursue her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but fold my hands and ask with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam burst into laughter. He shook his head and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, she wasn't the type I liked. I didn't like girls who were too pretentious. She was too arrogant. I was already tired of just living my life. I didn't want to trouble myself anymore. After all, I still wanted to live well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam's words made me burst into laughter as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his description, I gained some more understanding of Giselle from a different perspective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that even though Giselle chose her younger boyfriend, she still appeared like a queen in front of him. No wonder I saw her scolding him that day at the flower shop. Perhaps, this is their usual dynamic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was chatting with Adam. At that moment, he suddenly remembered that he hadn't finished reading the materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Adam quickly picked up the information. He also thoughtfully helped me with the annotations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder nowadays young girls like to be treated warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I watched him, I became more and more emotional. How foolish was I in my previous life to give up other men for Elliott?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was thinking this, Jade suddenly pushed open the door to my office and walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she entered, she went straight past the desk. Immediately, she came over and affectionately placed her hand on my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I heard that you have already started casting. I have a suitable candidate to recommend to you!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="70.html">« Prev</a><a href="72.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
