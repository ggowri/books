Finally, he released my lips and my body with a sense of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, his eyes filled with deep confusion. At that moment, I unexpectedly sensed a hint of sadness in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was being so affectionate towards you, and yet you didn't have any reaction at all?" After a long pause, Elliott, with a calm voice, finally asked the perplexity in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My suspended body finally landed smoothly. I quickly stood up straight, even though my lips were swollen from his kiss, for some reason, my heart was unusually calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in this calmness, there was also a hint of inexplicable... excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my lifetime, it was hard to imagine that I had successfully resisted Elliott's deadly temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was completely impossible in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, a person really slowly lets go of another person. Not only do their emotions gradually become unaffected by them, but even their body gradually loses the necessary ups and downs towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, is it finally my turn to win?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn is right, not caring is the best weapon for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Elliott's lost and bewildered expression at this moment, I realized for the first time that I had won the game we just played.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of reaction do you expect from me? Come on, it's broad daylight, with people coming and going. It wouldn't be appropriate if someone saw us." I wickedly wiped the corner of my mouth, looking at him, and casually laughed. Then, I effortlessly took two steps back, retreating to a safe distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned at me, his deep, ocean-like eyes now a dull gray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned against the wall, no longer as upright as before, but rather somewhat dejected, especially with his shirt unbuttoned at the chest, which made his upper body appear disheveled and added a touch of weariness and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline..." he murmured my name softly, wanting to say something, but his lips moved slightly and in the end, he didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are all still waiting for me to go back. The drama we invested in started filming today. I'm very busy, sorry, I don't have time to accompany you." I smiled politely, waved goodbye, and turned around to go in the direction I came from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The classical long dress is truly a great thing to showcase body curves. When I put on this thing, along with this cobblestone road and high heels, my entire waist involuntarily starts swaying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I think, at this moment, I must have been extremely sexy, because for the first time, I found absolute confidence here with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't turn back, didn't look at his expression, and didn't care at all whether he had left or not. I quickly turned a corner and returned to the set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole process, I was gone for about ten minutes or so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was looking for me everywhere, and when he saw me, he immediately walked over. "Madeline, where did you just go? You scared me, I thought I had lost you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was such an innocent and spontaneous little boy. I smiled and reached out to pat his head. "I went to the restroom, has the shooting started already? Come on, let's go and see how it turned out."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="144.html">« Prev</a><a href="146.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
