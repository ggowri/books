Eventually, state media directly defined the virus as N1, a new type of influenza virus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As those news reports were released, we were shocked to see data being released from various regions. The number of deaths and infections from the virus was increasing at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as we gathered around the fireplace, our hearts suddenly grew heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that this virus is as serious as the SARS epidemic, and Hoswich Hospital is now overcrowded. You must be very careful," Paige reminded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, most of the city started to lockdown the city. Hoswich government should soon take similar measures," Quinn added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced subconsciously at Marcus, who was already a little restless, so I decided to stand up and said, "Marcus, it seems we have to end the vacation early. Come on, let's go to my company first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately understood what I meant. He nodded, stood up, and agreed, "Okay, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going?" Seeing both of us stand up, Quinn asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus' company has a drug called anti-flucapsule. This drug has a significant effect on this virus. I want to cooperate with him to bring this drug to the market as soon as possible. I have tried it myself and the effect is very good," I explained the situation truthfully. Later, we bid farewell to Paige and wanted to leave with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, it was Christmas day. I had planned to wait until the second day to start working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, perhaps due to the cooling effect of the heavy snowfall, the dire conditions reported in the news clearly indicate that the situation of the epidemic was much worse than that of my previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have a car. Let me take you to Glory Group!" After hearing my plan, Quinn stood up immediately and wanted to follow us and leave without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an urgent situation. We bid farewell to the others and drove back to Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, I notified Adam and Isaac in advance to wait for us at the company. Upon arriving at the company, everyone immediately entered the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I handed the previously drawn-up agreement to Marcus for review. Marcus also called his subordinates to Glory Group. After all, the collaboration involved a lot of money. Although we were friends, we still needed to be cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After confirming that there were no problems with the agreement, we signed the contract directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus told me that Tigress Pharmacy Company's production plant did not stop working during Christmas. Once the contract came into effect and the first payment was transferred to their account, they could quickly bring the first batch of medicines to market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the circumstances, everything got done sooner, the better. We confirmed some specific cooperation details. After that, I immediately asked Isaac to issue an emergency notice, asking colleagues from all relevant departments to return to work early, fully cooperate to promote the drug, and strive to make it accepted by the market as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next few days, I was swamped, and I barely had time to go home. I temporarily prepared a room in the company as a living room, where I ate and slept at the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hoswich's situation became more urgent day by day. Soon, the hospital issued emergency news about the shortage of masks and protective clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, I had anticipated that and went into production early. After receiving those messages, I immediately instructed Isaac to distribute relevant materials in batches and deliver them to major hospitals in Hoswich for free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, I just wanted to make a small contribution to the epidemic. But unexpectedly, such a donation inadvertently made Glory Group stand out among the companies and greatly enhanced the company's brand awareness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, many downstream suppliers came to us, hoping to purchase products from Glory Group.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="493.html">« Prev</a><a href="495.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
