You have a whole life to live and will meet someone who truly cares about you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was afraid I would think things after I got home, so he comforted me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. I see. Quinn, thank you. Although I don't know why you helped me, thank you anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Quinn and couldn't help but express gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my last life, I had never had such a close male friend. In this life, I felt what a true male friend was from Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not at all!" Quinn smiled and patted my head lovingly. "Elliott has gone too far, so I can't help but sympathize with you. Don't fall in love with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His joke made me laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Elliott's quiet character, I preferred Quinn's straightforward style. I didn't have to guess what he was thinking, which was nice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. After being with Elliott, I no longer had any feelings for other ordinary men."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tone also became more relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? But I'm not an ordinary man. Be careful."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn deliberately joked with me and winked at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really could cheer people up instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh. Then, I waved to him, turned around, unlocked the door to my house, and walked in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already very late, and I didn't want to disturb my parents. After opening the door, I prepared to go upstairs gently and go to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I didn't expect the surveillance system in my house would sound the alarm. So, I still woke up my parents.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I reached the middle of the stairs, all the lights in my house were turned on. Austin and Lily stood at the corridor entrance, wearing pajamas and coats. When they discovered it was me, their expressions suddenly changed from vigilance to surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why are you back so late? Why didn't you tell us? Your dad and I thought there was a thief."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lily ran over happily. She felt joy from the bottom of her heart at the sight of me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly said with a smile, "Mom, I had a party with my friends and returned late. I thought you were all asleep, so I didn't disturb you. Sorry to wake you up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't stay out too late next time. It's not safe for girls. Are you hungry? I'll make you something to eat, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a mother, Lily always cared about my health.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's late, and I won't eat. I'm already full. Dad, do you miss me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled, held Lily's arm, and walked up the stairs. Then, I blinked at Austin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had been in Louis City for more than half a month. I could feel Austin's longing for me from his smile and eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are my only precious daughter. Of course, I miss you. It's too late today, and we should go to sleep. We'll catch up tomorrow," Austin smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded and urged them, "Okay. Dad, Mom, go to bed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I went to my room and closed the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know if it was an illusion, but Elliott's unique smell seemed to be in the room. Meanwhile, I discovered that my locked drawer was actually open.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I opened the drawer, I was surprised to find that my diary was missing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Elliott took my dairy away when he rested in my room last time?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might have known everything I had been thinking about those years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was not young anymore. He should not be interested in those childish things anymore, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it. Let him see it. Anyway, those thoughts were from long ago. They only represented my past and could no longer represent my present.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="230.html">« Prev</a><a href="232.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
