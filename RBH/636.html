As a result, for a while, all the media outlets started crazily reporting Elliott's love story with a mysterious woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that the mysterious woman's father had a favor towards the Bryant family and that the mysterious woman had known Elliott since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mysterious woman was nurtured by the Bryant family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were a perfect match...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, numerous media not only extensively reported these unsubstantiated stories, but also portrayed Giselle as a kind-hearted, morally upright, and independent woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Adam handed me these reports, I really wanted to laugh, so I smiled and asked, </span><span>"Who is secretly praising and flattering Giselle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who else could it be? It must be the PR department of the Bryant Group. I heard that when Giselle was a regular employee there, she was often bullied. Now that her status has changed dramatically, they are obviously trying to flatter her, so as not to be troubled by Giselle in the future. However, I can understand their behavior of praising her, but this praise is just too excessive, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam couldn't help but roll his eyes, showing a disapproving look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I went through those reports one by one. If I hadn't been involved in the incident, I might have been moved by Giselle and Elliott's love story just by reading these stories written by the editors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These short stories were depicted vividly and realistically, with solid evidence and reasoning. Even the details of their love for each other were constantly portrayed, written so beautifully that it completely erased the fact that Giselle was a mistress... This manipulation of public opinion was truly top-notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without exaggerating, how can they appear so compatible? Let them praise each other as they want, it doesn't concern me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I flipped through those reports, and the more I looked, the more disgusted I felt. I simply threw them on the table and didn't want to look anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are erasing your and Mr. Bryant's past. Why does Madeline, who is so outstanding, have to facilitate someone else's good fortune? Giselle, as a mistress, destroyed your marriage with such unethical means and dared to manipulate public opinion, portraying herself as innocent. Hmph! Madeline, watch how I deal with her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't intend to make a big deal out of it, but Adam felt sorry for me. He had a look as if he wanted to retaliate for me immediately, which made me laugh for a moment. "How are you going to deal with her? Tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simple. Giselle desperately wants to erase your and Mr. Bryant's past, but I insist on letting everyone know just how much of a good woman he abandoned for someone like her! Madeline, you don't need to worry about this, I am the best at controlling the internet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam mysteriously blinked at me and then went out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know how many photos and videos he had secretly taken while I was working. The side profile photos and front-facing photos of me taken on various occasions were carefully edited and posted online, constantly fueling public opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Full of sincerity was misplaced, after the divorce she wholeheartedly focused on her career, dedicated and beautiful, no longer believing in love. Everyone, look at the photos, guess who she is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It turns out her ex-husband is him! How could he bear to disappoint such a good woman? Let's together delve into their story..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, such a beautiful woman's life was actually ruined by a mistress. Was that man blind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mistress forced them to divorce with her pregnancy. She decisively went to the Courthouse to sever their relationship, and after the divorce, she stood alone, stunning the whole world!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="635.html">« Prev</a><a href="637.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
