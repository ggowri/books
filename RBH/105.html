They soon suggested playing Truth or Dare together. The loser had to either choose to drink alcohol or put ice cubes down their collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gameplay was exciting, and everyone immediately responded, with everyone joining in one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn placed an empty bottle in the middle of the table, and everyone took turns spinning it. Whoever the bottle pointed to, that person had to answer a question, and furthermore, the person answering had to tell the truth, or else they would be cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The game started, and Quinn quickly spun the beer bottle. However, to my surprise, after a few spins, the bottle unexpectedly pointed towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn grinned at me, looking as if he was about to seek revenge for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of everyone, he rubbed his hands together and suddenly asked me a question that was difficult for me to speak out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked me, "Madeline, when was your first time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This problem... is really embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in front of so many people, could I possibly admit that I, a married person for two years, am still a virgin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could never tell anyone about such an embarrassing thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if I didn't tell the truth, I would have to face the punishment of a big adventure. For a moment, I felt extremely embarrassed and wished I could find a hole to hide in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glared at Quinn fiercely and said, "Quinn, can't you stop being so weird?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was laughing uncontrollably at this point: "Please don't tell us that you're still a virgin, are you? If that's the case, then I really have to question Elliott's abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was probably the only one in the entire room who dared to openly question Elliott in this regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Quinn said these words, the others couldn't hold back their laughter any longer and burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you wait for me, retribution will come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I angrily uttered a sentence and then, without saying a word, grabbed the ice bucket on the table and poured it all over myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of the ice bucket being poured all over me was truly bone-chilling and exhilarating. I shivered all over from the cold, and Fiona quickly draped a blanket over me. Then she turned to Quinn and said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Woods, you wait, the next one is guaranteed to be yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After recovering, I picked up the beer bottle on the table and started spinning it. This bottle is really magical, as it spun around, it actually landed on Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The opportunity for revenge has come, and I became excited all of a sudden. I laughed and shouted:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, look, it came!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and Fiona were also excited, and they immediately gathered around me. Then, Paige leaned in close to my ear and whispered:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you just ask him, when was the last time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I understood it in an instant and couldn't help but chuckle. However, I really couldn't bring myself to ask such an embarrassing question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I may appear unrestrained, but deep down I am still somewhat traditional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige saw me smiling mischievously but didn't ask any questions. So, she casually said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I'm here to ask questions on behalf of Madeline. When was the last time you did something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, as always, was a regular at nightclubs. She asked these questions without any shame, effortlessly. I truly admire her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Paige asked this, several men instantly burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip couldn't help but joke, "Do I even need to ask? Quinn was definitely partying every night, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone immediately turned their gaze to Quinn, and everyone was particularly eager to see what kind of answer he would give...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="104.html">« Prev</a><a href="106.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
