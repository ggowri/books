However, after only a few seconds, he turned his head and went in another direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just mentioned the heart at the throat, and it instantly sank. I thought he was going to come over again, but unexpectedly, he didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were clearly a couple, and there had been intense physical contact between the two of us not long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know why, but it seemed like an invisible wall stood between us, and we passed each other like strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were hundreds of people on the scene, and I'm afraid no one would have ever imagined that he and I were a married couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hehe, reality is truly... I don't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you daydreaming about? Did I steal those young male actors from you and make you unhappy?" Paige noticed my distraction and jumped to my side, saying with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I was just feeling a little nostalgic," I shook my head and quickly snapped out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's go over there and have a cup of coffee," Paige pointed to a coffee shop that was open in the film and television city, indicating that I should join her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, we walked into the coffee shop hand in hand, and after each ordering a cup of coffee and a pastry, we found a seat by the window and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, there's something I want to ask you," Paige said, looking at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter?" I asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there no longer any feelings between you and Quinn?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect her to suddenly ask me this question, and for a moment, I was extremely surprised. "Ah? Why do you say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That night, Philip told me everything. He said he had never seen Quinn act like that for any girl before, so..." Paige hesitated, and didn't continue speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly understood which night it was. I immediately smiled and said, "How is that possible? I am a married woman, and he is a wealthy second-generation. It's impossible for him to have any thoughts about me. You guys are thinking too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I was surprised by Quinn's kindness towards me in this life, I never thought about romantic feelings between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in my opinion, this was unlikely to happen, so there was nothing to think about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe not, sometimes love is a mysterious thing, I also think that his gaze towards you is different from how he looks at others," Paige said while sipping her coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found it a bit strange, when did she become so close with Philip? So I jokingly asked, "Tell me, what's the deal between you and Philip? How did he end up telling you all this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just made a joke casually, little did I know that Paige's expression instantly became unnatural. "Him and I, we're just friends, you know me, I'm a playful person, and coincidentally, he is too. So, playing around, we became good friends!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all there is? Why am I feeling a bit skeptical?" I continued jokingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, speaking of you and Quinn, how did we end up talking about me and Philip?" Paige immediately changed the subject. Then she continued, "If I think you and Elliott are not a good match, just end it early, don't drag it on. It's not good for you. A woman's youth is only a few years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was probably an open secret in the circle that Elliott didn't love me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Quinn persuade me to break up, but even my best friend came to persuade me to break up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it's not just about getting married, is it? Separating is not that simple," I chuckled. Unlike their urging to separate, I wasn't in a hurry in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because in my heart, there was still something that truly made me unhappy, and that was Giselle.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="146.html">« Prev</a><a href="148.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
