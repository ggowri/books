It feels like you've disappeared lately."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we've been calling you to hang out, but you never show up. Heard you snagged a really rich husband, is that for real?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, show us. We want to know who he is."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's arrival transformed the atmosphere into an unexpectedly lively one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several girls surrounded Giselle, treating her like the star of the party. They showered her with compliments, each one trying to outdo the other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I happened to be facing them, witnessing their interactions clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle sat among them with a smile, radiating immense happiness. She pulled out her phone, seemingly showing them a photo, passing it around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a picture of him and me. Take a look, he's not really a rich husband. He's just been a good brother to me since we were kids..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "A good brother since childhood. It's Elliott, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Elliott has already taken photos with her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How far have they progressed?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost couldn't contain the anger bubbling inside me, ready to stand up and find out what was going on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Quinn grabbed my hand, signaling me with his eyes not to act impulsively.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whispered, "Let's hear what she has to say first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had almost risen from my seat. Quinn's words made me suppress the restlessness within and sit back down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, he's so handsome, way more than Rowan! How can there be such a good-looking man? And he looks so classy too!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, dressed head to toe in designer labels, looks so wealthy. Giselle, have you two made it official yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tsk tsk, just now they were saying Giselle is marrying into a wealthy family. Seems like it's true. Giselle, so envious of you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These girls examined Giselle's phone closely, followed by a chorus of exaggerated praises. Meanwhile, my heart grew even more restless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their descriptions, I was certain they were talking about Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glared at Giselle, who was lost in the adulation, completely unaware of my presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she pulled a set of keys from her bag and discreetly placed them on the table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A guy noticed and exclaimed, "Giselle, aren't these McLaren keys? Oh my god, are you driving that car now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's smile brightened even more at the mention of the car. She pretended to be coy, tucking her hair behind her ear, and chuckled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This car isn't mine. Elliott just thought the commute was too far for me, so he lent me this car for now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the girls exclaimed, "Wow, so your boyfriend's name is Elliott? Could it be Elliott, the CEO of Bryant Group? He's the youngest and most handsome CEO in Hoswich, my goodness!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle joined Bryant Group right after graduation. It must be Elliott, the CEO of Bryant Group. It's only you who didn't know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, now that you have such an amazing boyfriend, are you going to look down on us?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle said with a smile, "How could I? No way. I'm not that kind of person. If you ever need help in the future, just let me know. I'll definitely lend a hand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in the center of the crowd, Giselle picked up the drink in front of her, feigned elegance as she took a sip, and then set the glass back down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I watched her act so coyly, the flames of anger were close to bursting through my skull, ready to erupt.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="325.html">« Prev</a><a href="327.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
