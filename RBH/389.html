She gave me the once-over, clearly clocking me heading towards Giselle's ward, and it put her on edge. "You were just with Giselle, weren't you? What's the deal?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? I'm here to see my dad, you're reading too much into it." I shot back, pulling off my sunglasses and shooting Laura and Nicole a cold look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to get sucked into a conversation and make things worse. So, I brushed past them and headed straight for the elevator.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Laura grabbed my hand, her tone frosty. "Hang on, you said your dad's here too? Why didn't Elliott tell me about this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave her a look, seeing the disgust written all over her face, and replied sharply, "Elliott sorted it. Guess he forgot to loop you in. Sorry, gotta run and be with my dad. No time to chat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't even want to think of Laura as my mother-in-law at that moment, let alone stand there dealing with her crap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the elevator doors opened just then, and I slipped inside, heading straight for my dad's floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still a bit soggy from the rain, and my makeup all washed out. If I showed up like this in front of my mom, she'd flip and start asking a ton of questions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dad's doing better now, thanks to Elliott's doctors sticking to their plan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Elliott made sure security around the ward was solid, so I could relax knowing no randoms could just barge in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dashed over to the doctor's office to check up on my dad's condition, then swung by home to change into something more chill before heading out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I arranged to meet up with my old buddy, Ken Murphy, at a cozy restaurant with a private room. It had been ages since we'd hung out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Ken showed up in the private room, rocking a braided hairstyle. We both took off our masks and grinned at each other when we saw each other's faces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you haven't aged a bit! Still looking slim and stunning!" Ken exclaimed as soon as he saw me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aw, come on, I'm pushing thirty now, not as sprightly as you," I laughed, jumping straight into the convo. "Been seeing all these scandals blowing up in the entertainment world lately. Your studio's handiwork?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ken and I used to be gaming buddies back in the day. We'd conquer virtual realms together. Even though we didn't hang out much in person, we had a tight bond forged through countless hours of gaming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But life took us on different paths. I got married and left the gaming scene, while Ken shifted gears from gaming to entertainment journalism. His knack for sniffing out celeb dirt quickly made him a big shot in the industry. He even started his own studio.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We hadn't stayed in touch much over the years, but I still had his digits. So, this time, Ken was the first person I thought of.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="388.html">« Prev</a><a href="390.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
