He held my hand firmly against his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel the heat radiating from his chest, his palms equally as warm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze burned into me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I simply couldn't bear such a gaze, so I had no choice but to dodge desperately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did I know, he seemed to anticipate my evasion, deliberately holding my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you used to always say that I didn't care about you, didn't you? What about now? Can you feel it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um, but..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I initially wanted to say "but it's too late," yet considering his illness, I held my tongue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are no buts, Madeline. I want you to know, you're the only woman who's ever truly touched my heart."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only one, huh?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has he forgotten about Giselle Cole? Has he forgotten how he hurt me because of Giselle, in the past life and this one?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't respond to his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found my heart surprisingly stirred by his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled me into his embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I carry a faint scent of gardenia, a fragrance he had specially concocted for my body wash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed himself close, taking a harsh sniff at the crook of my neck. His breathing instantly turned ragged.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cradled my face, his handsome, compelling features leaning in, clearly intending to kiss me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flurry, I tried to stop him, simultaneously placing my hand before his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me, a flicker of disappointment flashing quickly in his eyes, and said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all this time, you're still not comfortable being affectionate with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I've been feeling really drained lately, can't seem to muster any enthusiasm. I think I'll head to the guest room to sleep, that way we can both get a good night's rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I feared that if things continued this way, disaster would strike. So, I immediately prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't stop me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pride, evidently, was wounded amidst my repeated rejections.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment I swung the door open and stepped out, I heard his soft sigh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I paused in my stride, but didn't linger. I dashed off to the guest room and shut the door behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dreamt that night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dreamt of the moment when I was taken away by those people back in Ruini.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my dream, I was crying out in desperation. The sky was still thundering, with bolts of lightning slashing down. I saw a horde of menacing figures, brandishing their knives, intent on ending my life. I was retreating helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just then, Elliott came roaring in on a dirt bike. He quickly helped me up, draping his jacket over my shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he fiercely battled it out with that bunch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my dreams, I saw him being slashed again and again. I watched as the blood poured relentlessly from his wounds. Yet, he kept rising, battling those brutes, his body marred with countless scars.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he collapsed beside me, his body drenched in fresh blood. Blood was everywhere, flowing like a river.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott! Elliott!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was terrified, screaming his name as I jolted awake from my dream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was tightly enveloped in a pair of sturdy arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that I realized it was a dream, and by the time I woke up, I was drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="879.html">« Prev</a><a href="881.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
