Who is ringing our doorbell?" Lily said suspiciously, then quickly stood up and walked towards the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also found it strange. Just then, Lily looked through the peephole and immediately opened the door, surprised, saying, "Quinn, why are you here so late?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Lily, Merry Christmas! I brought fireworks and wanted to invite you all to watch them together! Is Madeline here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's excited voice came from outside before Lily welcomed him in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline is home tonight, and Marcus is also at my place tonight, so your timing is perfect! I just prepared some wine! Come on in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, I saw Quinn coming in from the door, wearing a white down jacket and a smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, so many people at Uncle Austin's house tonight. If I had known Marcus was here, I would have come earlier to drink with Uncle Austin!" Quinn said as he entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weather outside seemed cold because Quinn's nose was red even though he wore a thick down jacket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, our house had underfloor heating. As soon as Quinn entered, he took off his jacket, and Lily took it and hung it on the hanger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wearing an orange round-necked sweater and dark gray jeans, Quinn looked full of energy, like a recent college graduate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because he had met my parents a few times before, he appeared relaxed rather than reserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once seated, Quinn immediately picked up a glass, poured himself some wine, joined Austin and Marcus, and started drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In recent years, Austin had been lacking drinking buddies. We rarely drank with him before, and even when we did, it was only a small amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with two young people in the house, Austin could finally enjoy drinking without restraint. His face was flushed with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Quinn's arrival, Lily went to the kitchen again. First, she brought out a plate of sandwiches for Quinn, followed by several dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a long time since we had so many guests at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's cheerful personality instantly livened up the atmosphere and made it feel more like Christmas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they chatted happily, Lily joined in the drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't drink alcohol, so I substituted with a soft drink and chatted with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Christmas, and everywhere, on TV and outside the window, there was a festive and peaceful atmosphere, making everyone's spirits inevitably uplifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, I told Austin about the upcoming collaboration between me and Marcus, which made him even happier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at me contentedly and said to Quinn and Marcus, "You don't know, I always wanted Madeline to take over the family business. But she's a girl, and I didn't want her to work so hard. However, Madeline has proven herself capable. She's only been in charge of the company for six months, and she has already shown great progress in the business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn immediately chimed in with a smile, saying, "Madeline is smart and has a strong ability to learn. Uncle Austin, you can rest assured handing the company over to her. If she ever can't handle it, I can come to Glory Group to work for her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This remark brought laughter from everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then added, "Madeline was always smart during school. She used to wake up late every day, but she always ranked at the top in exams. I always said she would have a bright future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both kept praising me, making Austin and Lily burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh and said, "Alright, stop praising me so much, you're making me blush. Thank you so much for your help. I will still need your assistance in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't need to say thank you between us. Whatever happens in the future, as long as I can help, I will definitely lend a hand!" Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="487.html">« Prev</a><a href="489.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
