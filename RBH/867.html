I'm at a loss for words. All I can do is pull my coat tighter around me and say in a low voice:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's nothing! I've just been a bit worn out lately. Plus, your parents keep pressuring us to have kids, so that's been weighing on me. You go ahead and sleep, I'll head to the guest room."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I decided to use his parents as an excuse. Then, I quickly retreated to the guest room and shut the door behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there I was, tossing and turning in the guest room bed, sleep eluding me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene of kissing Elliott kept replaying in my mind, over and over, like a movie on loop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to sleep, I found myself mindlessly scrolling through Facebook on my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott updated his status, accompanying it with a picture of the starry night sky, captioned with a string of ellipses.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to quell the desires within, he found himself on the rooftop terrace in the middle of the night, stargazing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The feeling of love and joy between a man and a woman, it's just too fantastic! Amazing!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the besties group chat, Paige suddenly let out an exclamation, followed by a ridiculously laughing emoji.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh, quickly replying to her: "What on earth are you on about in the middle of the night?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige immediately shot back with a devilish grin emoji, followed by a snapshot of her bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photo featured a hunk of a man. His back was turned to her, his muscular upper body bare. The man looked like he had just fallen asleep after a passionate encounter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seems like Paige is back to her old live-in-the-moment self.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My response: Are you dipping your toes in the dating pool again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly shot back a message: Why bother with love? Just enjoy the physical pleasure. Why let emotions dictate you?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems she's finally moved past her old heartbreak, returning to her former self.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but chuckle, about to put down my phone. Unexpectedly, Fiona, who's always been a stickler for routine, posted a photo too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Paige's photos, hers were much more subtle. Her pictures featured two hands, tightly interlocked, resting on the edge of a pillow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it's merely two hands, the image leaves a vast space for imagination, creating a stunning effect, akin to a depth charge.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My curiosity with Paige was ignited, wildly cueing her in the group chat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona, what's the deal? Who have you been sharing a bed with?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh my God, you're not dating Mr. Knight, are you?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it still going on? How's it feeling?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How good is Mr. Knight's technology?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In our trio's bestie chat, we were grilling Fiona with all sorts of R-rated questions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took Fiona a while to respond, finally sending back a bashful emoji. She followed it up with a few words: "It's with Mr. Knight, not bad at all, more impressive than I imagined."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's so Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few words, yet they open up a vast realm of imagination for us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and I started bantering like mad, pushing the boundaries further and further. Already unable to sleep, I was now more awake than ever...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't sleep a wink all night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, as I descended the stairs, Elliott was already dressed and seated downstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With dark circles under my eyes, I walked over to him, only to find his eyes equally bloodshot, a clear sign of his exhaustion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of us locked eyes, and inexplicably, we both burst into laughter at the same time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why bother?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently patted my head, smiling with a sense of helplessness.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="866.html">« Prev</a><a href="868.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
