If he truly cared for you, why confine you to a mere employee position at Bryant Group? That incident when you wanted to play the piano, the way he looked at you didn't seem as intimate as you claim."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still couldn't believe it, still desperately trying to find the loopholes in her words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, with her spirited demeanor, Giselle resembled a victorious peacock, making her contemptuously smirk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott had me start as an assistant because he wanted me to build up from the grassroots. He didn't want to appear too close to protect me, to prevent the entire Bryant Group from knowing about our relationship. As for that piano performance, if it weren't for your sudden interference, I wouldn't have been so wronged at Bryant Group."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Only when someone truly cares for another will they pave the way for all her future endeavors, quietly providing all the protection she needs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turns out Elliott's favoritism towards Giselle has reached such heights.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has never cared about my life, never deliberately shielded or protected me, not even remembered my birthday. Yet, he is so concerned about Giselle."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's the purpose of you telling me all this today?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though my brain was in turmoil from her provocations, something just didn't feel right.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Why is she so eager to meet me all of a sudden, and why is she rushing to disclose all this to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There must be a reason behind it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle suddenly smiled, her visage lovely, but her smile felt particularly menacing at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle pulled out a piece of paper from her bag, which appeared to be a report. Then, she handed me the paper, sneering, "Despite all your scheming to marry Elliott, your body doesn't give you the chance. The medical report shows you have severe endometriosis, rendering you infertile. You can forget about bearing Elliott's child for the rest of your life. And, Cormac already knows this fact."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left me breathless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively picked up the paper, seeing my name on it. The conclusion of infertility at the end of the report made my body tremble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never undergone such tests in the past and never had any health issues.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, to my surprise, I was diagnosed as congenitally infertile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "But this can't be right. Could the test be wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My hand holding the report trembled incessantly, and at that moment, I suddenly understood why Giselle had told me so much today. This fact had unleashed uncontrollable joy within Giselle, prompting her to rush over and reveal this result to me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you get my report? Did you fabricate something?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still very puzzled, raising my head to stare at her intensely.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="253.html">« Prev</a><a href="255.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
