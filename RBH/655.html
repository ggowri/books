However, Laura strongly opposed it, fearing that amniocentesis would harm the baby. She even threatened to die, so he had to give up. Giselle had already gained the trust of the Bryant family, and they were eager to have a child at the time. Her IVF was also done in the Bryant hospital, so the Bryants believed that Giselle was innocent and kind. They would never have thought that she would secretly collude with Doctor Louis to deceive them. When the child was born, the facial features of a Down syndrome child were naturally different from others. Even if the child did not resemble Elliott, they would not suspect anything. The Bryant family would only think that the Down syndrome was a disadvantage caused by IVF and would not suspect that Giselle had done something wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After your analysis, even I am impressed by Giselle's courage!" Paige exclaimed in disbelief upon hearing me say that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She didn't follow the usual procedures, and if it weren't for Madeline discovering the clues, she would have truly succeeded. However, Madeline, you better thank me properly. If it weren't for me working at the hospital and having convenient access, helping you obtain the child's personal information, we would have all really been deceived by Giselle this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona smiled and winked at me. What she said was true. Indeed, Fiona worked there, or I wasn't able to obtain the results of the paternity test that smoothly this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can only say that she has done too many bad things and will surely bring about her own destruction. I just don't know how the Bryant family, who is laughed at by others, will treat Giselle next," Quinn said at this moment. And as soon as he finished </span><span>speaking, the door of the room was suddenly slammed open again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just been talking about Giselle when she arrived. None of us had expected that Giselle would suddenly burst into the room, shouting anxiously, "Elliott, Elliott! I know you're here, you ... you have to listen to me and let me explain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the waiter hurriedly followed in and explained, "Mr. Woods, this woman was shouting to see Mr. Bryant. No matter how hard we tried to stop her, she insisted on barging in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn waved his hand, signaling the waiter to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle quickly looked around. When she realized that Elliott was nowhere to be found and it was just a few of us, she first looked stunned, and then glared at me angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why is it you? Where is Elliott? Where did he go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, at this time, was still wearing the luxurious dress she had worn at the engagement ceremony. However, the once graceful swan-like figure at the venue had now transformed into that of an ugly duckling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dress was stained all over, and Giselle's hairstyle was also in a complete mess, not to mention her makeup, which was truly appalling. She looked particularly disheveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't stay at the venue for too long, and I had no idea what happened at the venue after I left, let alone how the Bryant family would treat Giselle. So, seeing her appear here at this moment, I was also very surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Cormac was about to pass away, and the Bryant family must be very busy and chaotic now. They probably didn't have the energy to deal with her now, so Giselle was anxious to find Elliott, trying to salvage the situation again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His grandfather was about to pass away. Weren't you always the closest to his grandfather? How come you didn't know?" I looked at her panicked expression and said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="654.html">« Prev</a><a href="656.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
