I watched helplessly as that part grew larger and larger in front of me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was utterly embarrassed, my heart pounding wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was probably the most awkward situation I had ever encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he quickly realized it was inappropriate and moved back a bit, giving me some space to hurriedly stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood there, stunned, leaning against the wall, my face burning red. I didn't dare look him in the eye, and my breath caught in my throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing my embarrassment, he deliberately lifted my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had that smile, his black shirt with a standing collar making his neck look especially long. During our escape, a few buttons had popped open, adding to his allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, he's gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned close to my ear and whispered, his breath tickling me slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart was still racing with lingering fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm visiting family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, then suddenly lifted my chin again. His breathing grew heavy, and his Adam's apple bobbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could sense the desire in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively felt something was wrong and tried to pull away, but then I heard noises outside again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to be the same group of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe they had come back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through me. Before I could speak, the man's lips were on mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His kiss was sudden and forceful, filled with a familiar, long-missed dominance, invading my mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't even react as he pinned my hands above my head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he suddenly yanked down my halter dress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the dress fell to the floor and was quickly kicked under the fitting room bench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gasped in shock, but with my lips sealed by his, no sound came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the fitting room door was pushed open again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a tattooed man barging in. He grabbed the man's arm, trying to get a closer look at us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrified, I clung tightly to the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my dress gone, I was left in just my bra and underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the tattooed man came in, he would see everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made my skin crawl with goosebumps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, the man suddenly shouted something in Korean, scaring the tattooed man into pulling his hand back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what he said, but the tattooed man hesitated, looked at us, then backed out and even closed the fitting room door for us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't dare move, nestled quietly in the man's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest pressed tightly against mine. With the heat and close proximity, our sticky bodies made the atmosphere incredibly intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could feel his heart beating strongly in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips were still pressed against mine, soft and jelly-like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea what the tattooed guy said, but those people quickly left the clothing store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their footsteps faded, the man, as if reluctant to part, suddenly brushed his tongue lightly across my lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was incredibly seductive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a shiver run through me as if my soul was being pulled out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart pounded even harder, and instinctively, I clenched my fist and punched him hard in the chest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grunted and finally pulled away from my lips, catching my fist and gently kissing the back of my hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, are you crazy? You took off my clothes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally able to breathe, I protested in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I didn't, they'd recognize you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, bending down with an effort to retrieve my dress from under the stool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was filthy under the stool, and the dress was covered in dirt, making it unwearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was speechless and gave him a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait here, I'll ask the owner for a new one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott quickly put on his pants, buttoned his shirt, and walked out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I waited quietly in the fitting room, my mind replaying everything that had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't remember the last time I had been this close to a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about Elliott's passionate kiss and the strong scent of his masculinity, I felt a wave of heat rise within me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was happening to her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was I actually having a physical reaction?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing I was having such impulsive thoughts, I felt even more embarrassed, wishing I could disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was chatting with the owner in Korean, and they seemed to be getting along well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Elliott returned with a light pink dress, opening the fitting room door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't even look at the style, just wanted to end this awkward situation quickly. I changed into the dress and hurried out of the fitting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a large mirror in the store, and as soon as I stepped out, I saw my reflection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from my messy hair, I noticed that Elliott had great taste. The dress was stylish and fit me perfectly, making me look refreshed and youthful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The owner gave me a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear she thought Elliott and I were a desperate young couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze made me blush even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott quickly paid and chatted with the owner a bit more, and I could tell from my limited Korean that he thanked her and even gave a tip on top of the dress's price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just in case, he also bought a set of clothes for himself, though the store mainly sold women's clothing and had few options for men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long search, he reluctantly chose a gray T-shirt and a pair of simple beach shorts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the simple style, he still exuded a rare elegance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the owner couldn't help but give him a thumbs up, praising his good looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly paid again, then took my hand and led me out of the store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as we stepped out, I looked at the narrow alley in confusion and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know either; I'm not familiar with this area."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had assumed he knew the way since he had led us here so quickly, but his words surprised me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to him in shock, and his expression suddenly became serious. He whispered urgently:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh-oh, they're back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?
