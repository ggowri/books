His words caught me off guard, and I shook my head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all the groundwork you've laid in secret, and with the airing date so close, would you really agree to reschedule? Elliott, I don't buy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, grabbed my shoulders, forcing me to meet his gaze. He looked at me, his deep eyes sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll admit I've had thoughts of competing with you before, but now, I've had a change of heart. While commercial interests are important, they pale in comparison to our relationship. I just want you to know that I'd do anything for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's sudden confession shook me to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite years of seeing his aloofness and superiority, I had never witnessed this sincere and affectionate side of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would do anything for me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I admit I was moved by his words. However, in the next moment, I thought of the child in Giselle's belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, all the emotions in my heart turned to nothingness. I gave him a cold smile, pushing away his hands and keeping my distance from him once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? If that's the case, then have Giselle give up having the child. Perhaps then, I could pretend like nothing happened and try to continue this relationship with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I said those words, they were indeed filled with indifference and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I distinctly noticed, when I uttered those words, Elliott's eyes widened slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably hadn't expected me to say something so cruel. So, for the first time, he fell silent as his gaze dimmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't mean that, did you? It shows you still care about her. Elliott, you know better than I do what is really going on between you and Giselle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his reaction, my heart sank even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, despite his growing affection for me and his repeated assurances that there was nothing between him and Giselle, many things subtly hinted that their relationship was not simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't confront him because I was tired. I didn't want to keep questioning him about one thing after another. I didn't want to become that crazy and hysterical woman again, entangled in the love world between him and Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My grandpa and parents are convinced that she's pregnant with my child. If I insisted otherwise, my grandpa's illness might..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pondered for a long time, and just as I turned away, he suddenly spoke slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, he brought up Cormac as an excuse. And I admit, this excuse was one I couldn't refute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it wasn't wrong for a terminally ill old man to want to see his great-grandchild before he passed away. The fault lay solely in my uncooperative body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't turn around, but just let out a cold laugh as I left the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still clothes in the wardrobe that I hadn't taken with me back then. I pulled out a set, about to change when I suddenly smelled a familiar perfume scent from that outfit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't a perfume I would use, but rather one that Giselle often wore.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="411.html">« Prev</a><a href="413.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
