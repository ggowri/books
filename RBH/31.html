He actually abandoned me on a remote mountain road, disregarding the fact that I was a weak woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he really not afraid that something would happen to me here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or perhaps, in his eyes, my life was simply not worth mentioning at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously looked around. The pitch-black cedar trees were like one giant ghostly figure after another, making me, who was always afraid of the darkness, can't help but shiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly took out my phone and turned on the flashlight, quickly checked the location, and found that I was still on that short section of mountain road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But fortunately, I would be able to reach the main road if I walked another mile ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was already late, and it was impossible for me to walk back as the city was still several hundred miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to avoid any unexpected situations, I quickly walked forward while immediately dialing Paige's phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was around 10 p.m. After Paige answered the phone, music blared over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that he was at the nightclub again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, what happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, I'll send you my location. Hurry and find someone to pick me up. Elliott left me stranded in the suburbs, and I don't have a car to get back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Elliott is damned. Send me your location quickly. I'll come over right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paige heard it, she immediately exclaimed loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the phone, I immediately sent her my location. Then, guided by the faint light of the flashlight, I walked forward onto the main road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so late that, apart from the occasional passing trucks, hardly any other cars could be seen on this road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never walked alone on the road so late before. It was impossible for me not to be afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A truck slowly stopped in front of me at that moment. The rough-looking truck driver stuck his head out and whistled at me, asking me where I was going and if I wanted him to give me a ride with a malicious look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was startled and instinctively started running forward. Luckily, just at that moment, a business car came towards me and stopped beside me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it Ms. Mayers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The window of the driver's cabin in the business car rolled down, and a driver who looked very unfamiliar asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Paige ask you to come over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly looked inside, but I found that Paige was not in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car door opened then, and the driver said to me, "Ms. Mayers, please get in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I think Paige might have drunk alcohol, so she delegated someone else to pick me up. It must be true since the driver knew I was "Ms. Mayers".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truck was still parked there, and I felt a little scared. Without thinking too much, I immediately got into the business car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver handed over a bottle of water. "Ms. Mayers, you must be thirsty, right? Drink some water first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat in the car, and at this moment the driver had already closed the door and turned towards the direction of the city center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After walking for so long at night, I was indeed thirsty. I took the water and drank a few sips in one gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver was driving very fast. I felt a little dizzy, and it was at this moment that my phone rang, and Paige's anxious voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, where are you? We have already come over, and we are only 300 feet away from the location you just sent. But why haven't I seen you yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already got in the car. Wasn't the black business car sent by you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked with doubt. However, at that moment, I felt a sudden and inexplicable dizziness. I couldn't hold on and fell onto the back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver turned his head and gave me a sinister look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized that I got in the wrong car, but it was too late. Soon, a stronger dizziness came over me, and I fell into a coma.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="30.html">« Prev</a><a href="32.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
