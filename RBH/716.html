Thank you for your kindness, I appreciate it," I politely declined Elliott's offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our company had a group of professional security personnel, well-trained and physically strong, enough to reassure people. After all, you are in the late stage of pregnancy now, so you should be careful. Don't always keep me at a distance, I already understand your intentions, I don't mean to force you, just... let me make some amends for what I have done to you in the past." he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly turned my body, he gazed into my eyes, and his deep eyes were filled with sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compensate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has he now found his conscience and finally realized the harm he caused me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was forced to look into his eyes, even though he meant well, but I didn't want to appreciate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really don't need it. I can handle my own affairs. If there's nothing else, then I'll drive back first. There are still a lot of things waiting for me to deal with at my company," I said to him as I had already reached the side of the car, pressing the car key to unlock it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's brows furrowed, as if filled with melancholy on his handsome face. He reluctantly released his hand that was supporting my shoulder, and just as I turned around, he suddenly whispered softly from behind, "I have thought about the words you said that day for a long, long time. Regarding the question of love, I already have an answer in my heart. Do you want to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart was suddenly startled by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously turned my head and, coincidentally, met his intense affection in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, my response almost slipped out of my mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, after loving for so many years, I really hoped to get an answer. Elliott, did he ever truly love me from the beginning to the end?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I was about to blurt it out, there was a voice inside me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It has all ended, whether you love or not is no longer important. No matter how you love or not, it cannot change the outcome between us. So, why bother knowing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound kept echoing in my mind as I looked at Elliott. My lips moved slightly, and in the end, I weakly smiled and said, "It's not necessary. The answer doesn't matter to me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned my head again, this time with determined steps, without hesitation, and walked up to the car, directly pulling open the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, whether you believe it or not, I loved you! I have never been so infatuated with a woman before. If this isn't love, then you tell me, what is?" Just as I was getting into the car, Elliott suddenly mustered up the courage and shouted at my back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly froze all over my body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I remember correctly, this was the first time in so long that I heard the three words "I love you" so clearly from Elliott's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also the first time in so long that Elliott told me the answer so confidently and told me that he was obsessed with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned for a moment and my palms were full of sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at the man outside the car window, who had a strong physique and an </span><span>extraordinary aura. It was hard to imagine how much of his former arrogance and unattainable self-esteem he had let go of when he shouted those words at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, I would have definitely been moved, unable to suppress the surging emotions in my heart, and would have thrown myself into his arms regardless of everything, to embrace this belated confession of love, and to eagerly express all the feelings in my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after a brief moment of astonishment, I realized that my heart instantly returned to tranquility, even more tranquil than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't pretend anything, I really let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does Elliott love me? Does he care about me? I really don't care anymore.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="715.html">« Prev</a><a href="717.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
