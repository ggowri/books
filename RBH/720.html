Are you guys planning to take advantage of the opportunity to have some fun over there?" Marcus raised his head and asked me enthusiastically, as he immediately guessed our intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's been a long time since we last went on a trip, ever since the last flu outbreak. And now that the new core management team of Glory Group has been formed, we happen to be planning to invest in Norch City. Why not take this opportunity to go there and have a few days of fun? It's the perfect time, with the warm spring season and the company's current business not being too busy," I said with a smile, and then sat down across from Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The idea is quite good, but I am still worried that your body couldn't handle it," Marcus looked at my belly with concern and said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have been quite stable from pregnancy until now, and all the tests have passed. Plus, I have been taking the medicine you prescribed, so I don't feel particularly tired. It's only a few days, so I should be fine. I will take care of myself. I'm not interested in going out to play, I just feel uneasy if I don't see it with my own eyes," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, you were born with a hardworking fate. You always have to do everything by yourself. How many women get pregnant and work as hard as you?" Marcus looked at me, unable to help but laugh and cry, his tone filled with a brotherly indulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no way around it, time is tight and the tasks are heavy. Now, the film and mechanical projects at Glory Group are basically running smoothly. If the pharmaceutical field can also gradually stabilize, I can relax and step back behind the scenes, and focus on spending a few years with my children and parents," I said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my mind, I had already planned my life for the next few years. While it is important to focus on my career, I also do not want to neglect the company of my family in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin has been greatly affected by the last car accident, and his physical fitness has declined significantly. Lily has also recently felt much older, and our unborn baby in my belly also needs my company and care by my side... In the previous life, I couldn't accompany my parents well, which left me with a lot of guilt and regret. In this life, I don't want to have such regrets again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you're right about that. Once we have developed this department, you can entrust all the business to Jane and manage things from behind the scenes. That way, you won't be so tired. I've been in contact with Jane regarding our business relationship recently, and she's really good. She's very professional and composed, and she handles things efficiently and reliably," Marcus said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, yes, I do think highly of her too. Marcus, you haven't said where would be a </span><span>suitable place for us to hang out," I asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are many places to visit in Norch City, especially famous attractions like Edulet City and the Snow Mountain. Since we are going there, we must definitely go and have some fun. However, the place I mentioned is in Edulet City, where many famous medicinal herbs are produced, and so on. After you have finished exploring, it would be a good idea to go and visit the place I mentioned." Marcus spoke confidently, as he was already very familiar with Norch City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then we can start by joining a tour to visit those famous attractions, and finally go to the Edulet City you mentioned. If we allocate a week for the round trip, it should be enough," I said, feeling a plan forming in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded. "Time is a bit tight, but it's enough. I can recommend a local and professional tour guide to accompany you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="719.html">« Prev</a><a href="721.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
