I bet Jessica is pretty familiar with Elliott too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no. It was just a chance encounter. And to be honest, Mrs. Jessica Woods, given my situation, I really don't want to hold Quinn back. I know he's been good to me. But his love is too heavy for me to bear. I'm afraid I can't reciprocate."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mustered up the courage to bare my true feelings to Jessica.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still looked at me with a face full of tender love:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweetheart, if he's willingly good to you, accept it. When a woman finds a man who truly cares, she should cherish it. Our Quinn has never been this attentive and caring to any girl before. He's genuinely in love, that's clear as day to both me and Carole."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Carole also rested her hand on my shoulder, chiming in, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that stubborn kid has always been headstrong and loyal. We've grown used to it over the years. So, whatever he does, whoever he loves, our family will always back him up. Madeline, don't overthink things, just focus on being with Quinn. To be honest, I'd rather you not get involved with the Bryants anymore. The way they treated you before, they're not likely to change. Keep that in mind."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I initially thought that their visit today was due to them stumbling upon the scene of us three together, and they intentionally came to persuade me to leave Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my utter surprise, they still backed me up with Quinn and told me not to have any reservations about him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This family, they're just too kind, too forgiving. Their words filled me with shame. I can't believe I ever doubted them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moved by their sincerity, I spilled the beans about Elliott's situation and everything that went down in Norch City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They're such a wonderful family, so I wouldn't want to do anything that might hurt them in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After I finished speaking, both of them were utterly stunned for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're saying you can't commit to Quinn just yet, you need to focus on your treatment with Elliott first?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica looked at me, a hint of regret etched on her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he got selective amnesia because he was trying to save me. If I just stood by and did nothing, his brain might get shocked. If anything happened to him, I'd be plagued with guilt for the rest of my life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I whispered softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Madeline," the voice echoed, "don't you think you're sacrificing too much? You've broken up, yet you're forcing yourself back into his life. And what if old sparks fly again? What about you and Quinn..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole asked right away. But perhaps considering my feelings, she didn't go any further.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no way I'm rekindling anything with him. Once the blood clot in his brain is gone and he's back to normal, we won't be in touch anymore. I know what you're worried about. So far, Quinn and I are just friends. I don't want to hold him back. If he finds someone who's right for him, I'll genuinely wish him well."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at Jessica and Carole, speaking with genuine sincerity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've said my piece, and naturally, they understood my point. For a moment, the two of them exchanged glances, seemingly at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, sis, why on earth did you two decide to barge in on Madeline's work?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were in the middle of a chat when, out of the blue, Quinn barged through the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly misunderstood his mom and sister, thinking they were here to give me a hard time. So, when he barged in, his face was a mask of anger.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="806.html">« Prev</a><a href="808.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
