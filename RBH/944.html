What about your parents? Surely your parents wouldn&#x27;t accept it.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">I asked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ll do the thinking on my parents&#x27; side, I guess as long as they get to see Noah every day, what does it matter what Noah&#x27;s last name is? Isn&#x27;t it my son too?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Elliott appeared to be very open-minded, and he saw that I was a bit terrified, so he reached out and hooked my nose.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I could tell he wasn&#x27;t trying to fool or please me, he really wanted to resolve the conflict between my parents and their family today.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Probably he knew in his heart more than anyone that with his family&#x27;s past practices, it was good enough that my family was accepting of them even looking at Noah, otherwise we would have been perfectly justified in keeping Noah completely out of sight of them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I thought carefully about Elliott&#x27;s proposal in my mind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It would indeed be nice for the two families to live in neighboring houses, his parents could see Noah every day if they wanted to, my parents wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about his parents coveting Noah and wanting to take him away, and both parents could grow up with Noah together.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If you really think so, then I can consider it. However, the prerequisite is if we will remarry.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">I emphasized the precondition.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Elliott laughed instantly, and he pinched my face favorably:</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I know, you don&#x27;t have to keep emphasizing it, I know it in my heart, I&#x27;ll try.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">I was in a much lighter mood, I looked around the house, I knew he must have put a lot of effort into the hard and soft furnishings, the house was dripping with speculation about my and my parents&#x27; preferences, my parents were going to love it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And as far as I can remember, with the development of this high-end villa park, all the supporting facilities in the neighborhood are being launched one after another.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It is said that an international school will be built nearby, so children can go to school from kindergarten to high school.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Not only that, the newly developed parks and green paths in the neighborhood are well built, making it a perfect place to raise children.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Elliott took me around the villa, and then I changed into the new clothes he bought for me in the fitting room.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Elliott&#x27;s vision is really quite good, the dress and high heels fit me exceptionally well, and with the diamond necklace that he gave me, I instantly looked expensive.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing that the time is almost up, he took me to drive to the agreed restaurant to eat.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was about six o&#x27;clock in the evening when we arrived at the restaurant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Elliott had just parked the car when Lisa, dressed in an ice blue dress, came out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Elliott got out of the car first, and Lisa probably thought he came alone, so she ran up to him with extra enthusiasm:</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Elliott, you&#x27;re finally here, everyone&#x27;s here, just waiting for you to show up.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">I was still sitting in the car, through the car window, I noticed Lisa who was wearing a dress, she was extraordinarily alluring and voluptuous, through the car window I could smell an ethereal scent wafting over.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ll keep you waiting, you go in first, we&#x27;ll be right in.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Elliott responded lightly, then he went straight around Lisa and around to the other side of the car to open the door for me, and, in a gentlemanly manner, he bowed down and extended his hand to me.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I put my hand on his, and with Elliott&#x27;s thoughtful assistance, I got out of the car.</p><div class="pagination"><a href="943.html">« Prev</a><a href="945.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
