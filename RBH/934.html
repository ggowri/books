margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The front desk of the hotel apologized and explained the situation to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott turned his head, looked at me slightly awkwardly, and tentatively asked me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Is it okay for the two of us to get a room </span><span>......</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was very, very soft, and yet, every word he said was like a mosquito burrowing into my ears, making my ears itch inexplicably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Is there another hotel nearby?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively felt bad, so I subconsciously asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sniffed, and he opened his cell phone and quickly searched, then he said softly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>There are some nearby, but it's just that recently it's the peak tourist season, this hotel is full, and I'm afraid there are no empty rooms in the other hotels either.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously looked at the watch on my hand and realized that the time was already midnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering how crowded every tourist attraction is these days, what Elliott said is indeed possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Let's open one then.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I then said decisively to Elliott without any further hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I said these words, I clearly felt that Elliott's eyebrows raised upwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly and conveniently checked in, and then a bellhop came to collect our bags while I walked with him into the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We were soon in the room we'd gotten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was quiet, so quiet that you could hear a pin drop on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, I had always stayed in this hotel before, but for some reason, at this moment, I felt rushed and had a feeling of uneasiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott also looked unnatural, and even though he was trying his best to hide it, as soon as he entered the room, he consciously stood to the position by the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he was trying to give me space and didn't want to give me a sense of oppression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I really didn't expect that I would open the same room with Elliott again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, I would have been home and with Noah by this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was a little chagrined that I had gotten sick at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat on the edge of my bed and turned on my phone only to realize that my mom had sent me a video of Noah during the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the video, the kid had actually started smiling at people, and, well, he loved to smile so much, and as soon as my parents casually teased him, he immediately laughed, and was so adorably poking out his little tongue, and looked really witty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a little baby is really growing up day by day, and his little fleshy face and meaty hands make me want to kiss him a few times even through the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just missed him so much that I had to click on a couple of his little videos to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, came closer at some point, and just at the moment when I couldn't help but laugh, he whispered in my ear:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Do you miss our son?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he said it made me feel like we'd been together for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The phrase </span><span>"</span><span>our son</span><span>"</span><span> made my heart involuntarily tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to turn off my cell phone screen, but at this time, he took the lead to take the phone from my hand over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then tapped on the video once more, and he watched it lovingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was going to snatch the phone back from his hands, however, just then, I noticed that the corners of his eyes were a little moist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Look how much he looks like me, it's the exact same picture of me as a child.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott murmured, a hint of a nasal tone in his voice, his emotions seeming a little heightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noah looked like him, it was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though my parents had always boasted against their will that Noah looked like me, we all actually knew in our hearts that Noah looked just like Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott opened his cell phone and pulled out a picture of him as a baby and handed it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a picture of him at 100 days old. In the picture, he was sitting on a small sofa in a cute little suit, surrounded by a bunch of toys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he smiled was so much like Noah that it was almost like a picture of Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned and couldn't help but sigh:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Oh my god, it's really exactly the same.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Of course, my son, if he doesn't look like me, who does he look like.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's tone was incredibly proud, he subconsciously reached out and embraced me, and at that moment, my body felt a tingling sensation like an electric shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up at him in awe, feeling even more like looking at him was like looking at an enlarged version of Noah, it really was all the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is probably the magic of blood and genes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, I had always thought that without Elliott's existence, I could still raise Noah on my own, and didn't need to have the role of a father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after hearing Elliott's proud tone of voice and feeling his raw and sincere feelings for Noah, I suddenly felt that I had deprived Noah of the fatherly love he was supposed to enjoy, wasn't I being a bit selfish?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it's not my fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't chosen Giselle and the baby in Giselle's belly, our family would have lived happily ever after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current situation is caused by him and his family, not my responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I thought of this, fire inexplicably rose within me, and I snatched the phone from his hand in one swift motion, and my voice turned suddenly cold:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Noah is my son, your son is still living in the orphanage.Elliott, just because you lost your memory doesn't mean that painful past can be erased. You were the one who chose to give up on us in the first place for the sake of the baby in Giselle's belly, so now, I won't </span><span>......</span><span> either.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even finish my sentence, Elliott had reached out and covered my mouth, preventing me from getting my determined words out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He panicked and said to me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I know that it was me and my family who did the wrong thing in the first place, I also know that you have endured a lot alone, I know, I know all of it.Madeline, I can't change the mistakes of the past, all I can do is to desperately try to make up for them for the rest of my life.Madeline, don't you think that we have become the closest people in this world because of Noah? </span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cupped my face, his voice extraordinarily low the moment he said the last words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closest people in the world </span><span>......</span><span> me and Elliott?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, originally, it was supposed to be like that ah, we had a child together, that child had half of each of our blood in it, we were indeed supposed to be the closest people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why at this moment, he is obviously in front of me, but I can not feel the slightest feeling of that kind of closeness, but feel extremely tangled inside </span><span>......</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know that he is desperately fighting for it these days, and I also know that my heart is gradually loosening up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what he has done for me so far is only prying a little bit of the cold ice inside me, it is simply not enough to warm up my entire being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott, you don't get too close to me, I </span><span>......</span><span> don't feel like we're family now, we're still familiar strangers now.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sanity returned to my brain once again, and I subconsciously pushed Elliott away some distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My head was a little messed up, and that's when my phone rang at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I saw the name displayed on the cell phone screen, I froze </span><span>......</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="933.html">« Prev</a><a href="935.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
