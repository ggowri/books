Since I rarely appear at the Bryant Group, no one knew my identity. However, this was also good as it saved me a lot of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I searched everywhere for Giselle, and finally</span><span>,</span><span> I saw her at the entrance of the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tied her hair up in a high ponytail, wearing a white dress paired with white shoes. She had a small lily-shaped earring on each ear, and a blue employee badge of the Bryant Group hanging around her neck. She looked youthful and full of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Young people didn't really need to dress up, just a touch of makeup was enough. The refreshing and youthful aura was like the elegant and graceful wild lilies in the valley, making people unable to resist being enchanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only Elliott but even I found her very beautiful at first sight of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was probably assigned to the registration desk today. She and another girl of similar height, both dressed the same, were organizing the information on the registration desk, checking and verifying the details of the materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff came in and out of the venue, but she didn't notice me. Meanwhile, I stood quietly on the side, with my hands folded, observing her every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother's flower shop was not big, and Toby was just a driver. I was curious about how she learned to play the piano so well. In theory, her mother should not be able to afford the expensive piano lessons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pondered to myself, when suddenly, someone walked up to me and bumped into me. As a result of this collision, the person accidentally spilled the champagne she was holding all over me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I'm sorry. I was so focused on going inside that I didn't notice you. I apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl who bumped into me quickly apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked down at my clothes and noticed that there was champagne spilled on my left shoulder. It felt icy cold. Luckily, I was going to change into a new dress later, so it wasn't a big problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at the young girl, who appeared to have recently graduated from college, just like Giselle. So, I didn't intend to make a fuss and simply said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. Just be careful when walking. There are a lot of customers today, so especially make sure not to bump into any important guests."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, okay, I will definitely be more careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl didn't know who I was exactly, and she quickly apologized to me. I nodded and was about to leave, but at that moment, a familiar voice came from the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know who I am? Everyone, move aside for me. I am going in right now, and I want to see Mr. Bryant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, miss. The dinner hasn't started yet. We were instructed not to let guests in. You can wait patiently in the lounge over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I had to go to the VIP lounge inside to do my makeup. Do you dare to stop me? Do you know about my relationship with Mr. Bryant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice sounded particularly noisy and harsh, and I instinctively frowned and looked up to see Sylvia at the entrance, wearing a bright yellow evening gown, accompanied by several assistants. She stood aggressively at the door, arguing with the security guard who was blocking her from entering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was so low-key, but unexpectedly, she was very high-profile. She thought she had the power of the Bryant Group just because she had a couple of affairs with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who gave her the courage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger rose in my heart, and then I walked over...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="48.html">« Prev</a><a href="50.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
