In fact, he was capable of loving someone. It was just that in my previous life, I didn't find the right approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, the person he loved might not necessarily be Giselle. Originally, I achieved this thing, which also moved him and made his heart beat faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I looked at Elliott like this, I thought of many things for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obviously didn't know what I was thinking. Seeing me silent, he thought I was uncomfortable and quickly touched my forehead with his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Why aren't you speaking? Are you still feeling unwell? Wait a moment, I will call the doctor immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott finished speaking, without waiting for me to say anything, he immediately rushed out of the ward and shouted for the doctor to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor quickly entered the ward and performed some relevant examinations for me. Then he said to Elliott, "Mr. Bryant, Mrs. Bryant has some cerebral congestion and a mild concussion, with some abrasions on her hands. There are no other major issues. We will arrange for Mrs. Bryant to have a brain CT scan tomorrow. Rest assured, we will do our best to ensure that Mrs. Bryant is fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mrs. Bryant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Elliott has already informed the doctor about our relationship, and judging by the doctor's cautious expression and attitude, it is evident how nervous Elliott was during my unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I guess he was also worried about Giselle like this in his previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know why, but seeing him like this, I wasn't moved. Instead, I always unintentionally associate it with various things from the previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My brain was throbbing slightly, and I couldn't help but hum. Elliott, upon hearing this, immediately bent down and supported my shoulder, asking softly, "What's wrong with you? Is your head still hurting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, there was some discomfort."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, did you hear that? She said it hurts! Is there any way to make my wife not feel the pain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shouted at the doctor again, and he said I was his wife, which left me stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked up at him with an overly nervous expression, and when the doctor heard him say that, he quickly wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor said, "Alright, Mr. Bryant, don't worry, we will find a solution immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't trouble the doctor anymore. Since I had a cerebral hemorrhage, it's inevitable to feel swollen and painful now. It's late, let them rest, I also want to have a quiet moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew it was already late at night through the darkness outside the window, and I didn't want the doctor to be bothered by Elliott again, so I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I said this, Elliott's face finally relaxed. He waved his hand, gesturing for the doctor to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I carefully looked around the ward and found that it was a very high-end private ward. Not only was it well decorated, but also various medical instruments and equipment were complete, making it look very upscale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Elliott attached great importance to it. It must have been deliberately arranged by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also smelled the fragrance of flowers and instinctively glanced at the cabinet beside me, only to find a bunch of fresh lilies placed on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively asked, "Who sent this flower?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Giselle who brought it. After you passed out, she and the head of the construction team called an ambulance immediately and took you to the hospital. Giselle has been feeling guilty about what happened to you. She originally wanted to stay and accompany you, but I told her to go back and rest early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott sat down again and explained in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he held my hand again, spread open my palm, and carefully examined the lines on my palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said again, "I heard that you personally helped move things on the scene, with so many workers there, why did you have to do it yourself? Your palms even blistered..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="159.html">« Prev</a><a href="161.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
