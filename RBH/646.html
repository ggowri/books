However, as soon as I opened my mouth, Elliott stumbled and heavily leaned on my car, triggering the alarm system. The car immediately emitted a piercing sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly hung up the phone. At this moment, Elliott had already seen me inside the car through the windshield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had lowered the seat as much as possible, but he still had doubts. Elliott quickly leaned forward against the windshield, trying hard to take a glimpse inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked directly into his eyes through the car window. Despite the dim light inside the car, he, being alert, understood everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott came over directly and knocked on the car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, there was no doubt that any further concealment on my part would be in vain. So, I took a deep breath and readjusted the seat, then slowly rolled down the car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you... are actually here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott finally confirmed it was me. He couldn't help but shout in a hoarse voice, mixed with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am. I heard that your engagement ceremony was ruined, so I came specially to see for myself, is that too much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My voice was soft, and my tone was calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, everything that was supposed to happen has already happened. I didn't mind if he had guessed that I was the manipulator behind this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I did it, and I dared to admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I guess correctly, the person who made this joke was you, right, Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, gazed at me, and his Adam's apple moved slightly, as if he was suppressing anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I expected, Elliott immediately thought of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. However, you should thank me," I raised my head and mocked, "If it weren't for me, after tonight, you would probably have to be a father to that child for the rest of your life. You wouldn't blame me for ruining your dream lover, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't blame you," he said in a still hoarse voice. "But don't you think the way you went about it was too extreme? By doing this, you undoubtedly turned the Bryant family into a joke in Hoswich city."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott actually blamed me for turning the Bryant family into a joke throughout the entire city of Hoswich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he forget how heartless his family had been to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I smiled coldly and then looked up at Elliott, saying, "Do you only allow the Bryant family to hurt me and not let me fight back? When you all turned me into a joke, did anyone consider my feelings? You, your parents, your grandfather, has anyone ever treated me like family? Elliott, I have been married to you for three years. Three years, even if you raise a dog, you would have some feelings, let alone I am a human being!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could hardly restrain my emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I kept reminding myself in my mind, "I am pregnant, I couldn't get excited, I have to stay calm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being too emotional could only prove that I still cared about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hidden anger in Elliott gradually faded away, replaced by increasingly gloomy emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Opened the door, we need to talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing to talk about," I responded. Presently, I refuse to be alone with him in the same space because I'm afraid I will suffocate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then I will stand here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott probably already knew me well enough, so he didn't persist and instead stood outside the car and said, "When I found out the truth tonight, my first feeling was regret. I regret not verifying the truth of that child at that time, to the point where Giselle used deceit to achieve her goals. If it weren't for that, you and I wouldn't be getting divorced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't care and immediately said, "This is an excuse. If you really want to verify, there were many ways."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="645.html">« Prev</a><a href="647.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
