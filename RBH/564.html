Under his guidance, I quickly familiarized myself with the company's basic operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To groom me as his successor, my father not only shared his knowledge generously but also constantly took me to various events, introducing me to all his connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I increasingly enjoyed this busy yet fulfilling feeling.

Soon, it became known nationwide and was clinically used in major hospitals. It not only effectively curbed the spread of the virus but also brought Tigress Pharmacy Company and the Glory Group to prominence in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much the Bryant Group spent advertising their antiviral oral solution, they couldn't achieve this level of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this victory in the medical field, my Glory Group surpassed the Bryant Group in market value for the first time in history, becoming the top company in all of Hoswich's enterprises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of glory had never been achieved by my father in all the years he founded the Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day Hoswich Financial Magazine announced the rankings, my father was thrilled and repeatedly praised me as a business genius who could accurately seize opportunities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this day, I received a call from Cathy, the chief editor of Hoswich Financial Magazine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, I'm Cathy, the chief editor of Hoswich Financial Magazine.
