I couldn't help but sneeze several times. Despite the car's heater, I felt chills running through my body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know why I vomited so intensely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was because everything the Bryant family did made me genuinely disgusted!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I closed my eyes, involuntarily recalling the fierce and disdainful look Laura had when she slapped me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, there was no familial bond between the Bryant family and me, neither in the past life nor this one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because I initially lowered myself too much, they looked down on me from the bottom of their hearts, underestimated me, and never truly considered me family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously clenched my fists, staring at the grey sky. I silently vowed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, I won't foolishly play emotional games with anyone, nor will I lower myself to please those who look down on me. I must break free from the entanglements of career and marriage and make those who underestimate me regret it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My father was still in a coma, leaving me little time to grieve.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shook my head vigorously, pulling myself out of the low mood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a message popped up on my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[The Bryant Group's first ancient puppetry drama 'Allure' is scheduled for release soon, possibly airing on Netflix's prime time slot...]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this message, I immediately clicked to read the content.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I realized it was just a preemptive move from the Bryant Group. Although the exact release date wasn't confirmed, the fact that they allowed the media to write this indicated they had reached a cooperation consensus with Netflix.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this message, my heart sank, and I couldn't help but think of the previous bet with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I remembered we said that if the ratings of my show "Do Not Love" were higher than "Allure," I could ask for a divorce, and he had to agree.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do Not Love" was currently airing on Netflix's prime time slot, and both the ratings and audience feedback were excellent. If things continued this way, it was highly likely to become the most popular show of the year.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if "Allure" followed closely behind and aired during the holidays, regardless of the timing or the Bryant Group's massive publicity for the show, they would have a significant advantage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, in my past life memories, their lead actress Jezebel, like Audrey, had a destiny to become hugely popular.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, I couldn't help but worry about "Do Not Love."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do Not Love" was my first film and television project, the best way for the Glory Group to quickly generate cash flow, and the first step for the Glory Group to enter the film and television industry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, I had to win this first battle convincingly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, with Elliott unexpectedly challenging me like this, I couldn't let him win.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at the Bryant Group's promotional poster for a long time, feeling more and more familiar with Jezebel's face, as if I had seen her somewhere.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I racked my brain desperately, and just then, I saw a black business car stop at the entrance of Bryant Hospital.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="383.html">« Prev</a><a href="385.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
