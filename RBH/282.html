You don't doubt whether this baby is yours anymore?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and Philip continued their conversation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just too panicked. We've known each other for so long, and I understand what kind of person you are. You're actually quite reserved, and you're not a promiscuous woman." Philip's tone was now calm, providing immense comfort to Paige, who moments ago had cursed him as a jerk. His words were, without a doubt, making her tear up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip quickly pulled her into his embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Elliott's hand continued to stroke my leg. The tingling sensation made me glare fiercely at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't expected Elliott's hand to persist, let alone continue its upward movement without pause.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he crazy? We were in a restaurant, and Paige and Philip were right next to us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, I immediately caught his hand under the table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, instead of stopping, Elliott firmly grasped my hand, pressing it against his own. Then, while holding my hand, he resumed stroking my thigh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter began serving the dishes. I glanced at him in panic, only to meet his smiling eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the waiter present, he showed no restraint. He was clearly doing this intentionally.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy looked so serious usually, and I never expected him to be so flirtatious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he deliberately made me uncomfortable, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, I shifted my legs, avoiding his hand completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, I slipped off my high heels. My right leg, like a serpent, trailed up his legs with my toes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never been so bold and daring before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, scenes like this were commonplace in movies and TV series.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apparently, men loved to see their women in sexy pantyhose, and they would get weak at the sight of that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, I was dressed in a short black dress and paired it with pantyhose tonight. And because I portrayed a devil, my makeup and outfit were quite enticing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Halloween, of course, meant playing your favorite character.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While discreetly rubbing his thigh with my leg, I grinned at him cheekily while resting my chin on my hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected such a retaliation from me. He seemed flustered, whereas a moment ago, he appeared calm and collected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blush on my face gradually faded. My foot stretched even farther, and my smile never wavered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flirting with men turned out to be so much fun. It was no wonder those mythical enchantresses were never tired of it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I watched Elliott grow increasingly flustered, my smile gradually turned wicked. And from his eyes, I could clearly see his burning desires.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip was still comforting Paige at this point. They were obviously lost in their own world, just as Elliott and I were immersed in ours.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dishes on the table remained untouched, indicating neither they nor we had any appetite for food.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know when, but suddenly, Philip and Paige vanished from the private room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at some point, Elliott moved from across the table to beside me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As our lips met, the flicker of desire ignited into an inferno.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, no words needed to be said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we kissed and forgot everything else, Elliott became like a wild beast, hungrily devouring my neck, earlobes, and even my tongue. He seemed eager to consume me whole.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="281.html">« Prev</a><a href="283.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
