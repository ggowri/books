Less than half an hour after I sent my email, he promptly replied, even praising my efforts and encouraging me to maintain my performance. He mentioned having even bigger projects for me in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His recognition of me relieved my anxiety to a certain extent. I paid all my attention to my work in Louis City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know precisely how Elliott communicated with his parents and grandfather afterward. They never called me on the phone again to force me to do anything, and even Elliott never contacted me again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To prevent myself from overthinking, I had to put all my energy into my work all the time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew. Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the final scenes of Do Not Love wrapped, the entire shoot was successfully completed. The actors left after their parts were over, and my work in Louis City, too, came to an end.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona asked around and got me the number and address of the older doctor, Patrick Cullen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And immediately after getting Patrick's number and address, I went to the old part of Louis City on my own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick lived on one of the oldest streets in Louis City. When I arrived there, it was unfortunate that his front door was locked. It seemed he wasn't home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling somewhat frustrated, I wandered through the old street. Unexpectedly, a sudden drizzle began to fall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rushed to find a roof for a temporary shelter. At that moment, I saw a little boy, about four or five years old, shuffling alone in the rain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed unable to locate his parents, crying and howling as he walked. The rain had soaked his clothes. At the sight of this scene, I immediately ran into the rain, squatted down, and held his shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, why are you alone? Where are your parents?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little boy wiped his tears and said, "My parents have gone abroad. I got lost with my grandfather. Can you take me home?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;I quickly picked him up and carried him in a breath to the bottom of the roof, which had just served me as a shelter from the rain. I said, "Tell me, where is your house?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I don't know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this boy was too young to remember where his home was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was getting dark now. I looked around. Perhaps because of the rain, every house on the old street was closed. There were no pedestrians on the road at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you live on this street?" I couldn't help but ask, sizing up at his clothes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little boy was wearing a small jacket with a shirt and jeans. His skin was delicate, and his features were good-looking. He was adorable, not like a child from a poor family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and shook his head, which made me confused, so I asked again, "Then tell me, what's your name?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Byron Cullen. My father is a dentist. My mother is a teacher, and my grandfather is also a doctor," replied the little boy immediately in a sweet voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His last name was Cullen, and his grandfather was a doctor. Could it be that he was Patrick's grandson?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="267.html">« Prev</a><a href="269.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
