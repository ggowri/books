At this moment, Barry and Giselle were already standing at the office door. Giselle was holding a large bouquet of flowers and looking at us in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wasn't my timing right when I came?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had just graduated at that time, so she immediately blushed and became flustered upon seeing this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Mr. Bryant. It was my fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry also blushed. After all, I used to argue with him when I came to see Elliott before. Then, I would leave after Elliott yelled at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Barry did indeed see the scene where Elliott and I were getting along harmoniously for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem. Giselle, why did you bring flowers today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, being very experienced, quickly sat down on the chair calmly and seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, a batch of flowers just arrived at the store. I thought these flowers would be perfect for your office, so I picked a few of the freshest ones and brought them over to you. I even brought a vase specifically for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle placed the large bouquet of flowers in a white and artistic vase and placed it in a corner of Elliott's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my previous life, around this time, I noticed that different flowers would appear in Elliott's office every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Could it be true that I really had no way to prevent this from happening? Are they destined to become closer gradually?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly became irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott walked around his desk and approached Giselle, taking a glance at the flowers on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The flowers are nice. The vase is also very unique. Giselle, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt sad for no reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, I think this kind of flower suits your temperament very well. This vase also happens to match the decoration in your office. I also brought you a small gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle suddenly took something out of her bag and handed it to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That thing looked very familiar. It was the plaster statue of a man and a woman that I saw in Giselle's flower shop that day. In the past, Elliott always kept this sculpture in his office and cherished it greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Giselle to give this plaster statue to Elliott now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Picking up the plaster statue, Elliott furrowed his brow in confusion after observing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, you may have forgotten. Actually, during my childhood every summer vacation, Mr. Jasper Bryant used to pick me up and let me stay at the Bryant Villa for a short period of time. Do you remember me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle looked very nervous. Elliott's eyes instantly lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I remember now! You were the crybaby who stayed at my house during those summer vacations a few years ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! I used to cry a lot back then. You always loved playing pranks on me and giving me nicknames like 'Crybaby'. Now that you remember, does this sculpture remind you of anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle became excited, and her eyes lit up. Elliott and Giselle talked and got lost in memories. I, standing in place, instantly became an outsider again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="91.html">« Prev</a><a href="93.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
