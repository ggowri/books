She adjusted the headrest for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes filled with pity as she spoke, "Poor thing, what happened to you? You were vomiting blood and passed out last night. Our doctors from multiple departments worked tirelessly to save you. You gave us quite a scare! What's going on? Are you feeling better now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's gaze lingered on me, a trace of fear still evident as she gently touched my face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that the gravity of last night's events fully dawned on me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared blankly at Fiona, attempting to speak, but tears streamed down my cheeks uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alarmed by my distress, she urged me to calm down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, please, don't get agitated. I won't ask you anything for now, and you don't have to say anything or cry. Just focus on calming your emotions. No matter what happens, all you need to do is take care of yourself. You need to stabilize your nerves and your heart, alright?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened, Madeline? Why do you suddenly need rescuing? I was so worried that I wandered around all night before finally coming back! Madeline, are you feeling any better?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Fiona finished speaking, the ward door swung open, revealing Paige and Philip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hurried to my bedside, concern etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Paige's swollen belly, I couldn't help but recall Giselle's pregnancy, which made my stomach churn. I signaled to Fiona, who quickly fetched a trash can as I retched.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with her, Fiona? What happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige noticed my distress and patted my back gently, while questioning Fiona.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no idea. Elliott must have irritated her somehow. She was admitted last night in critical condition&mdash;vomiting blood, unconscious, and her heart nearly stopped. It was quite a scare for all of us. But thankfully, she stabilized after treatment. However, she's still emotionally unstable and prone to stress. It'll take some time for her to recover."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona explained my condition in one breath, leaving Paige reeling with shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did that bastard Elliott do to make her like that? I'll go give him a piece of my mind right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just been kicked out of the ward. He's here, Madeline's mood was particularly exciting. "</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona quickly interjected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to find him! That jerk nearly drove me insane. I need answers!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige stormed out, but Philip intercepted her, urging her to calm down for the sake of her pregnancy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't get too excited. It won't be good if you have fetal gas later. You stay here with your best friend, and I'll go to ask Elliott."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're already upset enough. Getting angry again won't solve anything. You'd better stay here with me, Madeline. Let Philip handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona advised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige gave up the idea after hearing Fiona's words. Philip walked out of the ward and left us in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and Fiona exchanged concerned glances, hesitant to disturb me further.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared ahead, my tumultuous emotions gradually subsiding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door creaked open.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then I saw Quinn, dust-covered and laden with bags, walking into my room.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="368.html">« Prev</a><a href="370.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
