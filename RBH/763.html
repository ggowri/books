Her name is Lisa, a good business associate of Mr. Bryant's in Norch City. When Mr. Bryant needed urgent medical attention, it was Lisa who immediately arranged for a private jet to transfer him from Norch City to Hoswich City. Moreover, when Mr. Bryant was first admitted to a small hospital in Norch City, they were running low on blood. Lisa's blood type happened to match Mr. Bryant's, so she donated a significant amount of her own blood to him. That's why... that's why when she offered to stay and take care of Mr. Bryant, both Mr. Jasper Bryant and Mrs. Laura Bryant agreed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I see, that's how it is.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that this woman must be the same one I happened to encounter in the hotel back then. Otherwise, how could such a coincidence possibly exist in this world?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barry, is there anything else you're keeping from me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I locked eyes with Barry, scrutinizing as I asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barry was easily spooked. As I fixed my gaze on him, he began to tremble all over again. Lowering his head, he murmured:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also... also, Mr. Jasper Bryant and Mrs. Laura Bryant said, seeing how much she resembles you, they... they now understand why Mr. Bryant insisted on doing business in Norch City. They also said... they also said that all whores look the same."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, I had this nagging feeling that this woman named Lisa had an agenda. Plus, she was so mysterious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why does she bear such a striking resemblance to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've never heard my folks mention that I had any siblings or close relatives in this world, other than Jade.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, got it. So, she's been here the whole time, hasn't she?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I folded my arms and looked at Barry, my eyes signaling him to lead the way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Barry walked on, he spoke:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, she's been sticking around the hospital, only stepping out a few times to grab some stuff. She's been by Mr. Bryant's side, taking care of him with all her heart."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's so invested in Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's no way she could be taking care of him so meticulously if she had only met Elliott once.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Elliott has had a secret lover all this time that I didn't know about?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A myriad of questions swirled in my mind, but I had no time to ponder. As Barry pushed open the door to Elliott's hospital room, I was immediately taken aback by the multitude of tubes protruding from his body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I arrived, I had imagined Elliott to be severely injured, but I never, in my wildest dreams, thought he would be so hurt that his life would hinge on machines.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lay there, every inch of him seemingly marred and broken. His body was either wrapped in bandages or pierced with tubes. The sight alone was painful, let alone the thought of experiencing it firsthand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him like this, and knowing he was hurt because of me, my heart felt like it was being brutally yanked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I moved closer, taking in the sight of him lying there in silence. A tube protruded from his mouth, a white bandage wrapped around his forehead. His head, shaven due to the injury, bore a stark contrast to his usual appearance. His eyes were tightly shut, as if in deep slumber, and his lips were pale, devoid of any hint of color.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much you despise someone, seeing them in such a state, you can't help but feel a pang of sympathy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart softened in an instant, and I immediately reached out, gripping his hand tightly. Then, I called out softly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott..."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="762.html">« Prev</a><a href="764.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
