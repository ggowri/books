However, he had no intention of doing so.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, I had misunderstood his collaboration with Lisa before. At the very least, from his firm tone, I could sense that he didn't want to be my competitor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was left wondering, Elliott had already hung up the phone by then.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around, catching sight of me frozen in place. Probably reading my thoughts from my expression, he approached me. He reached out, pulling me into his embrace. His warm hand cradled the back of my head, gently caressing it as he spoke:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, the reason I chose to collaborate with the Fox family is because Mr. Fox once did my father a huge favor. Now that he's facing some difficulties in his business, I've invested some funds to help him out. Don't get me wrong, I've never intended to compete with you in the business world."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott explained to me, probably out of fear that I might misunderstand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was only when he said this, I realized, his collaboration with the Fox family was for such reasons.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You invested a billion? That's no small change, mate&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I lifted my gaze to him. If my memory serves me right, the last time we dined with Lisa, she mentioned something about a billion-dollar deal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was merely to repay Mr. Fox for his help, there was no need for him to invest such a hefty sum, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott nodded, his gaze steady, with no intention of hiding anything from me. He said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At first, I didn't plan on investing that much. But after delving deeper, I realized that if these drugs could be successfully developed and produced, they could benefit countless patients. The Bryant Group has already made more than enough money. In the future, I want to focus more on philanthropy, serving the public. After all, that's part of our corporate social responsibility, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott rarely used to chat with me about these things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never lets me in on any of his moves in the marketplace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I can sense that he's willing to share his thoughts with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And hearing him speak like this, I realized, Elliott wasn't the profit-driven businessman I had once perceived him to be. Turns out, he was just like me on the inside, harboring a strong sense of mission and responsibility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We just didn't know each other well enough back then.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surprisingly, we share the same starting point. My investment in Marcus Brown was driven by the same purpose. I know that investing in pharmaceutical bases and researching new drugs isn't exactly a lucrative venture. If I wanted to make a quick buck, I could have easily invested in the booming film and television industry. But I don't want to be just a businessman. If possible, I'd like to do something tangible for the public."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chatting with Elliott, we made our way to the dining table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing my thoughts, he couldn't help but take my hand, our fingers interlocking. The look in his eyes was full of adoration. He said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I never thought our minds would align so perfectly. I know you must have overheard my conversation with Lisa just now. I fear you might have misunderstood, so let me lay out the whole story for you. From now on, anything that might cause you to misconstrue, I'll share with you my deepest thoughts, down to the smallest detail. I won't hold anything back from you anymore, trust me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott has truly changed a lot. Yet, it's unclear whether this transformation is due to his amnesia, or a genuine shift within his soul.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're rivals in the business world, aren't you afraid that if you tell me everything, I might surpass you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, a chuckle escaping as I asked.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="847.html">« Prev</a><a href="849.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
