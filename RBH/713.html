Moreover, it may offend the interests of certain secret forces. Are you sure you're not afraid of getting into trouble? To be honest, when Marcus contacted me, I didn't have much hope. I came here purely because I had a chance encounter with you and because of my relationship with Marcus, so I came to try my luck. If you're only hesitant because of personal feelings, there's no need to worry, I understand." Dalton said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were someone else, knowing that I was willing to invest, they would probably be eager to introduce this movie to me. However, Dalton not only failed to mention the highlights of this movie, but also explained all the possible risks to me one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just for the sake of this character, I am willing to foot the bill for these risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have previously approached many companies in the industry to inquire about investment intentions, and our company has also received the information about this film. Therefore, I have already had some understanding of this film and don't need to ask further. Rest assured. I always do things with reason and evidence. My decision is not solely based on Marcus's personal relationship, but mainly because I have confidence in this film and your directing skills. You don't need to have any concerns. Since we have already started, go ahead and shoot boldly," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, since you trust me so much, I won't say much more. Don't worry. I will definitely do my best to make this movie the best!" Dalton then stopped talking. The two of us quickly reached an agreement and signed the contract on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I decided to cooperate quickly because during my conversation with Dalton just now, </span><span>I suddenly remembered that in my previous life, it was Elliott who invested in Dalton's movie, not someone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I had to act quickly, as I was afraid that if I was one step behind, the collaboration might be intercepted by the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, just as Dalton and I walked out of the restaurant after our conversation, Elliott appeared in front of us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, it has been strange. It's as if he installed a tracker on me, because no matter where I was, he would always suddenly appear in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious that Dalton had previously contacted Elliott, so when Elliott appeared, Dalton was momentarily stunned and then quickly approached, extending his hand to Elliott. "Mr. Bryant, what a coincidence to see you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you guys...? Wait, have you now given up on Bryant Group and chosen to collaborate with Glory Group?" Elliott was taken aback when he saw Dalton and me together, and then he furrowed his brows and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I just signed a contract with Ms. Mayers, I'm sorry, Mr. Bryant, I know you were also considering it, but my film has already entered a critical stage. There are so many people in the crew, and the expenses are huge every day. The longer it takes, the more expenses there will be. I have no choice but to prioritize whoever signs the contract first. I hope you understand." Dalton immediately made an explanation, it seems that everything is indeed as I expected, Bryant Group is also interested in this film.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Dalton's words, a subtle expression immediately appeared on Elliott's face. He nodded, indicating his understanding of Dalton's words, and then he shifted his gaze toward me.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="712.html">« Prev</a><a href="714.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
