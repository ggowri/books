Why did the power suddenly go out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, can bars experience power outages too? Oh my god, there are so many people, don't push me, I'm scared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is it? Who is making a mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>***</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden power outage threw the men and women in the entire bar into a commotion, with occasional screams and exclamations from the girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was pitch black around me, and I felt that there were a lot of people. Everyone was pushing and shoving like a tide, and I almost got knocked down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, a sudden and incredibly strong hand grabbed my wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could fully react, I was pulled into a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but let out a scream, but the other person held onto my hand tightly, showing no intention of letting go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped his arms around my waist and swiftly moved with me in the darkness. At this moment, some people in the crowd had already turned on their phone flashlights, and the bar staff also started to use their flashlights one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shouted at the scene, "Everyone, don't panic. The bar was investigating the cause of the power outage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly brought me to the door, and a gust of wind brought an extremely familiar scent of perfume. When I realized who he was, he simply lifted me up and carried me on his shoulder, and we quickly left the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that he had not left Louis City yet, and moreover, he even appeared in the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, there were so many people, and then the power went out. How did he manage to find my location so accurately and lead me out so confidently?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be... that he just pulled the power switch of the bar?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very confused, and at that moment, I had already been carried by him to the entrance of the bar, realizing what had happened, I couldn't help but struggle desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, put me down! What are you doing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I haven't had enough fun yet! Are you sick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, put me down! Hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I highly doubted if he really had an illness. What was he trying to express?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he expressing his concern for me or his possessiveness towards me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why does he keep making these misleading moves again and again, when he clearly didn't care about me in the first place? What does he really want to do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was extremely speechless. I twisted and turned on his shoulder, however, Elliott was not only domineering but also really strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands clamped tightly around my legs like a pair of pliers, and he hoisted me onto his shoulders like a little pig. No matter how much I struggled, he effortlessly held me down, and he carried me all the way to his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was thrown onto the back seat of the car by him like a piece of merchandise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed up and then tightly closed the car door, roaring at the driver Toby, "Drive, back to the hotel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to stand up from the chair, however, he had already pressed over, his eyes red, his gaze seemingly from hell, which made me shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, I danced vigorously at the bar and now I am feeling exhausted. At this moment, my body is still covered in sweat, and due to the recent struggle, the strap of my little black dress has become loose without my knowledge, with one strap hanging down from my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to tighten my chest to avoid exposing myself, but I didn't expect that he suddenly reached out and pulled forcefully!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the sound of fabric tearing could be heard, and both straps of my black dress fell off. By the time I realized what had happened, the dress had already fallen down to my waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, are you crazy?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="148.html">« Prev</a><a href="150.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
