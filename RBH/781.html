Look at him, with his round little eyes and his pouty lips. He's just too adorable!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mom was speaking excitedly, her eyes constantly lingering on Noah," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My dad, on the other hand, was even more dramatic. He rested his hands on the crib, his face a picture of rapture, as if he was admiring the most perfect piece of art in the world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching their adoring expressions, I couldn't help but chuckle. I quickly made my way over, eager to catch a glimpse of Noah in his crib.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dressed in a soft blue onesie, a tiny baby cap perched on his head. His little hands were waving about, full of energy. His round, curious eyes darted around, taking in the world with an irresistible cuteness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Noah, let mom hold you. I've missed you so much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My heart instantly melted at the sight of Noah before me. I reached out, lifting him from his crib.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I felt his tiny, soft body snuggle against mine, the joy and bliss of motherhood washed over me more than ever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I held him close, unable to resist stealing glance after glance. My mom and dad both gathered around, exchanging words of joy and excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His little pout, it's so much like Madeline when she was a kid. Madeline used to pout just like that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, his skin is just like Madeline's, milky white and absolutely stunning."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His thick head of hair, it's truly a testament to our family's genes."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I reckon Noah's gonna be a handful. Not even a month old and he's already bursting with energy. He's gonna be something else."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it's a generational thing, but the more they looked, the more they fell in love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more my mom and dad discussed, the brighter their smiles became. The three of us huddled around Noah, as if we held all the happiness in the world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps sensing the warmth of his mother's embrace, Noah squirmed in my arms for a bit before peacefully drifting off to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mom told me to put Noah in the stroller, not to let him get used to falling asleep in arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We three settled Noah in, then tiptoed out of the room together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if my mom just remembered her precious little girl, and she knocked on my head in annoyance:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you're driving me nuts, always working and never resting. Listen to me, get back to bed and rest right now. I'll get you something to eat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'm really hungry. I'm gonna go lie down now, thanks!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly responded with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear, you're just as stubborn as your father. It must run in the family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom looked at me, a mix of laughter and tears in her eyes, shook her head in exasperation, and quickly descended the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I no longer feel any discomfort in my body. On the contrary, I feel even lighter than before I was pregnant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this, truly, is thanks to Marcus' meticulous care from the moment I became pregnant to the birth of our child. If we could mass produce the tonics he made for me, wouldn't that benefit more women going through childbirth?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mulled over it as I slid back into bed. No sooner had I settled in than the phone began to ring.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="780.html">« Prev</a><a href="782.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
