He still looked handsome against the neon lights on the street.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked, "If I don't allow you to get too close to her, can you stay away from her for me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, I would never have asked such a question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I had to admit that, during this short period of time, the change in his attitude towards me gave me the illusion that he might start to care about me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to get his preference, which I had never gotten in either my last life or this life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott's response dashed my hopes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said in a deep voice, "Madeline, can you please stop fooling around?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that, in his eyes, my humble begging was just nonsense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of me, he deliberately pretended to be indifferent to Giselle, but she must be very important to him, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, how could he plan to give her a house, buy her a birthday gift, and care so much about her work and life?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I bit my lip but didn't feel the pain, as I was heartbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I responded, "I don't want you to buy her a house or get close to her. Does this count as nonsense? Elliott, you have been so gentle to me these days, are you just pretending?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but question him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew that indifference was the best attitude towards a love rival, but I failed to be indifferent. I admitted that I started to care again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned and looked at me in disappointment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you think like that? You two are different. Madeline, you don't need to mind her existence."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't need to mind her existence?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was his dream lover who could not be slandered by anyone else, so how could I not mind?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing had happened yet, but he had already been so protective of her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to imagine how much he would love her in the near future, but what about me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but think about it. I suddenly felt that there seemed to be no need to say anything more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pushed his hand away, took a few steps back with a sneer, and wiped my tears. Everything that had happened tonight made me feel hopeless again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I secretly laughed at myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did I go to Giselle's house with Elliott tonight, just to insult myself?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I initially thought the love between Elliott and I would stimulate Giselle and make her crazy, but I didn't expect that the person who was stimulated and finally went crazy was myself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had overestimated my position in Elliott's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also underestimated Giselle's position.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me lose my composure, she must be smiling proudly at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't mind. How can I mind? I'm just a woman you've married as a decoration. I think too highly of myself. It's okay. You can go back and buy whatever you want for your dream lover. Buy her a house or clothes. Whatever it is," I sneered, pretending not to care about everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What dream lover? Do you know what you are talking about, Madeline?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned and tried to step forward to hold my hand, but I bounced away immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't come over, Elliott! I don't need your false sympathy, nor your false love. From today on, stay away from me and don't come close to me, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was really afraid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't stand to be hurt by him again and again, and I couldn't bear to have my hopes dashed again and again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with you?" Elliott asked helplessly. "Didn't we have a good relationship two days ago? Why are you like this again?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="221.html">« Prev</a><a href="223.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
