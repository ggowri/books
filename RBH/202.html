The decor was minimalist, just the way I liked it, and it was pretty spacious about 2000 square feet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I then looked around the new apartment and asked in confusion, "What's this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It isn't sanitary to stay in hotels. I bought this apartment two years ago and it's been vacant since. From now on, when you come to Louis City, don't stay in hotels. Stay here instead. The entry code is your birthday," Elliott said with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought to myself, "Oh, so, this was his purpose for bringing me here."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was surprised, but the apartment did indeed look nice. I really liked the style of the decor, and the furnishings seemed very comfortable, especially the floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room that were paired with the white curtains, which looked particularly elegant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked over to the windows and found that they offered a panoramic view of downtown Louis City, which considerably lifted my spirits.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "I've never lived in such a high-rise apartment before, and I honestly found it hard to refuse Elliott's kindness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And these days, although staying in a hotel is convenient, as he said, I indeed feel that the cleanliness of hotels isn't quite up to par, especially since I'm somewhat of a clean freak.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Elliott is willing to let me stay here, I suppose it's alright to move in. After all, we are still married."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, I gladly agreed, "Okay, I'll have Adam help me move my things over. This place isn't too far from the film set anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott responded, "Then, you can use the Porsche. It will make getting around much easier, especially since I rarely drive it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing that I was very pleased with the apartment, a faint smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I toured the living room and then went to check out the bedroom on the second floor. Elliott had bought this apartment for occasional private stays, so the entire first floor, aside from the bathroom, study, and kitchen, was almost entirely taken up by the living room. Meanwhile, the upper level consisted of a bathroom and a large bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really could do whatever he wanted with his money. It was such a big house, yet he only made one bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was very well-lit, the floors were warm-toned natural wood, and the bed was a custom-made genuine leather bed. It was huge, about ten feet wide, and the bedding was all made of really expensive natural silk. The room's walls were a light gray color, with several paintings hanging, and besides that, there were two sofas and a table. There was even a wardrobe that took up an entire wall and a large bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room didn't seem like it had been lived in, so I asked, "Have you stayed here before?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rarely. I sometimes stay here when I'm in Louis City on business, so there's nothing much in this apartment. I'm free today, so let's go to the supermarket later and buy some necessities and groceries," Elliott replied softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's going to accompany me shopping at the supermarket?" I wondered as I turned to look at Elliott in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to imagine that a man of his stature would voluntarily suggest going to a noisy place like a supermarket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my eyebrows and asked with a chuckle, "Sure. But are you sure you want to go with me? You used to hate such noisy places."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pressed his lips together and chuckled, "It's okay. There's not many people here who know me anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I checked the bathroom and then went downstairs to open the fridge and saw that we indeed needed to buy a lot of things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I made a list of what we needed to buy, and then Elliott and I headed out together.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="201.html">« Prev</a><a href="203.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
