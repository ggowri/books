Someone asked me to deliver this to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was feeling confused when the delivery person handed me a bag of something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned. It seemed that someone had sent it to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took the black bag from the delivery person's hand, closed the door, and curiously opened the bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when I opened the bag, the things inside almost scared me to death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I screamed in shock and instinctively threw the bag away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that someone would deliberately play a prank on me by putting a live snake in that bag!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have always been afraid of these long creatures since I was little. I would tremble all over when I was scared, and it would even cause a slight pain in my lower abdomen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened the door as if I had gone crazy, desperately calling for help. Fortunately, the waiter quickly came over and asked me what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I said there was a snake in the room, they immediately called the security and cleared out the black bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was scared to the point of turning pale, my legs went weak, and I still couldn't calm down. Seeing me in this state, the waiter quickly helped me to their lounge and let me rest for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I experienced abdominal pain due to being startled, it didn't take long for the pain in my stomach to gradually disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I leaned on the sofa, carefully thinking about this matter, and increasingly felt that the whole thing was very strange, and it felt very wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just saw in that video that Quinn was surrounded by water snakes, and immediately a delivery person brought a snake... It seems that these two things must have a huge connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, most importantly, that woman actually knew my room number so accurately and acted so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be true that I offended someone by investing in Dalton's movie, just like Elliott said, and now someone wants to harm me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly felt a chilly sensation down my spine, and at that moment, Adam and Jane hurriedly appeared in the hotel lobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw me leaning on the sofa, they immediately ran over, squatting on either side of me, and grabbed my hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Mayers, are you okay?" Jane asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was probably because she was in such a hurry to come back that I noticed sweat on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing, I just got a little scared," I said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, it's a relief that you're okay. We were really scared when we heard the news! I had said at that time that I wouldn't go to the snowy mountain and would stay here with you, but you didn't agree. But now, you have indeed encountered a problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam carefully looked me up and down, criticizing me with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was running out, and I couldn't afford to exchange pleasantries with them. I quickly glanced around and then, lowering my voice, I said to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was fine, but Quinn got into trouble, we must go and save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Jane had not been working in our company for a long time, she often saw Quinn coming in and out of my office, so she also knew who Quinn was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing me say this, both Jane and Adam's faces slightly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam quickly asked me in a low voice, "Madeline, what happened to Quinn? Where is he now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hotel lobby was constantly bustling with people coming and going, making it an unsuitable place for conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I moved with them to Jane's room, and I had already developed a great psychological shadow over my own room, and I dared not step in there again.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="727.html">« Prev</a><a href="729.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
