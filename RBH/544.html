Nevertheless, this did not diminish his handsome appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his hands in his pockets, lips tightly pressed, and brows furrowed, he stood there, not moving a step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle seemed to sense something was amiss. She peeked her head out of the car and tugged at Elliott's sleeve. "Elliott, what are you looking at? Let's go home, I'm feeling tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Elliott, Giselle still maintained her gentle demeanor, and she followed Elliott's gaze towards our direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Quinn and me, a flash of hostility appeared in her eyes. Despite the distance between us, her voice carried clearly on the wind. "Elliott, don't bother looking. She's already betrayed you. She's pregnant with Quinn's child. Just now in the B-ultrasonic room, I saw Quinn's mother accompanying her for the ultrasound. Why hold onto such an unfaithful woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle deliberately added fuel to the fire, and upon hearing her words, the creases between Elliott's brows deepened even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his past demeanor, he would have normally come over and verbally insulted me or Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, not only did he not come over, but he also turned around in front of Quinn and me, took Giselle's hand, and gallantly kissed the back of it. "You're right. I now realize who truly cherishes me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a heavy blow, striking hard at my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I trembled violently, and if it weren't for Quinn holding onto my shoulder, I might have collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After uttering those words, Elliott got into his car and swiftly closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The window was open, and I could see him smiling tenderly at Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doting expression on his face resembled how he used to cherish Giselle in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Giselle had successfully won his heart, and indeed, they were destined to be together, no matter how much I tried to intervene. In the end, he would still fall in love with her, unable to resist showering her with affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their car quickly drove away from the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stumbled, feeling a momentary lack of oxygen to my brain, almost fainting, but fortunately, Quinn supported me in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you okay?" Quinn asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rubbed my temples, shook my head vigorously, and gradually felt my consciousness clearing up a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you see that? He eventually fell in love with her," I said.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="543.html">« Prev</a><a href="545.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
