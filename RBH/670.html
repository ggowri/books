I walked forward and greeted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is the lighting in your hotel bathroom so dim?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other person turned their back to me. Upon hearing what I said, she paused for two seconds and then replied to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because it was close to the cemetery, of course it was dark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence puzzled me a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I didn't think much and just pushed open the door to the women's restroom. </span><span>A</span><span>s I entered the stall, for some reason, the restroom lights suddenly flickered a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, I instinctively thought of what the waiter had just said. It was then that I realized her words seemed to defy normal logic, coupled with the flickering lights, every hair on my body stood on end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, I was in the bathroom and felt a little scared. Can you come over and keep me company?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately sent a voice message to Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sped up and quickly pushed open the door of the compartment, intending to leave this eerie place as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what I never expected was that when I wanted to open the bathroom door and walk out, I accidentally discovered that the bathroom door was locked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was about to press the door handle, a creepy voice suddenly sounded behind me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You scoundrel, you ruined everything for my daughter! How dare you attend the Bryant family's funeral!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sound made me feel very familiar, and, moreover, it was somewhat similar to the voice of the waiter just now, which made me shudder all over, and a chill ran down my spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned around in a hurry. Sure enough, I saw Giselle's mother standing behind me, glaring at me. She was wearing clothes similar to a waiter's uniform. Under the flickering lights in the restroom, she looked like a vengeful ghost. Her twisted face sent shivers down my spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How come it's you? What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the danger, I instinctively took a few steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? What are you saying? You wretched person! Give me back my daughter's life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole glared at me fiercely and then, as if she had gone mad, lunged toward me, attempting to grab hold of my neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, from the moment I saw the door being locked, I was already prepared. </span><span>Just as she lunged toward me, I swiftly dodged and hid inside the compartment where I had just been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole missed her target, and I heard her let out a cry of pain. Immediately after, she once again lunged toward the direction of the cubicle I was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly closed the door of the compartment, however, just as I was about to lock it, she unexpectedly used her arm to block the gap in the door and desperately tried to squeeze in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I tried hard to hold the door, but I couldn't resist her strength, and the space in this compartment was very narrow. Once she succeeded, the consequences would be unimaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't been pregnant, she wouldn't have been my rival at all. But now that I have been pregnant for six months, I wouldn't be able to resist her if she wanted to harm me and my child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of that, I broke out in a cold sweat. Then I tried to talk her out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nicole, I heard about what happened to Giselle, but it was her own doing that led to this outcome. How can you blame me for it? Besides, do you even know what you're doing right now? You're breaking the law! If you come any closer, I will call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the police? Go ahead and call! By the time they arrive, I would have already died with you! You despicable person, it's all because of you that my daughter ended up in such a situation! And you dare to attend the Bryant family's funeral! Even if I lose my life today, I will make sure you pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected it, Nicole, who had completely lost her sanity at this point. She exerted all her strength, repeatedly slamming into the door.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="669.html">« Prev</a><a href="671.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
