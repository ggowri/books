Anyone would find it difficult to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Woods, if you tell lies, you will be struck by lightning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona immediately expressed her protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was even more ruthless, cursing directly, "Mr. Woods, if you lie, you will be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of your life. Think it through."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just played a trick on me, so my several close friends naturally wouldn't show any mercy towards him. Paige's friends also joined in, cursing him with various harsh words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, however, said earnestly, "I am telling the truth, I swear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone opened their mouths in astonishment, even Alexis, who had been silent throughout the scene, was somewhat incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, is it true that we didn't know you were so innocent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn gave him a disdainful look and said, "Please, I have always been virtuous. Besides, I have very high standards when it comes to love, not just any woman can catch my eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said these words, but his eyes were looking at me. The burning gaze made my heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He talked and talked, why was he looking at me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be possible that he still liked me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Don't joke around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly averted my gaze, and Quinn immediately withdrew his gaze as well. He began to rotate the bottle on the table, and at that moment, the bottle pointed towards Alexis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won't play truth or dare this time. Let's use this spinning wheel instead. Whatever instruction the pointer on the wheel points to, everyone must follow it. How about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Quinn finished speaking, he took out a colorful small spinner with some instructions written on it that could make people blush and their hearts race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively expressed refusal, but I didn't expect that all these friends around me were actually very open-minded, and they all expressed their willingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no choice but to obey the majority, so Quinn directly spun the color wheel. Unexpectedly, the instruction displayed on the wheel this time was "kiss the person sitting directly across from you for 30 seconds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone burst into laughter instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in front of Alexis, there was Fiona.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Fiona excitedly waved her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not fair. It was supposed to be punishing him, why should I be involved?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You agreed just now that you would accept the consequences if you lost the bet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smirked, looking as if he found the situation amusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona's face turned red all of a sudden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was actually more traditional at heart than me. Besides having had one previous romantic relationship, she had hardly ever interacted with the opposite sex and rarely went to places like nightclubs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly came to Fiona's rescue and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kissing is a bit too much, if it's not possible, I can have a drink for Fiona instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I originally wanted to avoid Fiona's embarrassment, but little did I know, Paige said:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, we all agreed just now, otherwise the game won't be fun. Since we are playing this game tonight, everyone has to let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige also didn't know what was going on, she actually didn't help Fiona, but instead made fun of her. I got so angry that I fiercely pinched her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige, weren't you framing Fiona?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, on the other hand, leaned in close to my ear and said with a mischievous smile:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, there are some things you don't understand, just listen to my arrangements."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="105.html">« Prev</a><a href="107.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
