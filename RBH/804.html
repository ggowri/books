It'd be strange if they weren't surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, I jerked my hand away from Elliott's. Despite having done nothing, I found my cheeks inexplicably flushing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Quinn came to my rescue just in time:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you and sis go ahead and eat. There are some things I can't discuss right now. I'll explain everything later."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn finished speaking, quickly shooting Carole a look, signaling her to take their mother upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carole got it right away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she immediately pulled her mother into the elevator, diffusing the awkward situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn exhaled a sigh of relief. He glanced down at me, shaking his head slightly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get going."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I gave a nod. Just as we were about to leave, Elliott called out to me from behind:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait up, Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice wasn't loud, but his tone was icy, carrying an unmistakable hint of command.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I turned to glance at him, immediately feeling the icy aura that surrounded him. I reckoned he was already fuming inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Quinn sticks around, they might just end up in a verbal spat and start throwing punches.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, I said to Quinn:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you go ahead with your stuff. Let Elliott take me back to the office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's face fell noticeably, but he knew Elliott was a patient now. So, he didn't say anything, just turned and truly walked away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and I were heading in the direction of the company.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was awkward and rigid:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did Quinn's mom just say to you? Something about you just having a baby? That's utter nonsense! When did you have a child? They're just being overly solicitous! That's how they all are!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could hear his strong dissatisfaction. However, he didn't seem to suspect anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a glance, his amnesia seemed all too real. Otherwise, he wouldn't have forgotten that I was once pregnant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie cares about me. Are you seriously jealous of that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I retorted nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott instantly laid his hand on my shoulder. He looked at me, his expression serious:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why does it feel like you've changed so much? I'm not jealous. It's just that you deliberately keep your distance from me in front of Quinn. Why are you doing this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was sharp enough to notice that I was keeping my distance from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rubbed my temples. His amnesia was proving to be quite a nuisance. Not only did I have to play along, but I also had to watch my words, careful not to be too harsh on him:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't. You're overthinking. I'm just not used to being too intimate in public."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me with a meaningful gaze, "Is that really the case? Are you sure it's not because you like him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, quit being so paranoid all the time. You weren't like this before. What's gotten into you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no choice but to tell him to shut up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the trick worked. He immediately stopped discussing the previous matters. His tone also softened:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all because I care too much about you. I feel like I've become a different person."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's all you need to know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shrugged off his hand effortlessly, then shoved my hands into my pockets, striding forward with an air of icy indifference.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott caught up with me once again. Despite my insistence on not being too intimate in public, he deliberately wrapped his arm around my waist, accompanying me to the base of the office building.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we keep walking into the office like this, all cozy and close, I honestly don't know what I'd tell my subordinates if they saw us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no choice but to halt in my tracks and say to him:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I've arrived. Elliott, you can head back to your stuff now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he didn't put up a fight. He glanced at his watch:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll head back to the office then. I'll swing by to pick you up after work."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His relentless pursuit was really starting to wear me down. I hastily waved my hands, trying to signal him to back off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see, I'm not sure how long I'll be tied up."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="803.html">« Prev</a><a href="805.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
