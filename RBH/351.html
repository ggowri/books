My words were a declaration, telling Elliott that I no longer would be the woman who blindly followed him and revolved around his every whim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would focus on myself and my tiny goals. Austin's illness and the precarious state of Glory Group demanded my independence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I no longer wanted to be immersed in romance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott once again grasped my waist and forced me to face him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean, you just treat me as your sexual partner? I can't interfere with you in any way?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could sense the annoyance in his tone. After all, I had never spoken in such a tone before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can understand it that way. We just take what we need."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew my words would sting him, but I was resolute to inform him of my change from a woman who blindly loved him to an independent woman, even if I still loved him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I needed him to understand that I was no longer the same woman who was obsessed with him. I didn't want to be controlled by anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We get what we need? What are you thinking? We are a legitimate couple!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was clearly unhappy with my words. His grip on my waist tightened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help shouting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't this what you wanted? Didn't you say before that you hated me relying on you? So, I am different."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott fell silent. I remembered his same yells at me in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Now that I became independent and less clingy, he should be pleased.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why was he depressed? He suddenly stopped talking. Was he sad?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was tired of the repeated sex with him. At this moment, I barely kept sober.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I nearly fell asleep, he suddenly whispered in my ear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A woman can't be too independent. She always needs to rely on a man."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a typical double standard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to hate me for being too clingy. He wished me to be independent and stay away from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he disagreed that I should be independent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that what men wanted changed with their moods.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "I was no longer the woman who revolved around you all day long."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fell directly into sleep and ignored his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the morning, Elliott planned to go to Bryant Group after breakfast. He spoke of a medical project that he was working on at the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This project would greatly affect Bryant Group's position in the medical field in the next two years. Therefore, he attached great importance to the project.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard that it was a medical project, my mind crazily worked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the knowledge from my past life, I knew that investing in the medical field was the key to saving Glory Group from its current crisis.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="350.html">« Prev</a><a href="352.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
