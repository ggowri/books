The moment I stepped through the door, I couldn't help but heave a huge sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, as if he had set an alarm, gave me a call:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Made it to the office yet? Elliott hasn't been giving you a hard time, has he?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I let out a soft chuckle:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No worries, I'm already at the office."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good," Quinn paused, then suddenly added, "You know who I just bumped into at the door?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's question immediately set off alarm bells in my head. A strong gut feeling compelled me to blurt out:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be Lisa?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was taken aback:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you guess so accurately? Yes, it's her. And, we even had a little chat."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I grew anxious, "What did she talk to you about?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She spoke in riddles. She suggested that if I wanted you, I could collaborate with her. As for how exactly we'd work together, she told me to arrange a meeting when I had the time. Then, she handed me her business card."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn dumped all these circumstances on me in one go. Hearing him say this, I instantly felt that this Lisa was far from simple.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you kidding me? Work with her? What on earth is this woman up to? I just can't figure her out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I retorted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I ignored her. But, I kept her business card, just in case."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, ignoring her is the best course of action. She's elusive, always giving me this feeling that she's haunting me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I furrowed my brows, finding something off about this woman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, be careful. Try to avoid any interaction with her as much as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instantly let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crux of the matter now is, even though I had no intention of crossing paths with this woman, she seems to pop up in my line of sight every now and then, showing an uncanny interest in my affairs. And I have no clue what she's up to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, I don't give a damn about her. After all, she's just a stranger who happens to look a lot like me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with Quinn, I headed back to my office and got down to business.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about an hour of being swamped with work, the receptionist suddenly came up to me, saying someone was looking for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe it, Carole and her mom showed up at my office, and they were carrying a bunch of gifts, no less.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heard your office was nearby, so mom insisted on dropping by to see you. We just tried this coconut milk jelly and it was delicious, so we brought you some. Also, we happened to pass by a baby store while shopping, so we picked up some clothes and toys for Noah. Just a few things for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon spotting me, Carole immediately made her way over, greeting me with a warm, "Hello."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? You guys are too kind. Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flurry, I took the items from their hands, ushering them into the living room. I then called for someone to bring them some coffee and snacks.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both she and her mom took a seat. Carole's mother looked at me with a tender gaze. But I could distinctly sense that she seemed to have something she wanted to say to me...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="804.html">« Prev</a><a href="806.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
