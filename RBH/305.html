But then I thought about how frustrated and anxious Elliott was today and hastily held my words back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was worried you were too busy." Subconsciously, I defended.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he suddenly grabbed my shoulders, looked at me solemnly, and said, "Madeline, we're married, not strangers. You don't always have to keep everything from me just because you're worried that I'm busy. I want you to think of me first when anything happens, do you understand?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me with extraordinarily sincere eyes. It made me realize that he wasn't just saying it. He really thought so.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that through this period of time, Elliott was now really cared about me and began to be interested in my things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"okay, I get it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded. But I wasn't expecting him to suddenly lean in and wrap me in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an image I had fantasized about countless times. We sat together, hugging each other. However, we remained silent, with deep affection for each other.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a long night, and the corridor became colder and colder. The nurse came to urge us to leave here, but I insisted on staying there, and Elliott didn't leave either.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was the burger that made me less hungry, or maybe it was his presence that eased my exhaustion. I leaned on his shoulder and fell asleep without realizing it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I slept very deeply this sleep. I woke up again and found myself nestled in Elliott's arms. But at some point, he took off his coat and covered it all over me while Elliott sat on the bench wearing only a shirt and hugged me all night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I scrambled out of Elliott's arms and struggled to sit up. He immediately woke up as I moved. There was a hint of a sniffle in his magnetic voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you awake?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You put your jacket on me. What if you freeze?" I said in a panic at the sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, holding you is quite warm, like holding a small heater," Elliott said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sunrise appeared, and it was now apparently almost dawn. Elliott's facial lines all looked so soft that his whole face seemed gentle. And it was the first time I had ever seen such warmth in his cold face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I always used to consistently find him difficult to get along with. Elliott was condescending, detached, like a deity on high.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his kindness to me makes me realize that, in fact, there is no such thing as a man who is arrogant and cold all the time in this world. Elliott used to be arrogant and cold only because the person he wanted to warm up was not me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you just going to hold me like that all night? Then get up and move around. Are your arms numb?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I got up out of his arms while pulling him to his feet in a hurry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled slightly but wasn't impressed, saying, "I'm okay. You're so light and not heavy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's almost dawn. You should go back early and have a res. Elliott, you don't have to be so ..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was touched in my heart. And I just wanted to say something, but before the words came out, Elliott covered my mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's what I should do."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of letting me say any more, he stood up and stretched his body. Elliott then opened his phone and looked at his schedule for the day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew he had a lot on his plate and a full schedule every day, so I urged him again to hurry back and get some more rest. Elliott didn't object, either. He gave me some advice and then left the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I escorted him all the way to his car. However, just as I turned around to leave, Elliott suddenly grabbed my hand. I turned around in shock. Suddenly, he leaned over and gave me a deep kiss on the forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kiss came unexpectedly, and I was unprepared. And when I realized it, Elliott had already gotten into the car and quickly drove away from the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked in the direction he was driving away and couldn't help but feel very reassured.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as I was staring blankly in the direction of Elliott's car as it went away, there were a couple of ear-splitting honks behind me...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="304.html">« Prev</a><a href="306.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
