Seeing me slowly waking up, Fiona couldn't help exclaiming while holding her chest,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my gosh! Madeline, you finally woke up. You had hypoglycemia just after pregnancy. What should you do? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help feeling nervous after hearing Fiona's words. So, I hurried to grab her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fiona, am I okay? Will it affect the child's development? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my really nervous expression, Fiona quickly leaned over to pat my face. Then, she comforted me softly,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing serious. You had a severe pregnancy reaction, so you suffered hypoglycemia. What's worse, you can't take medicine now. Anyway, you have to eat more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sighed in relief after hearing what Fiona said. Then, I quickly struggled to sit up. Looking up again, I saw Adam looking at me with concern, and he looked a little complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't move. You'd better lie down, resting more. What would you like to eat? I'll buy it for you right now. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>See me sitting up, Adam immediately came up to me and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, I had no intention of telling him the news of my pregnancy so early. However, as my personal assistant at work, it would be better for him to know about it earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking my head, I said to Adam,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no appetite right now. Adam, since you know my pregnancy, I won't hide it from you. Please help me share more work in the future. In addition, I hope you can keep my pregnancy a secret, not telling others about it for the time being. Can you do it? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded at once. Maybe he had already guessed something from the interaction between me and Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, don't worry. I know what I should do very well. And Fiona also told me about it just now. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have scheduled an ultrasound examination for you. Since you are awake, I will take you to the examination now. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Fiona said to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the blood test yesterday, I wanted to do a more detailed examination to see how the baby was going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona and Adam, one left and one right, helped me up from the bed. I pulled a wry face for their exaggerated behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to be so nervous. I suffered hypoglycemia just now. But I'm fine now, so I can walk alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. You need special treatment now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Fiona and Adam didn't listen to me but to carry me to the ultrasound department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona lined up for me. I sat down on a seat. Afraid that I would be hungry, Adam immediately ran out, offering to buy me some food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking around, I found that most of the people sitting around me were pregnant women with slightly bulging bellies and their husbands who accompanied them for the examination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I suddenly felt complicated in my mind. Then, I subconsciously placed my hands on my lower abdomen. I thought that I had been diagnosed as infertile, but now I miraculously had a child. I couldn't help feeling great happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I felt a little sad inside after thinking that I would have to live the rest of my life alone with my baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While thinking about it in my mind, I suddenly heard a familiar voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This hospital is really shabby, which is really far behind the Bryant Hospital. It's really annoying that there are so many people queuing up. If Doctor Louis hadn't worked here, I would have been unwilling to come here for a checkup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound was so sharp that many people who were waiting there looked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subconsciously looking up, I saw Giselle with her bulging belly. At the same time, she was supported by a girl wearing a cap and sunglasses, standing impatiently at the door of the waiting room.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="444.html">« Prev</a><a href="446.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
