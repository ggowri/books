Moreover, there were also some mixed-race and foreign hunks among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These women truly had exquisite taste!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder they chose to come aboard this cruise. This party also included such stunning elements, really broadening my horizons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those socialites who were just surrounding me moments ago, now, under the influence of alcohol and hormones, were becoming particularly uninhibited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They each chose a desirable male companion and started dancing on the deck to the music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey leaned close to my ear, smiling, and said, "Madeline, see if there's anyone you fancy here. These men are all yours to choose from. Tonight, their mission is to make us happy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked by this unexpected scene, unable to find the words. "Uh, this... might not be quite appropriate, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey smiled mysteriously, "What's the harm? Just because men can indulge in pursuing pleasure doesn't mean we women can't, right? Don't worry, no matter what happens tonight, I won't tell Quinn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected Grey, who seemed so amiable, to be so liberal in private.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie Grey, you go dance, I'll just stay here and look around. I'm not really interested in hunks," I shrugged, quickly adding with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, when you're out for a good time, it's all about kicking back a notch, right? Just having some handsome fellas to shoot the breeze with, bust a move on the dance floor, and share a laugh or two. It's not like we're breaking any rules here," Grey continued, patting my shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a foreign hunk in the crowd winked at her, exuding a charming allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately understood and swiftly threw herself into the embrace of the foreign hunk like a butterfly to a flower. Soon, they were dancing together in the swirling music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found a chair and sat down, smiling as I admired this beautiful scene before me. I watched their dancing figures and the handsome guys looking for dance partners. I couldn't help but marvel at how shallow and straightforward the joy of the wealthy ladies was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, life was indeed fleeting, and everyone had their own pursuits and preferences. As long as they didn't break the law, seemingly, there was nothing wrong with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men got to sow their oats, and there was no rule saying women must strictly adhere to conventions and live by the book. Letting loose every now and then was not such a sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, compared to my previous choice of sticking to one man like glue, these women in front of me clearly lived much more freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sipped my grape juice. Despite the chill of the breeze on the deck, the organizers had already taken measures to keep warm. Plus, with the enthusiasm of these men and women, I didn't feel cold at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the corner, several young couples couldn't contain their passion and were engulfed in fervent kisses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One couple was not far from me, unabashedly kissing each other, and the sound of it clearly reached my ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were shameless, and I couldn't help but blush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced in their direction subconsciously and noticed the man's hand had already slipped into the woman's clothes. The woman's face was flushed, her eyes glazed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gee, this scene was indeed a bit steamy and not quite suitable for pregnant women to watch.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="573.html">« Prev</a><a href="575.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
