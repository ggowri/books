He directly pulled me up from my seat and dragged me decisively through the crowd quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what are you doing?" He was walking in front and tightly held my hand. I had no choice but to follow him and couldn't help shouting at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care if my steps were steady. Fortunately, I wore flat shoes. Otherwise, I might fall if I follow him moving at such a fast speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just dragged me to the corridor outside the venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the disease, the hotel was in a semi-closed state, and the corridors were empty. Most people were inside the venue, and no one passed by at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott pinned me against the wall, looked at me angrily, and bellowed, "Madeline, do you have to seduce other men in front of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was strong dissatisfaction in his tone. Judging from his words, it was probably because my passionate chat with Dalton infuriated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, did he not understand the situation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We had divorced. Whoever I met or what I did had nothing to do with him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered coldly, "Aren't you too nosy, ex-husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately called him ex-husband just to make him realize that we had no relationship at all now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ex-husband?" Unexpectedly, Elliott became even more furious. He got closer to me, lifted my chin with his hand, and said coldly, "Madeline, we are not divorced. I am not your ex-husband yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not divorce?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, was the divorce certificate and agreement he sent a joke?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt more and more ridiculous, so I simply slapped his hand away, sneering, "Elliott, are you having fever, or are you still sleepwalking? Have you forgotten the divorce certificate and agreement you sent me before? Have you lost your memory? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just finished my words, and I saw his eyes suddenly change as if he had heard something unbelievable. He looked at me and asked in disbelief, "What divorce certificate? What agreement? Madeline, what are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he playing dumb with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sent the divorce certificate and agreement in person, and his signature was on the agreement. Why did he act as if he didn't know about it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, stop pretending. We have now legally dissolved our marriage. From now on, we have no relationship. No matter what I do, it is my freedom. Please do not exercise your husband's right over me again," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The empty corridor was a bit cold, and I couldn't help but shudder. I didn't bother talking to him there anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott acted like he never did it, his eyes full of disbelief. He let go of my hand in despair and murmured, "This is impossible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The divorce agreement has your signature, and the stamp on the divorce certificate is absolutely authentic. Elliott, stop pretending. You will only make me feel sick!" I uttered coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to stand there with him and act. After coldly exposing his tricks, I turned around and walked into the venue again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the venue burst into thunderous applause, and the award ceremony had officially begun.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="497.html">« Prev</a><a href="499.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
