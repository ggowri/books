Don't falsely accuse me of anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively waved my hand and continued to speak casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found that, compared to my own sadness and anger, I would rather see Elliott angry and concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pleasure of revenge made me particularly happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, in the future, stay away from Quinn. Don't forget, you and I are still husband and wife!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott angrily pinched my chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about you? Can you stay away from those wild women?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I coldly retorted. At the same time, I closely watched Elliott. I wanted to see his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were simply being unreasonable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coldly uttered a few words. In his tone, there was contempt towards me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was I being unreasonable?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In our conversation in the previous life, this sentence also appeared frequently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps in his eyes, no matter how much I changed, no matter what I became, I was just a woman who was being unreasonable and not worth his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh coldly. Then, I pushed away his hand that was holding my chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, I don't want to be an unreasonable woman either. Elliott, how about from today onwards, we go our separate ways? You can have any woman you want, I promise not to interfere. But what I do and who I am with, please don't meddle, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me coldly. He seemed to be watching a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, how could you, as a married woman, say such things? You want to have an open marriage with me? I'm sorry, but I'm not that open-minded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott could really say these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can a married man do what he does openly and honestly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since we got married until now, has he ever regarded me as his wife?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been high and mighty, doing whatever he pleased. He spent time with whomever he chose. Rumors about him spread with whomever he was seen. And I, am I supposed to remain faithful and keep to an empty house just for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you can't do an open marriage, we might as well get a divorce. Elliott, I'm serious about filing for divorce. I hope you'll consider it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you were definitely trying to provoke my limits, weren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott instantly became furious. His voice was deep, like a devil from the depths of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I am no longer afraid of him getting angry like before. I smiled indifferently. Because I didn't want to show any concern for him in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can wholeheartedly focus on me, I can also do the same for you. If you can't, then I can't either. Elliott, loyalty in marriage requires both parties to be able to do so, doesn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him and said word by word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what I didn't expect was that he suddenly laughed sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, are you now talking to me about marriage equality? Are you even worthy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words, indeed, made people feel sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carried himself with the same high posture as before. It was as if I was born to submit to him, to obey him. No matter how he treated me, I had to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>my</span><span> previous life, I was too humble in front of him. I waited for him for too long in the same place. But in this life, I will not allow myself to be like that again. I want him to watch me, step by step, leaving his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him. I thought, at that moment, the smile on my face must have been more dazzlingly eerie than a poppy flower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, why am I not deserving? In terms of family background, education, appearance, and everything we possess, I am not much inferior to you. Why can't I demand equality? Why? Just because I have loved you for so many years, does that mean I deserve to be stepped on, trampled, and humiliated by you? Elliott, why don't you go die?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="65.html">« Prev</a><a href="67.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
