In this way, even if she gives birth to an abnormal child, Elliott won't break up with her easily," after chatting and laughing with them for a while, I analyzed rationally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's easy. Just let Sylvia cause trouble a few more times," Fiona said with a smile, and what she said was also what I was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that I was pregnant and still had to deal with a lot of things in the Glory Group. Since I had been parted with Elliott, I didn't want to be involved with his things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to my understanding of Sylvia, I believed she would not waste the chance of getting close to Elliott when she knew I had broken up with Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would love to see Sylvia and Giselle fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the three of us discussed it for a while, more people came to Fiona for medical treatment. Fiona ordered Paige to have a B-ultrasound, so I accompanied Paige to the B-ultrasonic room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital was not big, and everyone was concentrated in the obstetrics and gynecology department, so we met Laura in the corridor of the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always dressed elegantly, but this time she wore pajamas without any makeup. She looked several times older than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could tell that she had rushed here immediately when she heard something happened to Elliott's child last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me and Paige walking hand in hand, she stopped for a moment and immediately focused on my slightly bulging belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I was pregnant, I had tried to dress loosely, so people couldn't tell that I was pregnant at first glance, but now my belly was getting bigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She obviously couldn't believe what she saw, so she stared at my belly. Her look changed rapidly, and I didn't know what she was thinking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige saw that Laura was very curious about my belly, so she deliberately smiled and greeted Laura, "Hey, Mrs. Laura Bryant. Why are you in the hospital so early in the morning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige asked deliberately, smiled, and pulled me forward. At the same time, she deliberately patted my butt and motioned for me to show my belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I came to the hospital to stay with Elliott. He drank too much last night and was sent to the hospital. Madeline, have you gained weight recently? Why does your belly look much bigger than before?" Laura said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was hiding her embarrassment with a smile. She probably thought we didn't know Giselle was trying to keep her child, so she didn't mention that but asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline is not gaining weight but is pregnant. It has been more than three months. I don't know which quack doctor diagnosed Madeline as infertile before, causing her and Elliott to divorce. In fact, Madeline is in good health, and the doctor said that her baby is likely to be a boy," Paige said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige took the chance to humiliate Laura and told her the news about my pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I saw Laura was startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she stared at my belly as if looking at an alien. She looked as if she was obsessed with having a grandson. Even her voice suddenly became exaggerated. "Madeline is pregnant? Really? It's been three months? Oh my god, why Elliott never mentioned it?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="552.html">« Prev</a><a href="554.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
