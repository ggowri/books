You went to that dangerous place in Ruini for me, and as soon as I found out, I rushed over immediately. Fortunately, we arrived there in time, otherwise, this child, as well as you and Jane, could have lost their lives. Mexico is a haven for criminals, and we cannot imagine the darkness there. Luckily, you and the baby are both very fortunate, as he was rescued in time. Do you want to see his photo?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn held my hand and looked at me affectionately, his eyes filled with tenderness and happiness, as if the child was his own baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, the man who appeared riding a motorcycle was Quinn, not Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that I was mistaken, I mistakenly thought it was Elliott who came to save me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Child... I was safe, until this moment, I finally snapped out of my daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, I wanted to see the child. After all, he was the life that remained with me after experiencing the threat of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see him quickly, how is he now? Is he behaving well in the incubator?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn quickly took out his phone and opened the photo album. I saw a tiny baby wearing a light blue onesie, lying on his side in an incubator. His two pink little hands looked especially beautiful, with a hint of redness. His chin was pointed, and his </span><span>curious eyes looked up and down. Although he was a premature baby and a bit thin, judging from his facial features, he would definitely grow up to be a cool boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My intuition was right. From the moment I got pregnant, I had a faint feeling that it was a boy. I didn't expect my intuition to be so accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but watch that video over and over again, watching him move around. I was deeply moved. I wanted to kiss him through the screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was really cute, with fair skin just like yours, and his eyes were also very lively. When he grows up, he will definitely be a handsome guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled happily and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, but, his face..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly stopped and didn't continue speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because some topics were very sad, but they were the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby looked a lot like him... I have to admit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was still young, it was evident that he resembled Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to start over for the sake of the baby and him, I can contact him right now and have him come over so you can talk things out. If you don't want him to know about the child, then let's do as we discussed before and be together, and I will be there to raise him, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn looked into my eyes, with emotions so sincere and longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately fell into silence again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing me silent, Quinn instinctively furrowed his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you go to such a dangerous place like Ruini, disregarding everything, for me? Isn't it because you care about me? Madeline, we have been together for so long, facing our own hearts, haven't we? I want to know, do you really just see me as a friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I slowly lifted my head and looked at Quinn in front of me, who looked so haggard. In fact, after going through so much, I understood very well that he was a very reliable man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I also knew that if I were with him, he would definitely love me very much. And being with Elliott, everything was filled with unknowns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn really loved me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This </span><span>wa</span><span>s also the reason why I immediately rushed to save him when I heard that he was in danger.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="749.html">« Prev</a><a href="751.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
