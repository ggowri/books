I'll get someone to send you back!" Quinn frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, thanks!" Elliott pushed him away again, glaring at Quinn. "I thought you were a friend, yet how did you treat me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I take you as a good friend too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's tone was calm and resigned. After all, up until now, nothing had happened between him and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Quinn didn't feel guilty towards Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott clearly didn't think so, he chuckled, "Good friends? But you like my wife, huh? Quinn, you're such a hypocrite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's words were filled with immense humiliation and mockery, but Quinn calmly met his gaze and said, "I only feel sorry for Madeline's plight, nothing more. If you treat her well, how could things end up like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, pointed at Quinn's nose and asked defiantly, "You had no right to lecture me. If it weren't for you, Madeline and I would never have ended up like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn caught his wrist and pushed it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you are not in a good mood tonight. You should go back and calm down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm down?" Elliott sneered again, "If you were me, would you calm down? Quinn, you stole my woman and expect me to be calm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean he stole your woman? You didn't cherish me, Elliott!" Upon hearing these words, I stood up and retorted at Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't cherish you?" Elliott's attitude instantly became sharp. "How am I supposed to cherish you? Madeline, have you ever given me a chance to cherish you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't understand how he could be so shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott and the Bryant family betrayed me. They kicked me out of the house. Now, he said I never gave him a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I? Elliott, you actually said such words! Aren't you afraid of being punished?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was furious, at that moment I really wished to pick up the glass on the table and smash it towards Elliott, just like Paige did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me and then stumbled towards me step by step. As he approached, the strong smell of alcohol hit me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, then glanced at my belly, feeling a bit disappointed. Immediately after, he put on a skeptical expression. Then, he suddenly smiled and grabbed my neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are just taking advantage of my love!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sounded indifferent when he said this sentence. And for the moment, he became the aloof Elliott he usually was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott's sudden act of choking me startled everyone. Fiona rushed over, sternly saying, "Elliott, let her go. You are drunk, don't go crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am sober!" Elliott responded, then released his hand that was gripping my neck. Suddenly, he said again, "Madeline, I have misjudged you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Misjudged me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't understand why Elliott suddenly said such words. He had barely looked at me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him and felt an inexplicable coldness in my heart. And the baby in my belly suddenly moved strongly, as if sensing the conflict between its parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just at that moment, the door of the room was suddenly slammed open. A sudden sound startled us!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="652.html">« Prev</a><a href="654.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
