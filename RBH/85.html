As soon as it was daylight, I went to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect Adam to arrive earlier than me. It turns out he has a habit of exercising early in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Adam saw me, he immediately walked over. He was very attentive and noticed my dark circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, did you not sleep well last night?" Adam asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I yawned and took out a mirror and skincare products from my bag, and started putting on makeup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You definitely didn't have breakfast. So, I prepared a breakfast for you. This is a sandwich I made. Try it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although young, Adam was considerate. He immediately brought the breakfast he had prepared and placed it in front of me. Moreover, he even poured a glass of milk into a pink cup specially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, you are so considerate. Why are you still single?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I saw that pink cup, I laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, I wasn't always this nice to everyone. You've been working hard. And, I could sense that you seemed a bit unhappy," Adam blinked his eyes mischievously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect his insight to be so strong. I never showed any emotions at work, but he knew I was unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't have any other thoughts about me, okay. I was already married," I couldn't help but joke with a smile, infected by his smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam laughed out loud and quickly waved his hand, saying, "Madeline, don't joke. Even if you were not married, I wouldn't dare to pursue you. I can only admire you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam was very honest. I thought he was pretty good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on his evaluation of me, I finally knew how wonderful I was in the eyes of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was the daughter of the president of the Glory Group. My parents loved me very much and fulfilled all my demands. Since my birth, my life has been better than many others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was I deceived by Elliott in my previous life, to become so humble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I opened the water cup that Adam gave me, and the smell of milk hit my nose. I took a sip, and the temperature was just right, and the taste was also very good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sandwich he made was delicious. I finished it in one bite and quickly started working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the morning, Adam arranged for Audrey to audition. I met Audrey, who was about to become a star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey had good skin and was about 5.5 feet tall. She was wearing a simple white shirt, jeans, and light makeup. Despite being an unknown actress at the time, she performed excellently and showed great potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the director and I watched her performance, we both gave her high praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, I was busy casting for the company. We auditioned several actors one after another and then proceeded to discuss. Gradually, the key roles for this play were basically confirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten days passed quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to leave Serenity Villa very early every day and return very late. Elliott seemed busy as well. Although we lived in the same villa, we hardly ever saw each other.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="84.html">« Prev</a><a href="86.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
