On the contrary, instead of feeling sad, I felt an inexplicable sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My actions frightened my parents, Quinn and Marcus. They thought I couldn't bear the blow and stared at me blankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. Everything is over. From today on, I am single again!" I took a deep breath and smiled. It was as if a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw me like this, Quinn thought that I had experienced some kind of trauma and quickly comforted me, "Madeline, if you feel sad, just cry. It's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Madeline. Do you want me to go to your room with you and have a private chat?" Lily also asked hurriedly, fearing that I would not be able to bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you should look at things positively. It doesn't matter. You still have a long road ahead. It's better to end a wrong relationship in time than to dwell on it," Marcus said with a solemn expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at each of them, shook my head, and said, "Don't worry, I'm really fine. I'm not sad, but relieved. He doesn't bother me, and we don't owe each other anything. This is the best ending."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like father, like daughter. Austin understood what I really meant. He came forward, put his arm around my shoulders, and said in a deep voice, "Madeline is right. Since they're not suitable, it is a better choice to get separate early. We are not worthy of the Bryant family. From now on, we'll go on a separate way! But there is one thing. Today, they treat you like this. If they dare to pester you in the future, I will never forgive them easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin spoke decisively, but I understood that his heart hurt more than anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a parent, no one wanted their children to get divorced. They would always feel heartbroken to see their daughter being despised and ignored by her husband's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced at Austin subconsciously. I noticed that his eyes were slightly red, but he didn't want me to see his pain. He pretended that nothing happened and quickly turned his head away. Then, he walked to the balcony alone and smoked quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The initially joyful atmosphere at home immediately disappeared without a trace after receiving Elliott's express delivery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell into silence, and even the breakfast in front of them suddenly lost its former attractive aroma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Quinn suggested, "It's Christmas, and everyone was on vacation. Why don't we go for a road trip in the countryside? I heard Paige opened a motel, and said it was pretty good. How about we go take a look?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could say anything, Lily immediately agreed, "Sure, you bring Madeline out for a walk, so she doesn't get bored at home alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go too, since I have nothing to do alone," Marcus chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll give Paige a call." After saying that, Quinn went beside and called Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never been to Paige's motel before. When her motel opened, I was busy filming Do Not Love in Louis City. I wasn't able to visit due to scheduling conflicts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Paige often posted photos and videos of her motel on Instagram. It looked like the environment was well-maintained and very elegant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the call, Quinn immediately told us, "Paige and Philip are free. Let's go. We can go straight to their place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I went upstairs and changed into a down jacket, a thick black knitted hat, and even white fleece pants. Later, the three of us followed the location Paige sent and drove to her motel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took about an hour to drive there from my home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When we arrived, Paige and Philip were already standing at the entrance, waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It snowed heavily last night. Although it was a sunny Christmas, the melting snow still made the weather extremely cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige and her big belly wrapped tightly in her down jacket. From a distance, she looked as cute as Winnie the Pooh, while Philip, who stood beside her, appeared taller and sturdy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everyone!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="491.html">« Prev</a><a href="493.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
