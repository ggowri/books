This undoubtedly meant that she had already accepted Giselle as her future daughter-in-law.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this made me feel even colder inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was thinking I could stop treating Laura as family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on, let's handle this," Elliott coldly ordered. Then he stood up straight, and reached out his hand towards me, indicating for me to hold his arm as we went out to see what was happening.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Elliott and I appeared side by side in the living room, Giselle and her mother were still leisurely wandering around Serenity Villa as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, this balcony is great. I'll put a lounge chair here later, so I can sunbathe here when my belly gets big."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, this room has good lighting. It could be turned into the baby's nursery in the future, so the little one can crawl around."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mom, I think this house is really nice, much better than our apartment. I really want to move in soon. What do you think about Elliott and that wretched woman..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle already seemed to consider herself the future mistress of Serenity Villa, happily chatting with her mother about their future plans in the living room. However, when she suddenly saw Elliott and me standing in the corner of the living room, she visibly panicked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile froze on her face, and the words she was about to say got stuck in her throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole, at this point, hadn't realized that we were at home. She picked up from where Giselle left off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're already pregnant. Their divorce is just a matter of time. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Mrs. Santos, is this how you teach your daughter to get pregnant before marriage, to break up someone else's family? Your values and morals are truly unbelievable."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, I couldn't contain my anger any longer and blurted out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My voice was loud and clear, echoing and shaking Nicole to the core.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned around in shock, and the vase she was holding fell with a loud crash.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you... How are you both at home?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole widened her eyes in disbelief, looking at Elliott and me. She probably never expected that both of us would be home at the same time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I... um, Mrs. Laura Bryant said Serenity Villa has been empty for too long, so she asked me and my mom to come take a look."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was now flustered to the point of being at a loss for words as she hurriedly tried to explain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes turned icy cold, his lips pursed lightly as he asked in a cold voice, "Is that so? Just taking a look?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More than just a look, she already planned how to renovate the rooms and furniture. Giselle, are you so eager to replace me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I coldly continued where Elliott left off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle lowered her head. She had been visibly flustered before, but after I asked this question, she suddenly raised her head, looking at me with a determined gaze and said, "Regardless, I'm already pregnant with Elliott's child. Elliott should give me an explanation, shouldn't he?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence wasn't just directed at me; it was also directed at Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's eyes turned particularly cold as he said, "You came at the right time today. The three of us will sit down and have a serious discussion about this child."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Elliott finished speaking, he took my hand and walked to the main seat on the sofa, sitting down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Giselle and her mother exchanged a glance and then chose to sit across from us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You keep saying this child is mine, but you have no evidence. What proof do you have?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at Giselle, disgust evident in his eyes. Clearly, he was extremely repulsed by Giselle's actions.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="377.html">« Prev</a><a href="379.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
