Whether you are born a boy or a girl, they will treat you as their own grandchild and raise you. My parents are very kind-hearted, so rest assured, they have decided to accept you and will never look down on you even a bit. So, can you dispel the worries in your heart?" Quinn walked up to me and said all of this in one breath, his gaze looking at me with a sense of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his gaze, I could clearly feel that he sincerely wanted to continue with me, regardless of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I could never understand one thing from beginning to end. Why am I worth Quinn going to such lengths?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never owed me anything, and I didn't think I was beautiful enough to make a man do anything for me. So why was he willing to go to such lengths for me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was very confused, even though he was sincere, but I looked into his eyes and they were filled with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, to be honest, I sincerely thank you and your parents for accepting me so selflessly and accepting everything about me. However, marriage is a lifelong commitment, and the matter of having children is even more important. It's not as simple as we thought. Besides, I really don't deserve you to do this for me. You can definitely choose a better girl and don't have to be tied to me. You deserve a better happiness." I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn once again supported my shoulders, and in their deep brown eyes, there was an abundance of sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you feel that having a child would complicate things if we were together, but now I have resolved all your concerns. Not only do my parents support us, but Carole also supports us being together. Carole said she watched your speech and thought you spoke really well. She believes you are a good girl and if you marry me and become </span><span>part of our family, we will all be your relatives. We won't let you suffer any losses, trust me, okay?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Quinn, it was just talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this time, to my surprise, as he was talking, he suddenly knelt down on one knee and took out an exquisite jewelry box from his pocket, opening it in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the jewelry box, that large diamond ring almost dazzled my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined that Quinn not only came for real, but also, he knelt in front of me with such a big carat diamond ring, proposing to me so sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt as if I had been petrified in an instant, with every drop of blood in my body freezing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood frozen in place, looking at the diamond ring, then at Quinn, my face filled with indescribable astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing, Quinn?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn straightened his posture, holding the diamond ring in his hands, the gleam in his eyes shining brighter than the ring itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, this is the greatest sincerity I and my family have ever shown. This diamond ring is the token of love that Alexander gave to Jessica when he proposed. Jessica gave me this diamond ring, saying that girls don't like men who only talk without taking action. If I have truly made up my mind, I must take practical action to give you the greatest sense of security. I understand your concerns and I know that you have been hurt by marriage and love, but rest assured, I will never be another Elliott. I will not let you down, I am truly mentally prepared to give you the greatest happiness," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Quinn spoke these words, tears welled up in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his words made my originally calm heart suddenly beat faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never imagined that I would be proposed to so solemnly in my entire life and that someone would be so desperate to be with me, disregarding all my flaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I considered myself to be very ordinary, even as ordinary as can be. Quinn felt this way about me, and I could only feel that this affection was too heavy, too precious, just like the extraordinary diamond ring on his finger. How could I dare to easily accept it?</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="706.html">« Prev</a><a href="708.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
