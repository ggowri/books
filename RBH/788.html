I need more information to assist you better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When did she meet Quinn? She's actually attending Quinn's party?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slight jolt of surprise coursed through me. But by then, she had already set down the gift and was making her way towards Zara. They chatted and laughed, wrapping each other in a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lisa, it's my brother's birthday today. I'm so thrilled you could make it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You told me, and there's no way I wouldn't come. Besides, in Hoswich City, you're my best friend."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clad in a black satin V-neck dress, Lisa's waist appeared incredibly slender. Her long neck and fair skin radiated an air of elegance. However, her face, bearing a striking resemblance to mine, stirred a sense of awkwardness within me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is she that close with Zara?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A question mark formed in my mind once again. Meanwhile, she had already set down the gift box in her hands, engaging in animated conversation with Zara and a few other girls.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These girls seemed to have all been invited by Zara, clearly her friends.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were engrossed in a lively conversation. In contrast, I sat alone in the corner, a picture of solitude. But, I was past the age of such socializing and had no interest in it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About a dozen minutes later.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn returned, surprisingly carrying a beautifully wrapped bouquet of sunflowers, tastefully accented with white carnations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sunflowers are my absolute favorite. When he walked in holding one, I was taken aback for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, he was handing me the flowers right in front of these girls. His eyes, usually sharp and piercing, softened the moment they met mine:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've put so much effort into baking me a cake, so let me give you a bouquet of flowers in return. May you always shine brightly like a sunflower. Also, congratulations on the birth of your child. I've carefully selected these flowers just for you. Do you like them?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn truly cares about me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though today was his birthday, he was still in such a hurry to pick flowers for me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he declaring his care for me to everyone?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took the flowers into my hands. The sight of those blooming sunflowers instantly lifted my spirits.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, you're such a sweetheart."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bro, you're playing favorites, aren't you? I came bearing gifts, even brought my friends along to celebrate your birthday. And all you do is give her flowers, but nothing for me, huh."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zara rose to her feet. The evident favoritism I showed towards Quinn clearly had her pride wounded. She crossed her arms, pouting, and began to protest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn gave her a casual glance:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a kid, what do you need flowers for? Besides, my flowers are reserved for someone special. If you want, I can give you a different gift."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had Quinn finished speaking than I distinctly caught Lisa giving me a serious glance. A peculiar smirk was playing on her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zara, is she your brother's girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa spoke, her voice raspy. Her throat seemed kissed by fire, carrying a unique texture that matched her outfit perfectly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, this is the one I was telling you about, the person who's a lot like you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zara rolled her eyes in annoyance. She was supposedly introducing me, but she couldn't even be bothered to glance my way. It was clear she was far from pleased with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lisa's gaze finally found mine, colliding head-on. We'd crossed paths a few times before, yet she looked at me as if she'd never seen me. She rose gracefully and walked towards me, extending her hand in my direction:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there, I'm Lisa, hailing from Norch City. Ever since I moved to Hoswich City, I've heard countless folks say we're like two peas in a pod. Now that we've finally met, I can't help but feel like we're long-lost sisters."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="787.html">« Prev</a><a href="789.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
