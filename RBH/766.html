She was in such a hurry that she quickly vanished from my sight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, my curiosity about this woman intensified.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying on a woman's sixth sense, I can confidently say that her willingness to stay by Elliott's side and care for him indicates a strong affection for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who, exactly, is she?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In my memory, there had never been a woman like this in Elliott's life before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just couldn't figure it out. So, when I got home and saw Marcus giving my dad some special treatment, I instinctively asked Marcus:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, have you ever heard of a woman named Lisa in the business circles of Norch City?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lisa? Why the sudden interest in her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked me with a hint of surprise, implying that he was clearly well-acquainted with Lisa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know her? Marcus, tell me, what's she like?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My interest was piqued instantly, and I turned to Marcus, questioning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's Mr. Fox, the head of the Norch City Pharmaceutical Association, a member of the local minority. Rumor has it that besides her knowledge in medicine, she also practices some unique healing methods of her ethnic group. Moreover, she has her own way of doing business and is quite the social butterfly. She's well-liked by many men and has close ties with numerous big pharma bosses back home. I've had a few conversations with her myself. Madeline, what's sparked your sudden interest in her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus relayed all the information he knew to me, his expression calm as he did so.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it doesn't make sense... If Marcus had seen Lisa, he should've noticed how much she looks like me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he hasn't even mentioned it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, having seen her, didn't you notice how much she resembles me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked, somewhat taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My words, however, seemed to perplex Marcus, causing him to furrow his brows in surprise:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lisa? She looks like you? I don't think so. In my memory, she's pretty average, always wearing a hat. I've never paid much attention to her looks. But how could she possibly resemble you? I've never thought so--"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's words sent me into a moment of deep contemplation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've crossed paths with Lisa at least three times, and she does have a penchant for hats, almost always sporting one. But I can say with absolute certainty, her features bear at least a 70% resemblance to mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus didn't quite see the resemblance between her and me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm pretty sure she must've had some work done.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why would she go under the knife to look like me? And now, she's always by Elliott's side. What on earth is she up to?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't fathom why she'd do such a thing. So, I turned to Marcus and said:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, could you do me a favor and keep an eye on Lisa? I'd appreciate if you could dig a little into her background as well. Also, about our plan to establish a medicinal herb base in Norch City, I've asked Jane to assist you. I've just had a baby, so I won't be able to make the trip. Does that sound good?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this unexpected incident, I've come to trust Jane completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though I haven't formally brought it up at the shareholders' meeting, in my mind, I've already appointed Jane as the head of the pharmaceutical division at Glory Group.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="765.html">« Prev</a><a href="767.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
