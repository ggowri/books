I couldn't bear it anymore, and though I knew it was very dangerous, I instinctively wanted to open the car door and rush out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as I was about to place my hand on the doorknob, suddenly, my phone </span><span>rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately picked up the phone, but to my surprise, it was Quinn calling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't Quinn injured?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this moment, those people caught him who was barely breathing not far away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, who called me on his phone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was trembling all over, and immediately picked up the phone. As soon as I picked up the phone, I hurriedly asked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? Why are you holding Quinn's phone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Quinn, can't you recognize my voice, Madeline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what I never expected was that Quinn's voice came through the phone incredibly clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his tone was very relaxed and natural, as if he had not been kidnapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was extremely shocked, but at that moment, the events happening outside the car didn't allow me to think any further. I immediately shouted into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, is it really you? You weren't kidnapped?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kidnapping? Of course not, I am fine. Where are you now? I will come to find you--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn said suspiciously into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was jealous and shocked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't reach him these days, and I thought he had been kidnapped. I didn't expect that all of this was actually a scam!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was not kidnapped, which means that the barely alive man was not Quinn. Delin intentionally disguised that man to look like Quinn in order to deceive us and make us bring money to the border!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder they didn't release him. It turns out that person of theirs was not Quinn at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation outside the car was already very dangerous. Upon hearing Jane's cry for help, I didn't have time to explain to Quinn, so I immediately hung up the phone and called Dehan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Rethe, I just received a call from Quinn! He was not kidnapped, they are deceiving us! Jane is in danger now, please send someone to rescue us quickly! Hurry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shouted for help into the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at that moment, I suddenly saw Jane's head being pressed against the car window by the tattooed man. Her hair had already been pulled apart, and the knife in her hand had been taken away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tattooed man crawled on her like a vicious wolf, crazily gnawing at her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching her blouse almost being torn apart, in that moment, I was so desperate that I was about to cry out loud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly looked around. When I saw the thermos cup in the car, I immediately picked it up and opened the car window, and fiercely smashed the tattooed man's head with the thermos cup!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="740.html">« Prev</a><a href="742.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
