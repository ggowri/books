After he kissed me wildly for a while, the lower part of his body reacted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I thought he would do something to be, he suddenly stopped and looked at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can do whatever I want? This is what you said."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him stand up directly, I didn't know what he wanted to do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he suddenly picked me up by the waist, pulled open the curtains, and then dragged me directly to the terrace outside the bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the blood in my body froze at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of us were naked standing on the balcony.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, what..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never been so bold. I was so anxious that I turned around and shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he covered my mouth, held my hands from behind to prevent me from turning around, and then pressed me against the glass of the sunroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could overlook the vast Louis River through the glass by lowering my head. Late at night, the river was silent and the landscape was in the dark.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're on the top floor, so there's no one upstairs. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott directly dispelled her worries with his words and became crazy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Late at night, everyone in Louis City seemed to be asleep. Presumably, no one would see what they were doing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I couldn't accept being exposed to the open air like this and doing such shameful things.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to break free, but Elliott didn't give me any chance to do it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced me against the glass of the sunroom. At this moment, the contrast between the sensory stimulation and the shame in my heart made me feel like a shameless slut. I was so shy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott got close to my body, his hands wrapped around my waist, and his fingertips kept rubbing my exposed skin. His voice sounded charming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you said, I can do whatever I want."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so bad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never thought that I would do such a crazy thing with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this kind of behavior was exciting. It also made me, who never had sex, experience the joy of sex.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Elliott wanted to vent all his desires. He used all his strength to torment me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We did it five times a night. My whole body was sore and swollen, and all the bones in my body seemed to have fallen apart. I had no strength and could only lazily lie on the bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We didn't sleep hugging each other until it was dawn soon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I woke up the next day, I was still held tightly in his arms, with my head resting on his arm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never slept so soundly, and my body had never been so sore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I sat up from the bed, my body still felt bad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as I sat up, Elliott woke up.
