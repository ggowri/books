Just seeing his bald head makes me wanna hurl. And he's such a jerk. Last time I hooked up with him, I ended up with bruises all over my arms and thighs for days."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're thinking about your career, cozying up to Mr. Hall might not be the worst idea. I mean, he's a big shot at Netflix. Keep him happy, and he might throw more opportunities your way. Isn't that how all those A-list celebs got their start? And trust me, Audrey's got nothing on you. Once I'm Mrs. Bryant, I'll make sure you get all the perks and help you shine."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll suck it up and set up another date with Mr. Hall. It's all part of the hustle. I can't bail out now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! If a girl's got the guts to step up, she can make it big! Jez, I believe in you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And imagine when I'm a famous celeb and you're Mrs. Bryant, we'll have it all. No one will ever mess with us again!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Jez, remember how tough things were back then? Dealing with a perv is nothing compared to that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them were dreaming up a brighter future without a second thought, but little did they know, I heard every word they said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but scoff at their endless chatter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like people said, birds of a feather flock together. And everyone'd got their ride-or-die.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I used to think Jezebel was all pure and aloof, just like her on-screen persona. Turned out, she was a schemer, willing to do whatever it took to climb the ladder of success.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that "lecherous old man" they were gabbing about was Rickson Hall. He was not just some Netflix senior, he'd been in the biz forever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dude'd got serious connections and resources. Enough to make someone like Jezebel cozy up to him however she could.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an awkward pause in the hallway, Giselle hopped back into bed, playing the damsel in distress, while Jezebel threw on her cap and mask and bounced.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Jezebel was gone, I made my exit too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this drama was about to hit the screens and the leading lady got caught up in some big scandal, the show would be toast.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I started cooking up a plan to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Elliott might be buying into Giselle's pick, but I'd show him just how unreliable she really was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit lighter after that unexpected eavesdropping session, I walked straight to the bar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just my luck, who should stroll out of the elevator? Laura.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had Hermes in hand, followed by Nicole carrying a lunchbox. Seemed like they'd just swung by and cooked some stew for Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We all bumped into each other head-on. I was caught off guard, couldn't even sidestep in time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood there feeling pretty awkward. And when Laura laid eyes on me, her gaze turned sharp. She came up to me in a hurry and whispered, "Madeline, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked tense, like she was facing down a foe, as if I might suddenly go after her unborn grandson.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="387.html">« Prev</a><a href="389.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
