Because of his behavior, I couldn't help but sneeze several times in succession.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Quinn was clearly caught off guard. I sprayed him with snot and saliva, causing him to scold me again.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Did I owe you anything in my last life? You ignored me and even sprayed snot on me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's tone was humorous. Despite my bad mood, I couldn't help but laugh at his words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learning about his efforts to find me, I was inexplicably moved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I still said angrily, "Why did you look for me? I won't disappear."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You suddenly stopped answering my calls for no reason and were still in a low mood. How could I not look for you? What if you committed suicide on impulse? You are so sensitive. No one knows what you might do," Quinn scolded me again. Then, as if by magic, he fetched a cup of hot chocolate from the car and handed it to me.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drinking something sweet when you are in a bad mood will make you feel better. It is hot and will warm you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took the hot chocolate from him. He inserted the straw into the cup. Probably fearing that I wouldn't drink it, he held my hand and put the straw directly into my mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a sip like a reflex and found that it was the flavor I liked. The hot chocolate tasted very sweet, and the temperature was just right.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why are you wandering alone in the street? It's not your style. What happened?" Quinn asked me again. At the same time, he ordered the driver to drive to his club.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Quinn, I didn't know what to say for a while. After all, it was not appropriate for me to tell a man about my disease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing," I continued to deny while drinking hot chocolate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your behavior doesn't correspond to your account. It looks like something serious has happened. If you don't tell me, I'll call and ask Elliott about it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Determined, he pulled his cell phone from his pocket, found Elliott's number, and was about to make the call.&#8203;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, I hurriedly stopped him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, don't call him!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then tell me what's going on. You know my character. I always have a way to get the information I desire."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn pressed me again, pretending to dial Elliott's number.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had been in contact with him for so long and already understood his personality. I couldn't defeat him at all, so I sighed heavily, took out the wrinkled report from my trouser pocket, and threw it in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have a look. Quinn, I may never be a mother in this life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want to cry. However, somehow, the moment I said these words, tears couldn't stop flowing from my eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="256.html">« Prev</a><a href="258.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
