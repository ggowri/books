I quickly grabbed his arm and asked loudly, "Hello, are you from Red Star Charity in Hoswich?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. You are?" The volunteer looked at me doubtfully, not understanding what I wanted to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great. Do you know Quinn? He is also a volunteer at Red Star Charity," I said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn?" The volunteer hesitated at first and then quickly reacted. "You are talking about Mr. Woods, right? Yeah, I know him. He is one of the founders of Red Star Charity. Are you his friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was delighted and nodded quickly. "Yes, I'm his friend. I can't contact him. I want to know where he is now and if he is safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There was a riot here a few hours ago. Mr. Woods tried to dissuade the people leading the trouble. As a result, they stabbed him in the abdomen. Fortunately, they didn't hit anything fatal. He was saved just now. I'll take you to his ward," the volunteer quickly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was stabbed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of unease once again soaked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurriedly said, "Okay. Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, under the volunteer's guidance, Hardy and I quickly left the crowd and walked to the fifth floor through the fire escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sent Adam and Leonel messages and asked them to go to the fifth floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The volunteer took us to the innermost ward on the fifth floor. Outside the ward, several people wearing red vests were guarding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained my purpose to those people. Learning I was Quinn's friend, they took me into the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time I had seen Quinn, who had always been lively, lying on the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medical conditions at Carthage People's Hospital were not very good. The ward looked very old. Even the paint on the hospital bed was mottled and came off, revealing rust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was half lying on the bed. His head was bandaged, and his upper body was naked. He had a thick gauze wrapped around his waist. There were several scratches on his arms, which were caused by the fierce fight before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Quinn was still awake and chatting with someone. As soon as I walked in, he turned his head and saw me. He was stunned for a moment and then suddenly yelled at me, "Madeline, are you crazy? You're pregnant. What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, I burst into tears when I saw him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately walked up to him and yelled at him, "You are crazy. You came to Carthage to help. Did you have to risk your life? Have you ever thought about what would happen if they hit a fatal part?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His suffering really broke my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking that he always showed up immediately whenever I was in trouble, I felt more heartbroken for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had never yelled at Quinn so loudly. My yelling stunned Quinn for a few seconds. Then, a typical, teasing smile appeared on his face again. "Do you feel sad to see me like this? I'm fine. It's a minor injury. I'll just rest for a few days. Come and sit here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While teasing me, he pointed to the chair beside the hospital bed and motioned for me to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, everyone might have misunderstood Quinn's and my relationship. They all left the ward, leaving only two of us.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="507.html">« Prev</a><a href="509.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
