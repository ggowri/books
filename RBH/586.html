We previously agreed that my family would support you through tough times, and in return, you promised not to raise prices for supplying NM motors for ten years. Is that correct?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the price quote from me, Elliott frowned and asked, "Is this the quote we provided to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed he was oblivious to the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sneered, "Is there any other possibility?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting the quote down, Elliott stared at me and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't been briefed on this. Let me investigate and get back to you, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a sense of disappointment crept into my heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "When Giselle was pregnant, he claimed ignorance. During the divorce proceedings, he said the same. And now, with prices suddenly skyrocketing, he still professed ignorance... Is he truly clueless, or is he employing tactics to evade responsibility?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out that despite loving him for so many years, I never truly understand him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My love for him stemmed from the passion within me. I never delved deep into understanding his true nature. So now, faced with this series of events, I found myself unable to pass judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, I said coldly, "Elliott, I realize now that you habitually portray yourself as blameless in everything that could hurt me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of confusion appeared in his eyes as he asked, "What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I chuckled, no longer interested in explanations. Some things, even when understood, needed not be vocalized. For speaking them out loud served no purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing. It's just that after parting ways, I discovered that I knew nothing about you, not even the kind of person you truly are. The 'you' I loved was merely a figment of my imagination. The real you remain a mystery to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Elliott rose from his seat, circled his desk, and stood before me, hands resting on the armrests of my chair, staring intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? But I feel that only now am I truly beginning to understand the kind of woman you are, gradually discovering your allure, Madeline. Can you explain this to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was close to mine, his eyes filled with a strong desire. I sensed a mix of love and hate, possession and fear in his gaze as if he wanted to have me yet feared losing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I coldly smiled, instinctively leaning back to maintain distance, resting my head against the chair back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't come here today to discuss this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what do you want to talk about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since our lives have diverged completely, and our careers have been severed as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Severed?" Elliott said mockingly, "You've already found a new partner in life, have you also found a new business partner for NM motors?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="585.html">« Prev</a><a href="587.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
