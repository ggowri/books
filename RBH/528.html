My hair, which had become disheveled from the struggle I had just passed through, almost hid my face, so I rushed to ruffle it with my hands.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Subconsciously glancing at Quinn's wound, I found that the gauze on his abdomen was indeed oozing fresh blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a hurry, I was just about to help him get the gauze off to check it out when Elliott had come to our side by then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood still and stared at Quinn, his body radiating an extremely icy aura that shocked Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold face, Elliott glared at Quinn for several seconds before asking, "Madeline came to Carthage because you were here, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, the scene just now was enough to make Elliott more certain about my relationship with Quinn. At this moment, Elliott was boiling with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn didn't forget the last time he and I had intentionally performed as boyfriend and girlfriend in front of Elliott. Instead of being frightened by Elliott's powerful aura, he tugged me into his arms intimately before Elliott and then frankly said, "Yeah. Learning that I was injured here, Madeline immediately rushed over and took care of me for several days. You're divorced from Madeline now. I don't suppose that would bother you, would it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was very calm, as if he and I had really been in a romantic relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;Elliott grew more and more furious.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She was so determined to divorce me because you've been involved in our relationship for a long time, right?" Elliott asked, as if desperately trying to prove something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn puffed out his chest. Despite knowing full well that his answer would hurt the years of friendship between him and Elliott, he said matter-of-factly, "You should know that you and Madeline aren't right for each other. You've told us yourself before that she's not your type. In that case, stay away from her. She deserves a better man who knows how to protect her better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I snuggled quietly in Quinn's arms but kept my eyes fixed on Elliott's face throughout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every subtle, imperceptible expression on his face was captured through and through. I could feel the complex, shifting emotions and pain inside Elliott as Quinn said those words.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long has it been?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was fully convinced that Quinn and I had been together. Otherwise, he would never have posed such a question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn was taken aback. After all, he and I had only been good friends so far. Elliott's question stumped him for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I left Quinn's arms and stood up. Staring at Elliott, I said calmly, "From the moment I found out that Giselle was pregnant with your baby. Elliott, I stopped caring about you a long time ago, and now that we're separated, let it go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, I was expressionless. However, my heart felt a pang, as if a needle had stabbed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, in Oliver's office, Elliott looked at me in the same way as ever, as if we had never parted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, I could feel that Elliott's eyes had become extremely unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glanced at Quinn and then at me before saying in a hoarse voice, "I never expect to suffer the betrayal of my wife and friend one day. You're heartless."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="527.html">« Prev</a><a href="529.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
