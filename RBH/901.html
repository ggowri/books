Your mom has mentioned him before, saying </span><span>he</span><span> is tall, handsome, and very considerate. </span><span>She&rsquo;s right about this</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My mom </span><span>mentioned</span><span> my boyfriend</span><span> to the landlady</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That </span><span>shouldn&rsquo;t be</span><span>. My mom never spoke so highly of Elliott, and we divorced a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be</span><span> Quinn</span><span> that my mom was talking about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt something bad was coming</span><span>, but Elliott seemed to enjoy the compliment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately put his arm around my shoulder in front of the landlady. Normally, he rarely initiated conversations, but </span><span>this time </span><span>he politely said to her:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for, ma'am. We'll come by often for breakfast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, wonderful! We're all neighbor</span><span>s, swing by </span><span>often&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The landlady was thrilled by </span><span>Elliott</span><span>'s politeness, rubbing her hands together and smiling broadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearing that their conversation might reveal more inconsistencies, I quickly </span><span>dragged</span><span> Elliott away after buying breakfast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect your mom to think so highly of me. Maybe they don't dislike me </span><span>so</span><span> much as you said. Are they testing me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> was still basking in the landlady's praise as he walked and asked me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea how to </span><span>tell him because</span><span> the truth was quite </span><span>hurting</span><span>. So, I chose to stay silent and kept walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The short walk of a few hundred </span><span>yards </span><span>felt like an eternity. Finally reaching the entrance of our</span><span> neighborhood</span><span>, I hastily </span><span>asked</span><span> </span><span>Elliott</span><span> to leave</span><span>:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, </span><span>we&rsquo;re</span><span> at the gate. You should </span><span>go</span><span> to work. I'll </span><span>also go to work after bringing the</span><span> breakfast to my parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Y</span><span>ou won't invite me in? It's been a long time since I saw your parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> looked at me, a bit hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's </span><span>still </span><span>early, and they're resting. </span><span>Noah</span><span> </span><span>had a</span><span> </span><span>fever</span><span> last night, and everyone was up all night. Maybe next time, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I frowned and refused again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott</span><span> seemed about to say something more, but just then, my mom's voice came from behind me:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, why are you standing at the gate? Malina said you went out to buy breakfast. Buy an extra one, Quinn said he..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly turned around and stopped her with eyes </span><span>when she mentioned "Quinn"</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, my mom saw </span><span>Elliott</span><span>. She froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, I saw her expression change rapidly from friendly to furious...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Elliott</span><span>, go to work now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the situation was bad, I hurriedly pushed </span><span>Elliott</span><span>, signaling him to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, </span><span>Elliott</span><span> didn't </span><span>move</span><span>. Instead, he stared intently behind my mom, his eyes suddenly turning terrifyingly cold.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="900.html">« Prev</a><a href="902.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
