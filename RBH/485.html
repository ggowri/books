It seemed that he was truly infuriated by me because he coughed up a mouthful of blood directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deep red splotches on the white tissue looked too shocking. I was taken aback, and at the same time, Elliott stood up once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, we're even, completely cut off... I never expected that after I developed genuine feelings for you, the blow you'd give me would be so devastating! Madeline, I've learned my lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word Elliott spoke was slow, and then he staggered away, clutching his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood at the staircase the entire time. Seeing Elliott walking unsteadily, he hurried over, trying to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, you're still weak, perhaps you should lie down and rest for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I appreciate your help this time, I won't cause you anymore trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott waved his hand, signaling to Marcus that he didn't need assistance. After thanking Marcus, he walked out unsteadily through the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared blankly at his departing figure, feeling as though the steel nail in my heart had pierced even deeper at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp pain struck my chest, and instinctively, I held my hands against my heart. I thought I wouldn't feel any pain, but I realized I had severely overestimated myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His departure this time was completely different from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had a hunch that after tonight, our relationship was utterly over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it not hurt?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the person I had loved for many years, someone I loved without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person had been with me through two lifetimes. In the previous one, he shattered me, and in this one, he nearly became my nightmare once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was letting go easy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone who truly loved and was deeply invested in another, cutting off that love was as painful as tearing apart the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who had truly loved could understand the taste of letting go, the kind of heart-wrenching, gut-wrenching taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door slammed shut with a loud bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like something heavy had dropped in my heart, and I fell to the ground, feeling dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the kindness that lingered from loving Elliott, I endured the discomfort and quickly sent Barry his location, asking Barry to come pick up Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was afraid this fool would once again drag his sick body into the cold wind, harming his health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, my phone slipped from my hand, and I collapsed weakly on the couch, feeling the world spinning around me, the ceiling becoming a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, I gradually lost consciousness. I could hear Marcus desperately calling my name, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't open my eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="484.html">« Prev</a><a href="486.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
