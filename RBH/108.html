Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a tall and slender figure standing silently at the door, but I didn't know when they had appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Elliott come?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was startled in my heart, and immediately focused my gaze. As a result, I actually saw Elliott standing there with his hands in his pockets, quietly. His gaze pierced through the crowd and landed directly on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I and him locked eyes, and neither of us looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, who was standing in front of me, realized something was wrong. He quickly glanced back and, upon seeing Elliott appear at the door, immediately stopped the music and shouted, "!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, when did you come over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Quinn shouted, everyone's attention was instantly drawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip and Paige also stopped dancing at this time, and they let go of each other's hands. They both looked towards the door, and Philip agreed, "Yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you came too late as well, missing out on the most fun part of our game."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott always exuded a strong presence, and whenever he appeared, even without saying a word, he instantly became the center of attention, capturing everyone's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing everyone looking at him, he walked over and went straight through the crowd, coming directly to stand beside me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced around the scene and understood what we had all been up to. So, he smiled and said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had a great time last night, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, everyone is rarely happy in the evening. Do you want to join us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled and extended an invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Elliott shook his head, then turned to look at me. Perhaps my hair tips were damp from the ice, but in front of everyone, he actually used a tissue to wipe the back of my neck, and then gently said, "They're going crazy because they're single. Why do you act like you've grown up, joining them in their madness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his words were criticizing, there was an inexplicable indulgence in his tone, as if an adult was scolding a disobedient child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't quite used to him showing his tenderness in front of so many people. I lowered my head and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does getting married mean we can't occasionally go crazy? I think it's nice and relaxing to be like this at night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had gotten used to contradicting him, but tonight, surprisingly, he didn't lose his temper and instead spoke softly:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you are happy, it's fine. However, you have been playing for so long, shouldn't you go home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gentle tone towards me, not to mention Paige and Fiona, made both of them uncomfortable. They exchanged a glance and then stared at Elliott with eyes as if he were an alien.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't tell us you came to pick up Madeline and take her home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, Elliott said naturally:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, which man would feel at ease with his wife playing out so late and not coming back home yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What? Wife?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, not only Paige and Fiona, but even Elliott's three good friends were startled by this word, and they all jumped up from the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, were you tricked?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, you actually speak human language?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, if you were being coerced by someone, just say it, we will definitely support you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn, Alexis, and Philip said that it was evident that Elliott's attitude towards me now was unbelievable, not only for my best friend but also for his own close friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, however, gave them a fierce glare. He seemed unwilling to explain so much and instead, in front of everyone, he grabbed my hand directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, let's go back early."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="107.html">« Prev</a><a href="109.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
