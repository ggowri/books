That's probably for the best, he likely wouldn't remember the child Laura mentioned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sigh of relief escaped my lips. I patted his shoulder, saying:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's alright," Dr. Muller said you just had an episode of insomnia, a fainting spell due to lack of sleep. All you need is a good night's rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing that, Elliott instantly relaxed, then double-checked:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing. What are you craving? I'll go grab it for you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I asked him with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I crave your homemade spaghetti. Once my IV drip is done, let's head home and you can whip it up for me, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's hand clasped mine. Likely due to the IV drip, his fingers were somewhat cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dr. Muller told me it would only take three months, the resistance within me suddenly settled down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through our time together, I've come to understand that the best way to keep Elliott's condition stable is to show him my kindness. Perhaps in this way, he might recover faster.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My attitude made Elliott extremely happy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped his arms around my waist, pulling me into his embrace, holding me tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the situation, Barry quietly slipped out of the sickroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, Elliott's IV drip was finished. I fetched a nurse to remove the needle. Then, I accompanied him back to Serenity Villa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We picked up some groceries from the supermarket near Serenity Villa. Once we got home, I started whipping up lunch for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kitchen remains as I left it, everything still arranged according to my old habits.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps under Elliott's orders, Sean hadn't touched anything here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fridge that was once packed to the brim by me, now stands empty. I open it, and the musty smell of long disuse hits me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, I noticed that the fridge still housed some of my previously used condiments. Only, they were long past their expiration date.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at the various kitchen utensils I had meticulously chosen in the past, a familiar sense of warmth washed over me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of this kitchen flooded my mind in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the woman who once willingly prepared meals for a man with all her heart, is long gone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite not having cooked for a while, everything felt second nature in this familiar place. In no time at all, I had prepared the meat sauce and boiled the pasta. Then, I served up two plates of aromatic and flavorful spaghetti, a feast for both the eyes and the palate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was on the phone, standing in front of the living room's floor-to-ceiling window.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was clad in a crisp white shirt and dark slacks, his legs straight as a rod, his back strong and upright. He was still the image I had in my mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sauntered over, about to call him for dinner, when I caught him saying into the phone:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, but my intention in partnering with you guys isn't to compete with Glory Group. I think, Ms. Fox, you might have misunderstood me. If that's your perception, then there's no need for us to collaborate!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I froze in my tracks, utterly astonished...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="846.html">« Prev</a><a href="848.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
