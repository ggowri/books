Therefore, she asked Quinn to accompany me and she took a taxi back to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn and I walked into the hospital, and at that time, Giselle had already been rescued and transferred to the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona had already inquired for me, and although Giselle was stabbed, the knife was just a steak knife, not sharp, and the wound was not deep, and did not harm any internal organs. Therefore, the situation was not considered serious, and she could be treated with bandaging at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Quinn and I entered the ward, Giselle was half lying on the bed, she had already regained consciousness, and Elliott was standing by her side, never leaving. On the table next to them, there were fresh fruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I walked over and asked lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, I'm fine. The wound wasn't deep, and the doctor said that resting for a week would be enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle seemed to be in a good mood. She lifted her head and even smiled sweetly at me. Her address was also very polite. I couldn't tell if she had any thoughts about Elliott at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, that's good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I politely responded, and at that moment, Elliott suddenly asked her:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, your name is Giselle? How come I feel like I've heard this name before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood straight and tall, even when I placed my hand on his shoulder, but he never turned to look at me. His gaze was fixed on Giselle the whole time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's charm, indeed, was strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but silently sigh in my heart again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bryant, do you know why I rushed over to save you regardless of everything that night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle looked at Elliott, with big sparkling eyes, and a hint of innocent naivety, like a schoolgirl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I found that when she faced Elliott, she had no sense of restraint that employees usually have when they meet their boss. On the contrary, she was very natural, as if she had known Elliott for a long time and understood him well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you remember, your father once had a driver named Baxter Cole?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle immediately asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When I heard this name, I distinctly saw Elliott's body tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Baxter's daughter? The girl that my family sponsored for education before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was extremely surprised, and he immediately blurted out the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am Giselle, Baxter's daughter. Toby, the driver who drove you, is my half-brother. Mr. Bryant, I am very grateful for your family's support. Without your sponsorship, I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to complete my studies or pursue my passion for piano. You are my benefactors, so as soon as I graduated, I chose to apply to the Bryant Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle said to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was injured. At this moment, her lips still appeared somewhat pale, and her whole person looked haggard. However, those large and lively eyes shimmered with tears, adding a touch of delicate beauty to her entire being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as a recent graduate, even without makeup, she still looked pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what she said shocked me to the core.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="58.html">« Prev</a><a href="60.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
