The recent excitement made me take a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's hand was still around my waist. He gently squeezed and said with a glint in his eye:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay now. They can't catch us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that was terrifying," I muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you even go to a bar in Korea? If I hadn</span><span>'</span><span>t shown up tonight, imagine the consequences..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said with a soft chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made me snap back to reality. I quickly looked up:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing in Korea? This is too much of a coincidence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My cousin is studying here and needed some help, so I came over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott looked at me, not like he was making it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I randomly chose to visit Korea, and he happened to be here too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And we both ended up at the same bar?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To top it off, his cousin must be the one who approached us, Orson...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could such coincidences really happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, feeling skeptical, "Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He winked at me, smiling playfully, "What do you think? Do you think I'm a stalker, following you every day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, "I'm very suspicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car was a bit stuffy. Elliott let go of my waist, and I immediately felt cooler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed and playfully tapped my nose:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then just think of me as one. I don't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is your cousin named Orson?" I asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked surprised, "How did you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't seem to be faking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He approached us at the bar tonight. What a small world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all seemed too coincidental, but Elliott's explanation made sense, leaving me no choice but to believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes the world is just that small. Do you know what that means?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott smiled, his lips curving into a charming arc.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The streetlights cast a soft glow on his face, half illuminated and half in shadow, making him look even more striking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, Elliott was still the most handsome man I had ever met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does it mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost got lost in thought, but thankfully, my rational side reminded me to stay calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It means our fate isn't over. How else could we end up abroad at the same time, in the same country, and meet in the same place? And I just happened to save you. If this isn't fate, what is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott said in a low, raspy voice, making it sound even more deep and sexy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes shone brighter, like stars in the dark, making me flustered and my heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly looked away, instinctively glancing out the window, and changed the topic:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, where is the driver taking us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know where you're staying, so I have to take you to my hotel first," Elliott replied softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? No, just help me contact Paige and Fiona."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of going to his hotel made my heart beat even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being with him made my blood feel thick, and the air turned charged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this atmosphere continued, I'd probably forget all my resentment and end up tangled with him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That</span><span>'</span><span>s not what I want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Elliott didn't insist. He took out his phone, but soon frowned, "My phone's dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his phone, and sure enough, the screen was black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was stunned, thinking he might be lying, so I took his phone and pressed the power button. It really was out of battery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this fate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stared at him, my heart still uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver stopped the car and spoke to Elliott in Korean. Elliott responded fluently and then told me to get out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I got out and saw we were at a fancy resort hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott couldn't pay with his phone, but he had some cash and paid directly, then led me into the hotel lobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, can you get me a separate room? I think it's better if we don't share one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As we were about to enter the elevator, the thought of sharing a room made me panic. I grabbed his sleeve and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, but did you bring your passport?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott asked, and I realized I hadn't brought my phone or passport; everything was in my bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a disaster. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed fate really wanted her to share a room with him that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott understood everything from my expression. He looked like a wolf who had seen through everything, and his face had a charming, hunter-like smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax, I won't eat you. Don't be so scared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He joked, making my face turn red instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what was wrong with me, why I blushed so easily tonight, feeling so flustered. Before I knew it, I was holding his hand, following him into the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott had booked the hotel's most luxurious suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suite was on the top floor, with a private butler at his service.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one dared to check his room or question who he brought. The butler eagerly welcomed us into the suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suite was not only luxurious but also spacious, with a stunning view of Seoul's nightscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Elliott bring a woman back, the butler quickly had a beautiful fruit platter delivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively grabbed a piece of fruit but noticed two small packages next to the platter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought they were disposable gloves, but when I picked one up to open it, I realized it was a condom...</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="921.html">« Prev</a><a href="923.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
