Madeline, I can't stand the thought of you with another man! The idea of you being with Quinn drives me insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, with bloodshot eyes fixed on me, despite my obvious resistance, held onto my waist tightly, leaning in to kiss me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, for God's sake, I'm pregnant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His madness sent a chilling fear down my spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I struggled desperately, pounding his chest with all my might, shouting at the top of my lungs. However, Elliott refused to let go, his eyes piercing into mine with a sharp intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The day you fainted, I had the doctor examine you. Based on the timeline, this child was conceived when we were together! Madeline, are you colluding with Quinn to deceive me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran through my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had a vague premonition that with Elliott's character, once he knew the exact date of my pregnancy, he would become suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as long as I denied it to the end, his doubts would be baseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, I let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, you're mistaken. I've already told you, this child has nothing to do with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're disappointed in me, so you say that. I don't blame you." Elliot seemed convinced the child was his. "Rest assured, I'll take responsibility. As for you and Quinn, whatever happened between you during this time, I consider you friends, but from now on, I expect you to keep your distance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, he adopted the tone of a domineering CEO.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if, even after our divorce, I was still considered his property, obliged to comply with his arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's words infuriated me. I couldn't help but burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, don't forget, we're divorced! We have no ties now. And I came here to make it crystal clear that I want nothing to do with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he seemed unfazed, as if my words had no impact on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this lifetime, I won't let you escape from me. So, give up struggling. I will give orders. NM motors' price will not rise. And I'll provide you directly at cost. Furthermore, if Glory Group needs funds, I can allocate the same two billion dollars that you sponsored the Bryant Group with back then, under the condition that from today onwards, you maintain distance from Quinn. Do you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Ha! Elliott is paying a hefty price to sever my ties with Quinn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a steep price was never mentioned during our divorce, yet he readily agrees now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, his promises hold no meaning for me anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bitter laugh, I said, "Elliott, I don't need your help. I've found a more suitable partner for those motors, and as for the two billion dollars, consider it the cost of keeping you all these years! Glory Group is financially sound now and will only thrive in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I deliberately delivered a cutting blow to Elliott's heart.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="587.html">« Prev</a><a href="589.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
