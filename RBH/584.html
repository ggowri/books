I inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's about something in the mechanical field. Our NM motor has been in collaboration with Bryant Group, and they've sent us the latest quote, claiming that raw material prices have increased, resulting in an overall price hike of ten points. Take a look, this is their quotation sheet, Madeline," Adam explained cautiously, handing over the quote.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Elliott had come to bother me earlier, now they were playing tricks in our collaboration to cause trouble for Glory Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took the quote sheet from Adam, glanced at the prices, and found it even harder to control my inner anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew very well that this motor was our core component and that we couldn't currently find other partners, so they deliberately used the excuse of raw material price increases to raise prices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is our contract with them about to expire? How much longer?" I inquired, looking up at Adam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's expiring at the end of this month, which is why they're proposing a price increase for future collaborations. And they also said..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did they say?" I sensed something amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They mentioned that the previous prices were due to the marriage relationship, so they hadn't increased. Now that you and Mr. Bryant are divorced, they'll base future prices on market fluctuations and won't be able to offer us the same rates as before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My unease grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected Elliott to stoop so low, disregarding our past support for Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I understand. You can tell Isaac not to worry about this. I'll handle it with them," I coldly stated, then stood up, grabbed my bag, and prepared to leave the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, where are you going?" Adam asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm heading straight to Bryant Group to find Elliott."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I left in a hurry, driving directly to the building of the Bryant Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since we were no longer married, I decided to clarify business matters upfront to avoid any additional disputes arising from work in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I made up my mind and walked into the lobby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was February and still cold, I draped a smoke-gray wool coat over my deep blue office lady suit, with a light gray fox fur collar wrapped around the neckline and wore a pair of low-cut black leather shoes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To accentuate my presence, I deliberately applied crimson lipstick before stepping out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As I entered the Bryant Group, I could clearly feel all the employees' eyes focusing on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had been here a few times before with Elliott and had even accompanied him in receiving the Dikio VIP group. At that time, the photos were used for internal promotion at Bryant Group, so most employees probably knew who I was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that Elliott and I were divorced, it was likely that everyone here had heard about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, as I stepped in once again, everyone's gaze held a mix of curiosity and scrutiny.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="583.html">« Prev</a><a href="585.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
