I couldn't help but exclaim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't know what Quinn ate. His lips had turned into sausage-shape. They were swollen, dark red in color, and wrinkled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, I found it funny, but then I suddenly became worried. I quickly approached him, intending to see what was wrong with his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Quinn suddenly reached out and grabbed my head, then planted a heavy kiss on my mouth with his "sausage lips".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was shocked and thought to myself, "Quinn actually kissed my face in front of Auntie Grey and Uncle Benjamin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he was acting, he was acting a bit too much, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his lips felt a bit strange. It didn't feel like lips at all. And, at the moment it imprinted on my lips, there was also a hint of sweetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I raised my head in confusion, and at that moment, I saw Quinn suddenly uncover the "sausage" in his mouth. Then, he burst into laughter at me and said, "Were you scared? Hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what were you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly jerked open his lips, which truly startled me. I couldn't help but let out a scream, and at that moment, his so-called "sausage" wiggled in front of me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I took a closer look and realized it wasn't a sausage at all, but actually a grape peel. Quinn deliberately stuck the grape peel on his mouth, so when I just saw him from a distance, I really thought his mouth had swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was still trembling with fear, unable to control myself. I pretended to be angry and gave him a hard punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are so annoying, you freaked me out! I actually thought something was wrong with your lips!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn burst into laughter instantly. "I was just kidding with you! Haha, don't I look like a character from a movie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finished speaking and once again put the grape skin on his mouth. At first glance, it really looked like a huge pair of lips, which was quite comical. I couldn't help but burst into laughter again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was about to say something else, but then I suddenly noticed that Quinn was looking ahead. He must have seen something, as he stood there motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, what are you looking at?" I asked instinctively, and then I followed his gaze to see what he was looking at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect it, but when I looked up, I saw Elliott standing right in front of us, about 50 feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing casual clothes, with a row of trees behind him, and the leaves rustled. The straight trees contrasted with his tall figure, appearing particularly harmonious, as if they were integrated and complemented each other, giving Elliott a unique charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he looked at us with extraordinary indifference. Even though there was a great distance between us, I could still feel the chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect him to appear here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was wondering, but he suddenly shouted my name, "Madeline, come here, I have something to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke in an indifferent tone, and was quite impolite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? What do you want to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My tone instantly became cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just made my mom's blood pressure rise, shouldn't you give me an explanation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stood with his hands in his pockets, his tone still carrying a hint of resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly realized... It turned out that he appeared here because of Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you want me to explain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come over, go to the hospital with me. If my mom is fine, then you'll be fine," he beckoned me with a wave of his hand and said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if your mom isn't fine? Do you want me to take responsibility?" I couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Elliott answered decisively, without any hint of compromise in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at him, and the chill in my heart became even stronger. It seemed that he was going to make me pay the price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, go ahead. It was indeed me who angered Laura just now. Since Elliott wanted me to take responsibility, I was curious to see what he really wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then I will go with you."</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="631.html">« Prev</a><a href="633.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
