So, no matter what I said, she could swallow her pride, all for the sake of her grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was utterly speechless, rolling my eyes inwardly, but thankfully, Grey came over to me just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Laura by my side, Grey wasted no time and strode over, grabbing my hand firmly and glaring at Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mrs. Bryant, what's the deal with you hovering around Madeline? She has nothing to do with your family anymore. Please do us a solid and keep your distance. The Woods family doesn't need any extra drama."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey and Carole surprisingly shared some similarities in character. Both could confront others without holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura probably didn't expect Grey to speak up for me. She was stunned for a moment, then with a doubtful tone, she said, "Grey, what's that supposed to mean? I was just talking to Madeline. What drama are you talking about with your family? Be clear about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want clarity, huh?" Grey squeezed my hand and raised an eyebrow at Laura. "Listen up, Madeline is with my nephew, Quinn, now. That girl you brought around last time, isn't she Elliott's wife? So, quit sticking your nose in Madeline's business, or don't be surprised if I stop being polite to your family, got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What nonsense are you spouting? Are you seriously suggesting Madeline is Quinn's girl? Get real. Madeline's been pregnant for three months, and she's carrying my grandson!" Laura said. She was shocked to hear Grey's words, her face turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Old lady, quit living in a fantasy. Madeline's carrying Quinn's baby. It's got zilch to do with your bunch. Are you losing it over a grandson? Don't you have some other wretch to pop out kids for Elliott? Leave Madeline alone." Grey immediately fired back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey's words made Laura stagger back in shock. Laura looked at me, her face filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, tell me, is what she said true? You and Elliott hadn't split three months ago, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Laura's astonished expression, I felt a strange sense of satisfaction, though I replied calmly, "This baby has nothing to do with Elliott, so quit the act. Your usual coldness has become my norm, and seeing you act halfway decent now feels off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Laura, I couldn't see her as an elder anymore. The memory of her previous heartlessness to me and her submissive attitude towards Giselle made even the exquisite desserts I had just eaten taste bitter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough, Madeline, let's not waste any more words on her. Come on, there's an interesting game going on over on the deck. I'll take you there to join in the fun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grey gave Laura a cold glance, no longer willing to engage with her. She took my hand, leading me out of the banquet hall, heading straight for the deck.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="572.html">« Prev</a><a href="574.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
