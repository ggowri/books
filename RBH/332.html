Move aside! How dare you getting so close with Madeline while Elliott is right here!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle taunted from Elliott's embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm talking to you! Move!" Elliott's voice grew more sternly as if his patience had reached its limit. He forcefully pushed Giselle away and came straight toward me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His towering presence seemed to dim the lights around us.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott quickly walked toward me, his gaze sharply scanning me from head to toe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the influence of alcohol, my cheeks started to burn, and I couldn't stand still.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Quinn was worried that I might fall, so he never moved his hand from behind my back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Elliott was clearly annoyed and yanked me into his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, how much did you let her drink?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott stared at Quinn, his tone cold as he interrogated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, my flushed cheeks and slightly tipsy eyes had really upset him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not much, just a couple of beers," Quinn responded calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you let her drink? You know it's not good for her health!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's frown deepened as he barked at Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His concern for my health would have touched me if I hadn't heard what Giselle had said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, now, I only found his words ironic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I drink is not your concern. You better take care of the person behind you. She was just bragging to her friend about marrying you! I won't disturb you two tonight. Quinn, let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately broke free from Elliott's grip and quickly stepped back to keep my distance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at Elliott's face, a face I knew all too well, I felt my heart was broken, and I couldn't stand being here another second.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We haven't cleared things up, and you just walk away?" Elliott's voice grew colder, and he firmly grabbed my arm when I turned to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, there's a lot we haven't cleared up between us. But it's too much. What now? You want to explain here what is going on between you and Giselle?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suppressed the turmoil inside me and looked at him coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just leave Madeline alone, Elliott. It's getting late. We can talk another time. Since we've bumped into each other, let me introduce you to my friends!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle moved closer to Elliott. She clung to his arm and deliberately called out in a sweet tone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could tell she wanted to prove to her friends that her relationship with Elliott was indeed close.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Elliott refused her. "Let go!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrenched his hand away from Giselle again, his eyes never leaving mine as if Giselle didn't exist at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another public rejection from Elliott left Giselle standing there with her face falling, awkwardly crossing her arms. Obviously, she hadn't seen it coming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, I thought Giselle said the Bryant Group CEO is her boyfriend? That doesn't look like it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he's totally ignoring Giselle, but seems worried about that other woman."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right? It's like he's married to her. What's really going on here?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="331.html">« Prev</a><a href="333.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
