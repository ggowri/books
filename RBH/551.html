I recalled that in my previous life, I was just like her, rushing to Elliott and trying my best to drag him home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, I was involved and didn't realize how embarrassed and humble I was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, I have seen Giselle by myself through the video and have realized how miserable I used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, I was an outsider. This status not only allowed me to watch the fun but also allowed me to experience the pleasure of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I knew very well that Giselle was on her way to self-destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everything she had done now, it was impossible for her to win Elliott's heart like she did in her previous life, but pushed Elliott away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadn't she been noble and sober in front of me before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then I found that she was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I clutched my phone, lying on the bed. When I was quietly reviewing my relationship with Elliott in the previous life, the baby in my belly suddenly moved slightly, as if telepathically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His movement was so slight that I almost thought it was just the movement of my intestines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, my body had never experienced such a feeling before. I could sense that it was a small life moving inside my body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a wonderful and indescribable feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously put my hand on my lower abdomen excitedly and felt it quietly. After a while, I felt the little guy moving slightly in my belly again as I expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This should be the so-called fetal movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected that I would be able to experience this magical feeling in my lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately turned on my phone and searched for information about fetal movements through various software. The joy of becoming a mother for the first time made me unable to control myself. I wasn't aware that it was getting late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About an hour later, I still didn't fall asleep, so I sent Fiona a message: [Fiona, how's it going?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona replied: [She's bleeding and is staying in our hospital. I suggest her to take a B-ultrasound, but she refused and insisted to let Dr. Louis come over. I suspect that there is something wrong with her child.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[What about Sylvia? Is she still there?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fiona texted back: [That woman soon slipped away quietly after coming to the hospital for a while. Elliott drank too much, and my colleague was doing a gastric lavage on him. Laura also came over. She was very angry when she heard that something happened to the child and said she wouldn't let Sylvia go.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I felt a little strange. Giselle knew that there was something wrong with this child, but why didn't she take this opportunity to have an abortion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, then I thought it might be because she hadn't been able to get married to Elliott.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she lost this child, with the attitude Elliott and the Bryant family had towards her, she could never have the chance to contact them again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect that Giselle</span><span>,</span><span>who easily won Elliott's heart in her previous life would have to rely on a child with Down syndrome to keep Elliott around her. Thinking of her cold and noble appearance in her previous life, I sighed in my heart.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="550.html">« Prev</a><a href="552.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
