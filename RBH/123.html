That doctor is well-known in the field of gynecology. If you want to take care of your body, it's right to see him. I will go and buy some for you in the next few days and deliver them to you then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole quickly smiled and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, I spent the afternoon with them on the stone bench in the orchard. The women chatted about the things that had happened in their daily lives, while enjoying fresh fruits. Soon, evening arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura wanted us to have dinner here, but I was a bit tired after a busy day. Giselle and Nicole also insisted on leaving. So Laura asked me and Elliott to take them home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott accompanied Jasper to play ball for the whole afternoon. He took a shower directly at the Bryant Villa and changed into new clothes. Then, he had Toby drive them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the road, Elliott and I sat side by side, while Giselle and Nicole sat in the back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I saw Giselle's gaze occasionally falling on Elliott through the rearview mirror. Shortly after, she suddenly said, "Elliott, I heard that our company will be hosting a large exhibition in Louis City soon, is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, we were already in the planning phase. Ms. Swift should have informed you, right?" Elliott said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Swift mentioned it during the last meeting. I really wanted to be involved in the early preparations for this exhibition, but Ms. Swift didn't choose to let me go. She felt that I lacked experience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle hesitated a bit and said, "She sounded very eager to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I could hear it, Elliott certainly heard it too. He turned his head and looked at Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to participate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle immediately nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I really want to go. However, Ms. Swift had already made arrangements. It's okay, I'll go next time if there's such an opportunity again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly wanted to go, yet she insisted on pretending that it didn't matter if she didn't. I couldn't help but feel that Giselle was really cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to go, you can go. I'll talk to Amy about it tomorrow," Elliott said directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but turn my head and give him a glance. Perhaps, the dream lover was really meant for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed very tolerant of all of Giselle's demands. If someone else made a request to him, he might not even pay attention. But with Giselle, even if she made a mistake, he didn't mind. He agreed to whatever she asked for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just started getting along, and they hadn't even started dating yet, but it was already like this. No wonder later, when they fell in love, he was so crazy about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I increasingly felt that Giselle, this opponent, was not easy to deal with, reminding myself to be careful in my mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott seemed to notice that I was looking at him. He suddenly turned his head and met my gaze directly. There was a hint of confusion in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. You're sweating a bit. Did you get tired from playing basketball? Let me wipe it off for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Giselle, I deliberately wiped the sweat off Elliott's temples with a tissue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott probably didn't expect me to suddenly make such a move. He instinctively murmured, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in the back seat, Giselle suddenly exclaimed, "Elliott, I realized that your relationship was actually quite good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were very meaningful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she inquire about our relationship and find out something?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, I deliberately asked her, "We have been married for many years, not as romantic as you young people. Giselle, how are you and your boyfriend doing?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="122.html">« Prev</a><a href="124.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
