I had just turned around, and she had already swiftly turned the corner and disappeared from my sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it was nighttime, the lights in the hotel corridor were not particularly bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I subconsciously wanted to catch up and take a closer look at her, but I also wondered if it was possible that I might have been mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the world is so big that all sorts of strange things could exist. Even if I encountered a woman who looked similar, it wouldn't be surprising, especially since this is a vacation hotel and the guests come from all over the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I put aside my doubts and returned to the hotel to the new room arranged for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After quickly washing up, I wanted to go to sleep. However, lying in bed, I tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although I had already discussed the preliminary plan with them, whenever I closed my eyes, the image of Quinn being immersed in a water dungeon would appear in my mind... It was so agonizing, I couldn't stay calm here at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it dawned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as it was daylight, I had Adam accompany me to the nearby bank to figure out a way to withdraw the money from my bank card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the plan we discussed with Dehan last night, we only withdrew two million dollars in cash from the bank. After bringing the money to the hotel, we separately spread the cash in several suitcases that had already been lined with newspapers, disguising it to look like there was ten million dollars inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Adam helped me load these few boxes onto the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering the special circumstances, it would be better if fewer people knew that we were going to Ruini this time. We didn't mention this to the other executives, we just said that Jane and I had to temporarily go somewhere else to meet someone, and asked them to continue with the original plan to go sightseeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Marcus looked at me seriously and reminded me repeatedly, "Madeline, you must be careful on this trip. You need to stay in constant contact with Dehan, report your whereabouts regularly, and keep your phone accessible at all times. Dehan has been investigating their backgrounds, and he said that if there is any situation, he will inform us immediately. In short, don't be afraid, with the military as your solid support, you will definitely be safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I understand. Thanks to your comrade, we wouldn't have been able to reach the border stationed troops at all. Marcus, thank you so much!" I gratefully said to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I increasingly realized that since my divorce, my world has been expanding continuously. I have been exposed to and involved in more and more things. I am no longer the ignorant person who was trapped in Serenity Villa before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to thank, now we should work together. Although we had military assistance </span><span>this time, Ruini is close to the Mexican border, so you must be very careful. Madeline is pregnant, Jane, you must take good care of her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus patted Jane's shoulder again and said to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is only now that I have noticed that Jane's gaze toward Marcus seems different from when she looks at others. I had not noticed this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to be quiet, but her eyes were bright when she looked at Marcus, and her voice was much clearer than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brown, don't worry, I will take good care of Ms. Mayers! I will never let anything happen to her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We quickly drove away from the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was driving the car, and I sat in the passenger seat as we headed toward Ruini.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after setting off, I took the initiative to call that woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are leaving for Ruini now, you tell me now, where do I need to put the cash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You told me your license plate number. After you got off the highway, you followed my instructions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't expect this woman to be so cautious. Not only did she not tell me the location, but she also asked me to provide her with my license plate number.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="731.html">« Prev</a><a href="733.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
