Elliott didn't look up, but there was clearly a hint of jealousy and anger in his words, and his reaction surprised me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott wasn't such a narrow-minded man... Didn't he used to dislike me getting involved in his relationships before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How come he himself has turned into this appearance now? Does he not have any self-awareness at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you treat her as your wife, naturally I will come to see her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn smiled and said, not considering himself an outsider, he directly handed me a bouquet of flowers that he had bought, and then moved a chair to sit in front of me: "How are you? Feeling better? I heard that you made a great contribution to the Bryant Group this time, impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn blinked at me, still wearing that cynical look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know who spread this matter, but it seems like everyone knows about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, my head was still aching a bit, but the doctor said there was no major problem," I quickly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No big deal, just glad you're okay. Look at you, either hurting your foot or hurting your head all the time. It all comes down to certain people not taking enough care of you," Quinn blinked at me, still wearing that nonchalant look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know who spread this matter, but it seems like everyone knows about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, my head was still aching a bit, but the doctor said there was no major problem," I quickly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm glad you're okay. Look at you during this period, either hurting your foot or hurting your head. In the end, it's still because certain people didn't take good care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn deliberately said with hidden meaning in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Quinn came in, Elliott's face hasn't been good. Hearing Quinn say this, Elliott's face turned even darker: "You don't have to speak if you don't want to, and you don't have to come if you don't want to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott clearly had a strong opinion about Quinn. Presumably, the incident when Quinn took me away last time had left him with unresolved anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn couldn't help but chuckle and patted Elliott on the shoulder, teasingly saying, "You don't seem like a man with such a narrow mindset. What's up, have you been preoccupied with your wife lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glared at him and said, "So you do know who she is, I thought you didn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn couldn't help but burst into laughter: "Elliott, it's hard to imagine that one day you would be jealous of me, hahaha..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott instantly ignored Quinn, stood up, and walked to the window, pretending to have a serious expression as he stood there, hoping that Quinn would disappear on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I watched him like this, and then looked at Quinn's playful expression, and I increasingly felt that they were two people with completely different temperaments and personalities. I also didn't know how these two people, who were so different, became brothers in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I remember correctly, in the previous life, Elliott, Quinn, Alexis, and Philip were all childhood friends. Among these people, his relationship with Quinn was the closest, and they also spent the most time together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Quinn wasn't worried that he would actually get angry, which is why he dared to mock him so brazenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bought some fruits, do you have anything you want to eat? Or should I peel an apple for you?" Seeing the air gradually becoming quiet, Quinn broke the silence and asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, how come you have time to come over today?" I nodded and asked with a smile.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="168.html">« Prev</a><a href="170.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
