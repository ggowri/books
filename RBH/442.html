However, I couldn't definitely go there this year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin just woke up, coupled with many things to sort out at the company. More importantly, I was pregnant now, so I had to put my health first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No. I hope you will have fun. How is Rowan now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I heard Adam mentioned Rowan, so I asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam shrugged helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was certainly that he was hit hard, having never recovered. Madeline, in fact, he wanted to talk to you, but I told him you have no time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did he want to talk to me?" I felt very surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Probably, he felt that he was in the same situation as you. Madeline, I am curious about a question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at me, Adam hesitated to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on with you and Elliott now? I heard from Rowan that Giselle and her family moved into a brand-new apartment. And now, she drives the sports car belonging to the Bryant family. You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Adam's voice unconsciously lowered again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he was afraid that I would be sad after hearing these things, so he dared not to ask any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're almost at the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I whispered in response. Then, I subconsciously picked up the water glass, wanting to drink some water to cover up the pain in my heart. But I never expected that a wave of nausea would sweep over me again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help it, so I turned and vomited into the trash can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With more and more severe morning sickness, I almost lost my appetite. And even I vomited out the glass of milk I drank in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing my sudden vomiting, Adam panicked in an instant. Quickly coming around to me, he patted my back gently and asked me what was wrong with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took me a while to vomit before I felt much better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adam quickly handed me a tissue. I wiped the corner of my lips. Then, I looked up again. Maybe it was because my face was too pale. He was startled, quickly saying to me,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, you look pale now. I'll take you to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I just need to take a break. I'll leave you to your work. I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By shaking my head, I signaled that Adam could do his own business first. After all, I was unwilling to expose my pregnancy to too many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm worried. I have to take you to the hospital. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I never expected Adam would persist in it. Moreover, he helped me up from the chair, forcefully dragged me out of the office door, and dragged me into the elevator. It seemed that he would be relieved after taking me to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Undoubtedly, I was no match for a man who was 6ft. So, even though I kept refusing, he still dragged me downstairs regardless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without much rest recently, coupled with the fact that I just vomited, I felt very weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Adam sensed my weakness. He simply squatted down before me and carried me on his back. Then, we walked out of the door of Glory Group in this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, please put me down. It will be discussed for you to do so. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was taken aback. And I was on Adam's back after reacting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are sick and can hardly walk. Why can't I carry you? Who dares to talk of us behind our backs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any worries, Adam just strode forward, carrying me on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adam, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wanted to say something more, but I was forced to stop. A tall figure suddenly appeared before us, casting a shadow and being in our way.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="441.html">« Prev</a><a href="443.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
