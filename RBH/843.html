It's my work, not like I need to report to you or anything," I said, a hint of annoyance in my voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was pacing around the room, ready to head out to the hallway. I quickly grabbed his arm, "Shouldn't you be with your client? What are you doing wandering around here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just saw them out, Madeline. Did your client bring a baby? Why is there a baby bottle?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Elliott stick around, but he also noticed a baby bottle on the table, recently emptied by my son.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That baby bottle? It was left behind by Lily in her rush.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, the client just had a newborn," I explained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To prevent his endless questioning, I immediately grabbed his arm and yanked him out of the room. "Enough, no more questions. It's getting late, and you've had quite a bit to drink. You should head home and get some rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott reeked of booze. As soon as I got close to him, I could smell the potent mix of alcohol and cologne on him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, I suppose you wouldn't dare to do anything shady behind my back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott lowered his gaze, scrutinizing my face with lingering doubt in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Barry was still waiting outside the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly shouted at Barry, "Barry, what are you waiting for? Mr. Bryant's had too much to drink. Get him to the car, pronto!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madeline, aren't you coming back with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Elliott had quite a bit to drink, his mind remained sharp. At my words, he halted again, fixing me with his gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was just about to explain when a text message popped up on my phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already seen your folks off to their car, you alright? I'm waiting for you downstairs."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I glanced down at the text message just as Elliott leaned in closer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He too saw the content of the text message, and he knew it was a message from Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly blurted out, "So, you were just having dinner with Quinn, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott abruptly turned me around, interrogating me. His piercing gaze held a hint of sadness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could respond, he swiftly let go of me, turning on his heel and striding towards the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, hold up!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hurried to catch up, but Elliott was fast. In the blink of an eye, he was already down the stairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time I caught up at the front gate, Elliott was already standing before Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before I could even process what was happening, Elliott had already swung a punch at Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching as that heavy fist was about to land on Quinn, I yelled out in panic, then immediately sprinted over:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn, watch out!"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="842.html">« Prev</a><a href="844.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
