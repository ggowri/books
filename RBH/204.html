Could it be that Elliott was the one taking the pictures?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that thought, I couldn't help but shiver. My wild imagination forced my mind to start racing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Has their relationship developed to the point where they can be alone together late at night?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that they've already become physically intimate?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so, why did Elliott take a two-day off from his work and rush to Louis City to be with me today?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly is he planning? What is he thinking?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but look up and stare intently at Elliott, and the tumultuous emotions inside me forced me to push him away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I said, "It's a bit hot. Maybe we should keep some distance."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Giselle's Instagram, the closeness we had just begun to feel suddenly drifted away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott didn't notice anything unusual. He thought I was actually feeling hot, so he let go of me. "Alright, it's almost our turn."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, it was our turn to check out. Elliott quickly paid, and the cashier put our items in a large shopping bag. I instinctively reached to carry the bag, but he swiftly picked it up and took my hand, pulling me toward the supermarket exit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I then stared blankly at his back. As I felt the warmth from his palm, my mind became a mess again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sighed inwardly, "So, just one picture from Giselle can make me lose my cool, make it hard to control my emotions. It seems I'm still not skilled enough. Since she purposely posts the picture to provoke me, why can't I do the same to her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after, a thought popped into my mind. I took a photo of Elliott's back and our joined hands and then posted it along with the earlier photo of us on Instagram.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I made sure that only Giselle could see these two photos, and I added a sentimental caption: [Being there for someone is the ultimate declaration of love.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After posting on Instagram, I put away my phone and returned to the apartment with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We stored the groceries and other items we bought, and then I picked up the ingredients and walked into the kitchen, only to suddenly hear Elliott's phone ringing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, a strong intuition told me that it was Giselle calling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quickly turned off the tap and instinctively walked to the kitchen door to listen closely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Elliott's voice resounded from the living room, and he was indeed talking to Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "What's up, Giselle? Do you need something?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't hear what Giselle said on the other end, but Elliott continued, "Okay, don't panic. I'll handle it when I get back."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, I heard him say, "I can't come back today. The earliest I can return is the day after tomorrow. If you can't handle it, ask Barry to help you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Elliott promptly hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From his words, it seemed Giselle had some urgent matter and wanted Elliott to return to Hoswich tonight, but he refused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing footsteps approaching the kitchen, I quickly went back to my position and turned on the tap to start washing the vegetables.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott came up behind me and suddenly wrapped his arms around my waist. The sudden closeness made my body tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "I think this is how a married couple should live, don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off-guard and still adjusting my emotions, I could only hurriedly agree, "Yeah."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me cook you a couple of dishes tonight. I want to give it a try," Elliott excitedly whispered near my ear.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="203.html">« Prev</a><a href="205.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
