It left me wondering what was really on his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he thinking about the kid Giselle claimed was his, making it tough for him to put his foot down even after seeing all this?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought devastated me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling like a kicked puppy, my pride took a serious hit. I couldn't stomach sticking around here any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, let's go. Quinn, mind giving us a hand getting Dad into the car?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I mumbled to Mom, avoiding eye contact, then turned to Quinn. With that, I headed over to Dad's hospital bed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before I could even reach him, Elliott was right there, blocking my path with a frown. He whispered, "Madeline, Austin's treatment is making progress. If you move him now, it could mess things up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I shot him a cold look. "I'm leaving. I won't let someone else push me out like some stray. Back off!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Elliott reached out to steady my shoulder, his voice low. "I won't let this slide. Whoever tries to pull this crap on you, I'll make sure they regret it. Madeline, trust me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Made them regret it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't help but laugh bitterly. Honestly, I didn't have it in me to believe a word that came out of Elliott's mouth anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I jabbed a finger towards Giselle, my tone as frosty as an ice cube.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously? The one who's been causing all the trouble is standing right there, but you're gonna let her slide? Come on, Elliott, you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elliott just stood there, pushing my hand down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened, and he shot a chilling look Giselle's way. It sent shivers down my spine, for real.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, I'm pregnant, still trying to protect the little bean in my belly...."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle saw me pointing at her and panicked, waving her hands like she was innocent as a saint.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Elliott, Giselle's pregnant, the Bryant heir. You gonna rough her up because of Madeline?" Nicole chimed in, looking all flustered as she jumped to Giselle's defense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bryant heir? Are you sure about that?" Elliott chuckled coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Giselle's collar, throwing the question out there for everyone to hear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, come on, don't you trust me after all this time?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's face paled as Elliott's anger boiled over. She trembled like a leaf, looking up at him with pure fear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you say so, this kid is really mine? Giselle, I've treated you like a sister all these years. I've treated your family like my own, and now you're stirring up trouble between me and my wife?" Elliott's voice cut through the tension, cold and sharp.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Elliott dropped the act and laid it all out, asking Giselle straight-up in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About time... This whole mess should've been sorted ages ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle looked like she was about to crack, trembling like a leaf and on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elliott, this baby is yours. How could you forget everything we've been through?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you make such accusations!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's voice roared as Giselle finished speaking. The whole room felt the shockwave.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="394.html">« Prev</a><a href="396.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
