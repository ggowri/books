Even later on, Jasper and Laura, because of their fondness for her, provided her with a dedicated driver and a special car for transportation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already being treated like a princess even before she got together with Elliott. It wasn't until the end that I realized this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life, no matter what, I couldn't let her continue to behave like this in front of Jasper and Laura. Otherwise, given their current situation, it wouldn't be long before Giselle could once again achieve the treatment of the previous life and become the adopted daughter of the Bryant family, holding a strong position in the hearts of Jasper and Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I fell into deep thought for a moment. Seeing that I remained silent for a long time, Elliott thought I was sitting alone and bored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he said lightly, "Are you bored? Wait a moment, you and Giselle accompany my mom to the backyard. I will play some ball with my dad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately came to my senses and said, "Okay, sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I almost forgot. Giselle, you came just in time. There are many fruits ripe in the backyard. Pick some to take back later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura quickly said. Then, she got up and led us to the backyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yard behind the Bryant Villa was very large. It is currently autumn, and various fruit trees in the yard have produced a lot of fruits. The sight of the fruits hanging from the branches is quite delightful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was probably because Laura liked Giselle too much. Ever since Giselle appeared, I suddenly found myself back in the same neglected treatment as in the previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura held Giselle's arm throughout the journey, while Nicole and I followed behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle said she liked to eat oranges, and she immediately had someone pick a large basket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle said she liked to eat lettuce, and she had someone pick a big basket of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I silently followed behind. The feeling of home that I had just started to experience was completely gone at that moment. Laura was only focused on talking to Giselle all the way, and only at the end did she finally remember that I was following behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura then said to me, "I almost forgot about Madeline. Madeline, what do you love to eat? I will have them pick it for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I had been treated like this in the past, I would have definitely gotten angry on the spot and expressed my dissatisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I have already experienced the warmth and coldness of human relationships, and I have already learned not to easily show my emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I immediately approached and pretended to affectionately hold Laura's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, why are you being polite to me? I come back every day and I can pick whatever I want to eat myself. Besides, you always have someone deliver it to us. Giselle has come all this way, so it's only right that you take care of her more. Giselle, take a look and see what else you want to eat. Don't be formal with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I directly assumed the role of Mrs. Bryant and said to Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura burst into laughter instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right, Madeline. Giselle, whatever you want, just say it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly satisfied with my generosity now, Laura immediately said to Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laura, enough is enough. Didn't you say that I should treat this place as my own home? From now on, I'll come back and take whatever I want to eat, just like Madeline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle was really amazing, she was very good at coaxing elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately stepped forward and grabbed Laura's other hand, smiling as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the calm girl in front of me, I increasingly realized that she was much deeper than I had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was too foolish in my past life, no wonder I wasn't her match. In the end, I didn't even know how I died at her hands. She just ended my miserable life like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great. I just love it when you guys are like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura was delighted by our coaxing. I laughed with Laura, but I clearly noticed Giselle staring at the pearl necklace around my neck out of the corner of her eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, I clearly saw a hint of envy flash in her eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="120.html">« Prev</a><a href="122.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
