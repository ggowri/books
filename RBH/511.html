I comforted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn might have felt the mood was very subdued. He raised his head again, touched my head, and smiled, "Well, it's been so many years. I should move on. Forget about the distressing matters. Madeline, I'm very touched that you came here today, but the hospital is not safe. I will ask someone to find you a place to stay. You can go and rest now and go back to Hoswich early tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm not going anywhere tonight. I'll stay here," I refused firmly at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The medical conditions here are poor. There is only a small bed for the visitor. You don't have to stay here. Besides, there are so many strong guys guarding me outside. I can't put you through this," Quinn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's different. Anyway, since I'm here, I must stay here and take care of you until you heal," I said with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be stubborn. You're pregnant. It's not good for you to stay in the hospital for a long time. Besides, it's crowded outside, and it's very dangerous here. Don't let your emotions get in the way," Quinn still disagreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Experts say that people who have recovered from the virus have been immune. I'm not joking about my health. Quinn, let me stay. Every time something happened to me, you were the first to show up. Now, you're injured, and I can't stand by and watch." I insisted again and again on not leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn glanced at me and sighed, "Be good. If something is wrong with you, how will I explain it to your parents?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I explain it to your parents if something happens to you? Don't talk me out of it. I've made up my mind. If you don't let me stay in the ward, I can stay in the corridor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. I can't stop you. But you have to promise me that no matter what happens outside, you must stay in the ward and not go anywhere. You don't have to buy anything. I will tell them to buy whatever you need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn had no choice but to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I looked at his helpless look and laughed mischievously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Adam and Leonel rushed upstairs. They pushed open the door and said, "Madeline, the number of patients is still increasing, and the hospital's medical staff is facing desperate shortages. The three of us want to go to support. In addition, I have called Mr. Hall and asked him to try to allocate a batch of anti-flu capsules here. Otherwise, the situation will be out of control if this continues."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see. What had Isaac said? Did we have sufficient anti-flu capsules?" I quickly stood up, turned around, and asked seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although our drug had just been put into mass production, we currently had a large number of orders, and the demand was already exceeding the supply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hall said he would try to allocate part of drugs to help here," Adam said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. If Isaac allocates the drugs here, you reserve part of them. We must give priority to ensuring that medical staff and volunteers can receive timely treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I got it, Madeline!" Adam nodded and immediately went to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sat down again. Originally, I wanted to chat with Quinn for a while, but I found he had fallen asleep probably because he was too tired.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="510.html">« Prev</a><a href="512.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
