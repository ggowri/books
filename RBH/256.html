Are you at Hoswich? If you are, I'm picking you up, and we're having dinner together tonight."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's tone remained assertive, as if he had already decided I would accept his invitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not in the mood, I don't want to eat," I replied weakly, lacking energy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quick to pick up on my unusual demeanor, Quinn asked, "What's wrong? What happened? Where are you now? I'm coming to find you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, Quinn. You go about your business, I just need some time to myself," I replied, declining his offer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I appreciated his concern but was not ready to face anyone at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden inspection had thrown all my plans into disarray. My mind was a mess, and I just wanted to be alone, quietly thinking about what I should do next.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up again, I switched my phone to silent mode, tucked it into my pocket, and continued wandering the streets.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "Elliott still hasn't called me. I can imagine his disappointment upon receiving the test results.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know his lack of affection towards me. Discovering my serious infertility issue will likely lead to a swift decision from his end.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems inevitable that divorce is our fate, regardless of my efforts to delay it and hinder his progress with Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He is probably consulting with Jasper and Laura to strategize their next steps. It won't be long before I'm pushed out." The mere thought of it made me tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sky darkened, neon lights illuminated the city once more. Lost in my thoughts, I strolled aimlessly, only to find it suddenly drizzling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Couples with umbrellas and parents with children crowded the streets, leaving me feeling like the loneliest and most helpless person in the city.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I stood in the rain, letting the water soak me. The rain intensified, but I had no desire to seek shelter. I just wanted to let the downpour wash over me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of blankness, as I struggled to control my actions, a large black umbrella appeared above my head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a familiar voice roared in my ear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you out of your mind? Why are you being so immature? It's pouring, why aren't you seeking shelter indoors?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rainwater streamed down my face, blurring my vision. Before I could see clearly, a coat was draped over me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the voice, I recognized Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had no idea how he found me in the busy streets, but before I knew it, Quinn had forcefully ushered me into a car.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the car, the heater was on, and Quinn grabbed a white towel, roughly wiping my face and head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then yanked off my coat and wrapped me in a blanket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening my eyes, I saw him sitting in front of me, looking angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't answer my calls, stand in the rain alone. Do you think you're still young? Do you realize how much effort I put in to find you?"</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="255.html">« Prev</a><a href="257.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
