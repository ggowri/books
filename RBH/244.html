The pink takeout box in his hand suggested he was heading to deliver a meal to Giselle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hadn't expected that while Giselle was flirting with Elliott, she was also entertaining Rowan's advances.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Rowan's humble and devoted demeanor, I couldn't help but realize I had underestimated Giselle's capabilities. She had a way of manipulating various individuals effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott, noticing my continued gaze out the window, skeptically asked, "What are you looking at?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I pointed towards Rowan's figure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that Giselle's boyfriend? Seems like he's specifically going to the hospital to deliver food to her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott glanced out the window, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know that's Giselle's boyfriend? Are you sure you're not mistaking someone else?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I be mistaken? He's wearing the Alexis Law Firm uniform. Besides, I had dinner with him in Louis City once. There's no way I could be wrong," I asserted confidently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why were you having dinner with Giselle's boyfriend?" Elliott asked, clearly puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My assistant was his university classmate, so I helped him get a job. As a gesture of thanks, he treated me to dinner. Why, did you think I was deliberately trying to get close to her boyfriend? I'm not that bored," I replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't mean that, it just seems a bit odd," Elliott said, then asked meaningfully, "Giselle's boyfriend works at the Alexis Law Firm because of your referral?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, not seeing a reason to hide my assistance to Rowan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, his work capabilities are average."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott remained silent, and when I turned to look again, Rowan's figure had disappeared from the street.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The flavors of the dishes here are quite good. Try this piece of steak. It's cooked to perfection."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott suddenly offered, spearing a piece of steak and placing it on my plate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I nodded, picking it up and taking a bite. The taste was indeed delightful, with a great texture, showcasing the chef's exceptional baking skills.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's expression softened, and then he suddenly said, "I know today's events were abrupt, but I hope you won't blame Grandpa. His only wish now is to have a great-grandchild. Also, during this hospital stay, I arranged for the doctors to conduct a comprehensive examination, revealing signs of his lung cancer relapse. The doctors said that at this rate, his life expectancy may not exceed two years."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott rarely displayed his emotions, but as he spoke, his eyes unexpectedly welled up with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this news, I was shocked and deeply distressed. Unable to contain my emotions, I blurted out, "Isn't there any other solution? With today's advanced technology, there should be other methods available."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He underwent a similar surgery a few years ago, and the doctors then said that once the disease relapses, it becomes uncontrollable. So, to fulfill his wish, we need to hurry and start preparing for a grandchild. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott once again brought up the request, and his reasoning made it impossible for me to refuse. After all, this was the dying wish of a man nearing the end of his life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suddenly set down my fork, feeling hesitant in the face of this new revelation.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="243.html">« Prev</a><a href="245.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
