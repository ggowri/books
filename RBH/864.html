Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura knelt before me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I almost doubted my own ears... Did I hear that right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to love bossing me around, acting all high and mighty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nowadays, no stone is left unturned just to see the grandson&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if she knew all along, why did she have to treat me like that in the first place?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many mistakes are irreparable, no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The act of kneeling, if it had happened in the past, might have softened my heart. But now, it only serves to surprise me a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I slowly turned around, only to find Laura genuinely kneeling on the ground, her head tilted upwards, pleadingly gazing at me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In recent years, I've scarcely taken a good look at her. Now, I realize, the wrinkles on her face have multiplied, and her hair is peppered with white strands. She appears significantly older.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I reached out to steady her, murmuring softly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't about kneeling, and I don't need you to kneel. Noah is a child of the Mayers family, he has nothing to do with you. So, there's no need for this."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Belongs to the Mayers family, right? So, no connection with the Woods family, correct?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura quickly picked up on the hidden meaning in my words, exclaiming excitedly:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew it! That kid couldn't possibly be from the Woods family. Otherwise, they would've taken him away by now. Why on earth would they still need to visit your house to see the kid?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura excitedly grabbed my hand, pulling me to my feet, her joy was palpable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to admit, her train of thought is pretty clear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems she didn't sleep a wink last night. She must have spent the entire night under the covers with Huo Tingyu, analyzing and strategizing, which led to this meal today.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've said all there is to say, but before I go, I'll leave her with a reminder:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's nothing else, I'll be on my way. But let me stress this again, my presence with Elliott is solely due to his illness. If you stir up my emotions, it's not going to do him any good. I hope you think twice before doing anything out of line!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, I know! Just hold on a sec, Madeline."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura spun around to locate her glasses, slipped them on, then proceeded to open her bedside drawer. From within, she retrieved an old-fashioned, perfectly square box.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sauntered over to me, box in hand, and popped it open. Nestled inside was an amulet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This talisman is composed of two parts. The main body is a golden bracelet, from which dangles a tiny fist made of red coral. Laura says:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Bryant family's heirloom amulet, once worn by Elliott when he was a child. Take it and put it on your kid, it's meant to keep them safe. Elliott barely fell ill as a child, he was incredibly healthy."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she took out the amulet and placed it in my hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This amulet appears to be of ancient origin, likely a genuine family heirloom. The quality of the carnelian is superb, devoid of any flaws. The carving of the tiny fist is also exquisitely done. It's clearly a priceless treasure at first glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura is surprisingly generous this time!</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="863.html">« Prev</a><a href="865.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
