I can handle it myself. You should eat too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wasn't quite comfortable with this level of intimacy with him. So, after taking my second bite of the burger, I gave a casual wave of my hand, signaling him to help himself to more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I quietly picked up the cola that Barry had bought and started to drink. Seeing this, Elliott didn't insist on continuing to feed me. Instead, he nodded and began to eat himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We sat across from each other, sharing breakfast. The gentle sunlight streamed through the window, bathing us in its quiet glow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was at this moment that Quinn barged into the hospital room. He abruptly pushed open the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Elliott and I tucking into our breakfast, his tense expression finally eased a bit:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Elliott okay? I had a bit too much to drink last night. As soon as I woke up and found out what happened, I rushed right over."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly still cares about Elliott from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott's face was a mask, revealing no emotion:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, no need for your concern."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn paused for a moment, then his face regained its composure. He walked towards us. Seeing us having breakfast, he, who was never one for formalities, grabbed a burger and stuffed it into his mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a relief. If anything had happened to you, I wouldn't know how to explain it. Everything I said last night was because I was drunk. Don't take any of it to heart."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn started making amends for his words last night, he must have realized he misspoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott furrowed his brows, a hint of irritation lacing his tone:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure it's just because you're drunk? Not slander? You claim I've lost my memory, that I'm faking illness. Why on earth would you say such things?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott was oblivious to the fact that he had a blood clot in his brain. To keep him from suspecting anything, Barry and I had already conspired in hushed whispers, assuring him that his fainting spell the previous night was merely due to low blood sugar.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was plastered last night. I can't even remember what I said. Elliott, you know me, I talk nonsense when I'm drunk. Don't take a drunkard like me too seriously."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn scrambled to cover his tracks, simultaneously offering an apology to Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I was genuinely concerned that Elliott would probe into Quinn's words from last night. Even more so, I feared that the mention of "Noah" would arouse suspicion. And worst of all, I was afraid that even after sobering up, Quinn might refuse to back down and apologize.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Quinn's attitude puts me at ease quite a bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know, he only bent the knee to Elliott because of me. Otherwise, I can hardly imagine him uttering such words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that really so?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elliott frowned at Quinn, still somewhat skeptical.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fainted due to low blood sugar. Forget about Quinn's drunken ramblings. Don't overthink it. I'm planning to head back to Hoswich City today. What about you guys?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I didn't want Elliott to dig any deeper into this matter, so I swiftly changed the subject.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To my surprise, when I asked them, Elliott and Quinn chimed in unison:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, I'll go back to Hoswich City with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's upbeat attitude was seriously grating on Elliott's nerves. Once again, he shot Quinn a warning glance:</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I instinctively glanced at Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know, he must be uneasy about me being alone with Elliott.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Elliott's condition has just stabilized. We're still in the dark about the specifics of his illness. We'll have to wait until we get back and let Dr. Jones complete his examination. Only then will we know the real reason behind his fainting spell last night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't want to provoke him at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though I had zero desire to journey back with him, it seemed I was currently out of other options.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I suppose I have to play along with his charade after all.</span></p><div class="pagination"><a href="821.html">« Prev</a><a href="823.html">Next »</a></div></div></body></html>
