  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne&#x27;s words left everyone bewildered.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It felt impossible for Ryan to send messages every time he trained.</p><p style="text-align:left;">During this period, they had all been crammed into a single suite, and Ryan had always trained right in front of them. How could they have missed him sending messages?</p><p style="text-align:left;">But when they turned to look at Ryan, they noticed there was a hint of panic on his face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Beads of sweat dripped down his forehead, and he didn&#x27;t seem to realize it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Yet, he clenched his jaw and insisted, &quot;You&#x27;re spouting nonsense! I always train in front of Nathan, Kaden, and sometimes Queenie, even your sister! How could I have secretly sent any messages?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne sneered, &quot;Who said anything about secret messages?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Isn&#x27;t that what you just implied?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I said you used your cultivation to pass along information, not that you did it in secret! I&#x27;ve spelled it out for you, yet you&#x27;re still trying to argue?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ryan was stunned, sweat beading more and more on his forehead.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone could tell something was wrong now, falling silent as they stared at Ryan in disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isaac let out a sigh. &quot;Osborne, just tell us straight. How did he do it? Even I was fooled.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne nodded with a smile. &quot;It&#x27;s pretty simple. It&#x27;s Morse code! Ryan&#x27;s power is gravity control. He likes to suspend a heavy object in mid-air with an iron chain and then crank up the gravity until the chain snaps. The object falls to the ground with a sharp crack. You all know this, right?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nathan nodded eagerly. &quot;Yeah, I know! I even told Ryan to find another training method because the noise was disturbing people. But he insisted it was the fastest way to improve his powers. He said he needed to get stronger quickly to protect the grades.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I was so inspired by him back then that I decided to train even harder.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After Nathan finished speaking, the others nodded in agreement.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They had all seen Ryan training, so they knew exactly how he did it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne sneered, &quot;The way Ryan was sending messages was through those thudding sounds! By controlling the timing of each fall, he could transmit information using Morse code.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The person he&#x27;s talking to lives right below us. All they have to do is listen to the intensity and rhythm of Ryan&#x27;s training, and they can decode his messages.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Am I right, Ryan?&quot; Osborne said with a smirk.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone&#x27;s jaws dropped as they turned to stare at Osborne.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, all eyes shifted to Ryan.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They wondered if Ryan was really using his training to send messages in Morse code.</p><p style="text-align:left;">No wonder he was so insistent on doing it that way.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ryan&#x27;s face went white as a sheet, and his body trembled slightly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But he still refused to admit it, gritting his teeth as he said, &quot;This is nonsense! I don&#x27;t even know Morse code, let alone send messages. You&#x27;re making this up!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He glared at Osborne and continued, &quot;I know what you&#x27;re thinking. You probably see me as the one among the younger generation of the Augustine family who is closest to your strength and who works the hardest in cultivation. You must be worried that I&#x27;ll surpass you and compete with you for the position of heir, right?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So you want to slander me and take me down, because you&#x27;re afraid I&#x27;ll be your competition for the inheritance!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ryan shouted, hoping someone would believe him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But no one said a word.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne smiled faintly, &quot;You still trying to fight back, Ryan? Admit it. The moment I decided to expose you, it was game over.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ryan was furious, shouting hysterically, &quot;Osborne, shut up! How dare you call me a traitor to the Augustines? I grew up in this family. My loyalty runs bone deep. You&#x27;re just a newcomer. You have no idea how much this family means to me. What gives you the right to question me?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Why would I betray the Augustines? Why would I sell them out? What could I possibly gain from that?!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Why would you betray the Augustines? Good question. I didn&#x27;t want to say anything, but you asked for it, so here it comes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You betrayed the Augustines because deep down, you already knew the truth. You&#x27;re not an Augustine! You don&#x27;t have a single drop of Augustine blood in your veins! You&#x27;ve known for a long time you&#x27;re not Isaac&#x27;s real grandson!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As Osborne finished speaking, everyone was stunned.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Their jaw dropped as they looked at Ryan and then at Isaac.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isaac, at that moment, closed his eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His body trembled slightly, and tears streamed down his cheeks.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His reaction shocked everyone even more.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Isaac, is it true that Ryan isn&#x27;t really your biological grandson? How could that be possible?&quot; someone couldn&#x27;t hold back and asked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isaac sighed deeply. &quot;Osborne is right. Ryan... He isn&#x27;t my biological grandson. Or rather, Ryan&#x27;s father isn&#x27;t my biological son. I found him and took him in.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After Isaac finished speaking, everyone was stunned once again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne continued, &quot;Ryan, the reason you betrayed the Augustines is that you hate them! You believe your father was the most outstanding member of the last generation, but Isaac didn&#x27;t pass on the position of heir to him. Instead, he gave it to Yulissa&#x27;s father, Allen.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He sneered, &quot;From that moment on, you&#x27;ve been dissatisfied.&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
