  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a warmly decorated and spacious room, Osborne sees his so-called younger sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a very beautiful girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne, who was used to seeing beautiful women, was a little dazed at the first sight. Only Clarissa and Isa could compare with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a tall and slender figure, likely close to six feet tall. At that moment, she was punching a sandbag in the room. She didn't look injured at all. Fine beads of sweat covered her wheat-colored skin, dampening her long, flowing hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing someone push open the door, she stopped her hand movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Queenie and nodded slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she stared at Osborne for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're my brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally spoke. Her voice was pleasant, but her expression was scrutinizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yulissa, of course he is your brother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Wise Order has confirmed it, and he is now the heir of the Augustine family. He defeated me, Nathan, Ryan, and Kaden alone, gaining everyone's recognition," Queenie hurriedly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Yulissa's eyes lit up. She stared intently at Osborne, and her eyes seemingly gleamed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit awkward under her gaze and rubbed his nose. "Yulissa, if everything goes as expected, I should be your brother. However, when I was separated from our father, you hadn't been born yet, so you wouldn't know me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa couldn't help but chuckle when she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look at Queenie and said, "Queen, thank you for coming to see me. My injuries are completely healed now, and there is no problem at all. I would like to have a private conversation with my brother, is that alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie was stunned for a moment, then nodded. "It's good that you're healed! But remember, from now on, you mustn't act impulsively and avoid going out to sea easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two, brother and sister, have a good chat. I'll leave first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Queenie left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne and Yulissa remained in the room. Yulissa did not rush to speak. She walked to the door and glanced left and right outside to make sure no one was eavesdropping before she closed and locked the door securely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne saw her lock the door, he raised his eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is she up to? Her expression doesn't seem like how one would react upon seeing one's own brother. There's something slightly weird about it," Osborne thought, but he was not worried at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Yulissa was only eighteen years old. Even if she was exceptionally talented, how much strength could she possibly possess?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really my brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa finally spoke again. This time, she approached Osborne closely, her tall figure only a few inches shorter than his, allowing them to look directly at each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded without hesitation and said, "Yes, I am your real brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lying!" Yulissa snorted coldly and continued. "You don't need to pretend anymore. I know you're not my real brother! Even if everyone in The Wise Order tells me that you are, I still know you are not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth in slight surprise and asked, "Why are you so sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I know my real brother died over twenty years ago! If I'm not mistaken, you must have made some kind of deal with The Wise Order for them to let you impersonate my brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly are you up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa leaned in very close to Osborne, so close that he could almost feel her breath and catch a hint of her natural fragrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one in the entire Augustine family doubted his identity, as all the members of The Wise Order endorsed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ironically, this eighteen-year-old girl was incredibly confident that he was not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her reasons left Osborne speechless and unable to refute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that he could no longer hide the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> Osborne nodded and said, "Alright, you're right. I am indeed not your real brother. But as for what I want to do, you shouldn't ask me. Instead, you should go and ask the members of The Wise Order."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Wise Order? Hmph, they won't tell me the truth. They only see me as a child! My father died, died at sea, at the hands of pirates. Not only did they not help avenge my father, but they also didn't allow me to seek revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's expression became agitated as she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip and stared at Osborne. "Your name is Osborne, right? I don't care what kind of deal you have made with The Wise Order or what your true intentions are for impersonating the heir of the Augustine family. I just hope that you can agree to one condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you promise me, I can assure you that during your time in the family, I will pretend not to know that you're a fake. I will not reveal your identity to anyone, and I will even play the role of your sister obediently, ensuring that nobody suspects you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned again when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment and frowned. "What condition do you want me to agree to? Tell me first. If it's something simple, I can consider it. But if it's too difficult, then forget it. If you want to expose me, go ahead. I can just leave your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa looked at Osborne's indifferent expression and suddenly became anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she still said, "I want you to avenge my father!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
