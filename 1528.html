  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's recovery was even faster than Osborne had imagined. For someone else, such severe injuries would have taken months to heal, but within less than twenty breaths, her Divine Body was fully restored, her energy growing stronger with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, I'm all better now. You can let me go," she said softly, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time in her life she had ever been held in the arms of a man, and to make matters more complicated, Osborne was dodging attacks from two Deity Overlord-level Deathborns while doing so. The constant twists and turns made their bodies brush against each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her recovery, Hannah became acutely aware of Osborne's solid, muscular chest and the potent aura of masculinity radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart raced wildly, like a little deer caught in headlights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, was too focused on their dire situation to notice the change in Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure of being pursued by two Deity Overlord-level Deathborns was far greater than anything he had experienced fighting Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even pushing Thunderform Flash to its limits, he couldn't create enough distance between them. Each dodge was a narrow escape; one misstep could lead to injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that kind of pressure weighing on him, he had no time to dwell on anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But upon hearing Hannah say she was ready to fight, he felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!" he exclaimed, quickly shifting his stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed Thunderform Flash again, managing to create a bit of space before gently setting Hannah down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Hannah was free from his grasp, an unexpected pang of disappointment hit her, but it was quickly overshadowed by the urgency of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Deity Overlord Deathborns were charging at them once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two damned Deathborns almost killed me just now! But now, you won't get the chance! Lachlan, let's take them on&mdash;one each. Let's see who can take them down first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed, feeling the thrill of the challenge. "Sounds good! Let's do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he selected one of the Deathborns and charged in, while Hannah did the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them faced off against their own Deity Overlord-level foe, and Osborne felt a surge of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Deity Overlord-ranked Deathborn were a formidable bunch, he was no pushover himself. With his Level Six lightning elemental essence, he might struggle against other Deity Overlord warriors, but when facing off against these Deathborn elites, he was more than capable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why? Because Thunder Power had a natural advantage against Deathborn, and he was ready to exploit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Osborne and Hannah were extraordinary talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they hadn't yet reached the Deity Overlord level themselves&mdash;Osborne still being at the peak of Superior Deity&mdash;they unleashed power that rivaled that of the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one-on-one combat, they quickly began to dominate their opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Deathborns, even at the Deity Overlord level, lack intelligence. Unless they have a significant strength advantage, they're not too hard to deal with," Osborne thought as he unleashed a torrent of Judgment Thunder Drakes, shattering the Deathborn's defenses and inflicting heavy damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his speed was adequate, but Hannah was even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than twenty exchanges, the Deathborn she faced was obliterated by her overwhelming attacks, falling lifeless to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few moments later, Osborne followed suit, using a barrage of massive Judgment Thunder Drakes to finish off his own Deity Overlord-level Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Hannah had already found the time to eliminate all the Celestial Deity-level Deathborns surrounding them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle within the main mine suddenly came to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated Satan's Eye, scanning the depths of the main mine for any remaining traces of the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that it? Have we really taken care of everything?" he murmured, unable to suppress his admiration for Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm still a bit weaker than Hannah at this point. If I want to surpass her, I'll need to break through from the peak of Superior Deity to the Transcendent Deity level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, excitement surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-grade death scent left behind by the two defeated Deity Overlord-level Deathborns was incredibly pure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a treasure trove, and now, all of it was set to become the restorative power for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity greedily absorbed the pure high-grade death scent, and Osborne could feel its leaves unfurling, fully rejuvenating with life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had regained about ninety percent of its vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the final flower remained, its petals still wilted and tightly closed, yet to bloom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was filled with anticipation. He could hardly wait for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to fully restore itself in the next instant!</span></p><div class="pagination">
