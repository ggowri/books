  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've done better than I expected, Osborne," Godfather spoke directly this time, with a faint smile playing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't explain it, but Godfather's praise filled him with a sudden thrill, like a rush of strength flowing into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a solemn tone, he replied, "You flatter me. I've just started and still have a long way to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather nodded and said with a smile, "Very good. It's important to remain humble. You've achieved some success, but it's still far from enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked in confusion, "Why did you call for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing really. I just wanted to chat." Godfather rose from the sofa, gripping his black and gold cane, and approached the camera, observing Osborne intently. "You look more mature now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't respond. He didn't believe Godfather had called him just for a casual chat. Thus, he waited for Godfather to state his purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather continued, "Looks like you can't wait to hear about the next test, rather than having a chat with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather shook his head lightly as he spoke. Osborne wasn't sure if he imagined it, but he seemed to detect a trace of regret and sorrow in Godfather's look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne parted his lips but ultimately didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His feelings toward Godfather were complex. He felt both resentment and gratitude. He resented his biological grandfather for making him an orphan who had wandered for over 20 years before finding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also resented that despite their reunion, Godfather hadn't even bothered to meet him in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, he was grateful because Godfather's appearance had indeed changed his life. The three successor tests had transformed him into a different person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had turned Osborne from an insecure lower-class member of society, a disdained member of his wife's wealthy family, into the confident man he was today, discovering his potential and becoming brave and fearless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These transformations occurred only after Godfather came into his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had no genuine affection for Godfather. Their relationship could never be like that of an ordinary grandfather and grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Godfather's eyes, Osborne had not yet completed all the tests and was not a qualified successor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similarly, for Osborne, Godfather wasn't a fitting grandfather either. The rewards Godfather offered were plentiful, but they lacked any sense of familial love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne thought of that, he calmly asked, "What is my fourth test?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather shook his head and sighed, "Patience, Osborne. Before I tell you about the fourth test, I need to make something clear. You performed exceptionally well in the first three tests, surpassing my expectations. However, those were just beginner tasks. They were neither very difficult nor dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and wondered, "Not very difficult nor dangerous?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does he not know how many dangerous situations I have gone through to complete the Godfather's successor test?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What about the gunfights?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassinations?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolves that I have encountered?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the battles with metahumans, no less!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dangers I faced in this period were more than what I had experienced in my entire previous life. Yet in the Godfather's eyes, these tests weren't difficult or dangerous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather smiled faintly, "Do you think I'm wrong? Osborne, I'm not lying to you. The first three trials were indeed not very difficult or dangerous because, from the fourth trial onward, the difficulty and danger will increase rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The first three tests were within my control, but from the fourth test on, things will be out of my hands. I don't know what will happen, and neither does anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will begin to see the truth of this world, witnessing its truly cruel, dangerous side, and disgusting side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You could die at any moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow and responded calmly, "I'm not afraid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather smiled wryly, "To be honest, after seeing how well you've done, I don't want you to die. So, I'm giving you a second chance to choose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would you choose to take your riches and find a safe place to live out a life of luxury?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the Godfather could finish speaking, Osborne loudly refused. "No, I won't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grim as he continued, "Stop trying to convince me to give up. I won't. I will complete all your tests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, tell me about the fourth test. No matter how dangerous or difficult, I will keep moving forward and never retreat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that, the Godfather looked at Osborne's serious and determined face and suddenly fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, the Godfather continued, "You are so much like your father. Do you know that he also went through my successor tests years ago? I tried to convince him to quit, but he wouldn't...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it was during these tests that he went missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, your parents did not abandon you. They encountered an accident, and that accident was caused by my successor tests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want you to follow in your father's footsteps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the Godfather finished speaking, Osborne was stunned and asked, "What... what did you say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My parents didn't abandon me? They had an accident during your tests and went missing?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
