  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Maw Arrow, formed by merging with Dimensional Maw, is the most powerful attack technique Osborne currently possesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Osborne wouldn&rsquo;t use this technique because his opponents are usually defeated before he even has the chance to unleash the Maw Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Horace couldn&rsquo;t force Osborne to unleash the Maw Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When fighting Agatha, Osborne considered using the Maw Arrow, but she didn&rsquo;t give him the chance. She kept closing the distance between them with her Dark Phoenix Wings, leaving him no opportunity to use it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, the Warfare Shield has successfully forced Osborne to unleash the Maw Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Maw Arrow consists of only one arrow. Due to the black holes&rsquo; mutual devouring effect, no matter how hard Osborne tries, he cannot form two non-interfering Maw Arrows on the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, for now, he can&rsquo;t do it. But Osborne feels that one Maw Arrow is enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked extremely serious, thinking, "I don&rsquo;t believe you can withstand even the Maw Arrow. If you come out completely unscathed, I&rsquo;ll admit defeat and acknowledge my lack of ability."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, he released the bowstring. The arrow, seemingly transformed into a black hole, shot out instantly and reached the Warfare Shield in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying devouring force erupted, wildly tearing at the Warfare Mist. At this moment, the Warfare Shield seemed to feel the pressure too, shaking violently. The Warfare Mist grew denser, desperately resisting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, with a loud boom, the Maw Arrow exploded. The terrifying force created dense dimensional rifts around it. However, the Warfare Mist released by the Warfare Shield still didn&rsquo;t completely collapse, only leaving a gap from the explosion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Even the Maw Arrow can't break it?" Osborne was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already used his strongest attack move, yet he still couldn't completely break through the Warfare Mist. The defensive strength of the Warfare Shield left Osborne shocked again and again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's truly a great thing." Osborne was very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Maw Arrow didn&rsquo;t completely break through the Warfare Mist, it created a gap. Even though the gap quickly closed, Osborne had already seen hope for victory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One Maw Arrow can only create a gap. What about ten? A hundred? As long as I can make a gap, I can completely break your defense." Thinking this, Osborne quickly took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another Maw Arrow quickly formed on the Bloodwrought Bow and shot out. Before this Maw Arrow even struck the Warfare Mist, the next one had already formed on the Bloodwrought Bow and continued to shoot out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne fired a continuous stream of Maw Arrows, each creating a gap in the Warfare Mist. Before the gap could close, the second Maw Arrow arrived, striking the same spot and making the gap even larger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was like an emotionless archery machine, shooting arrows faster and faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maw Arrow consumes a lot of energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, to unleash maximum power, Osborne didn&rsquo;t hold back his Sacred Power and went all out. Under normal circumstances, just two or three Maw Arrows like this would deplete most of the Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne possesses the Chaotic Spiritual Root.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Chaotic Spiritual Root was rooted in the void, drawing power from it to restore Osborne's Sacred Power. This allowed Osborne to have no worries about running out of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne kept shooting Maw Arrows and quickly fired more than twenty. Although the Chaotic Spiritual Root could restore Osborne's Sacred Power, he still felt some soreness in his arm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation was already quite good because his body had reached the mid Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else at the same cultivation level as him, they would likely run out of strength after fully drawing the Bloodwrought Bow four or five times at most, possibly even unable to lift their arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the most powerful aspect of the Chaotic Spiritual Root is that it can even restore soul power and physical strength. At this moment, Osborne felt power flowing into his arms. Then, the soreness in his arms instantly disappeared, and they were filled with strength again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the gap on the Warfare Mist had grown much larger. But the Warfare Shield did not give up and kept shooting arrows frantically. Amid constant vibrations, the Warfare Shield released more Warfare Mist in an attempt to patch up the gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Osborne stopped shooting arrows, the gap would immediately disappear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Let's see who gives up first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth and continued firing Maw Arrows, relentlessly attacking the Warfare Shield. The chance to challenge only comes once. If he gave up now, all his previous efforts would be in vain, and he would lose the opportunity to obtain the four Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that were the outcome, Osborne would be very unwilling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially after the Warfare Shield displayed such terrifying defensive power, Osborne was even less likely to give it up. No matter what, he had to obtain the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Broke!" Osborne shouted loudly, firing arrows nonstop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By now, he had already fired over a hundred Maw Arrows in succession. Even a warrior who had just advanced to Empyrean Sacredness would be torn to shreds by so many </span><span>Maw</span><span> Arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Warfare Shield was still holding on, even though the gap in the Warfare Mist had grown significantly. Osborne could already see the appearance of the Warfare Shield through the gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The green glow on the Warfare Shield seemed much dimmer than before, and the Warfare Ancient Tree engraved on it appeared somewhat blurred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew the power of the Warfare Shield was nearing its limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne very happy. He thought, "In a war of attrition, no one can beat me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne kept firing Maw Arrows. During this process, Osborne felt his control over the Maw Arrows had significantly improved. His speed in unleashing Maw Arrows was also much faster than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "My archery skills have improved."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, the Warfare Shield finally couldn't hold up anymore. After all, it was suppressed to the level of a low-grade Sacred Artifact. The fact that it lasted this long was enough to prove its terrifying power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gaps in the Warfare Mist grew larger, and the Warfare Mist was almost gone. At this point, the Warfare Shield could no longer hold on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as Osborne thought victory was near, the Warfare Shield started to move. The Warfare Mist was suddenly absorbed back into it. Then, the phantom of a Warfare Ancient Tree suddenly appeared in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, with a loud boom, the phantom of the Warfare Ancient Tree exploded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne never expected that the Warfare Shield not only had terrifying defense but also offensive capabilities. The power of the Warfare Ancient Tree's phantom explosion made Osborne frown deeply. Its force was even stronger than his Maw Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's already weak defense couldn't withstand such an explosion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to be engulfed by the explosion, it suddenly vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Maw Arrow Osborne shot hit the Warfare Shield first, cracking it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crack indicated that the Warfare Shield had failed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Osborne passed the Warfare Ancient Tree's test, the Warfare Shield's final counterattack naturally disappeared.</span></p><div class="pagination">
