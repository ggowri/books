  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One moment, Osborne was contemplating how killing some Celestial Deity-level Deathborn would accelerate the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very next moment, those Deathborn appeared in overwhelming numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him, there were at least fifty or sixty Celestial Deity-level Deathborns, accompanied by over a hundred Transcendent Deity-level ones, charging toward them with terrifying ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a shiver run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were Transcendent Deity-level Deathborns. While they might not match the strength of practitioners from the other races at the same level, they were undeniably formidable and utterly fearless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Osborne had only just broken through to Celestial Deity himself, and many of these Deathborn were likely at a higher level than he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention, his true strength was just that of a Superior Deity at its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a typical Deity Overlord would think twice before confronting a horde of Celestial Deity-level Deathborn. A direct clash could spell disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression grew serious, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lacking Saturn's Eye, she couldn't see the situation in the depths of the main mine like Osborne could. However, thanks to her mastery of life power, she possessed an acute sensitivity to various forms of vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborns were, after all, a form of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could clearly sense an overwhelming surge of vitality closing in on them from deeper within the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Osborne, she awaited his command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have confidence against nearly sixty Celestial Deity-level Deathborns?" Osborne asked, gauging her resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression was grave. "Sixty? That's a tall order! However, if we work together, we might stand a chance! Worst case, we can always burst through and escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded appreciatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm glad you're not afraid! Let's do this! If we want to clear this mining area of Deathborn, we have to face these Celestial Deity-level ones head-on. Get ready for battle! Stay sharp and don't let them surround us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined nod, Hannah prepared herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, almost sixty Celestial Deity-level Deathborns came into view, their menacing and twisted forms charging at the two of them, a palpable aura of murderous intent enveloping the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce shout, Osborne took the initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Judgment Thunder Drake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder boomed as the massive lightning dragon surged forth, crashing into the lead Celestial Deity-level Deathborn with shocking force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The illumination of pulsing lightning lit up the scene as the Deathborn's body disintegrated under the onslaught, but Osborne felt the energy of his lightning dragon deplete entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was taken aback. "The defenses on these Celestial Deity-level Deathborn are incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thank the heavens, my Thunder elemental essence broke through to Level Six; otherwise, it would've been a real problem to take down just one of them with a single strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitating, he unleashed another lightning dragon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His elemental essence fused seamlessly with his Divine Body, allowing him to unleash his powers far more quickly than other practitioners. By the time Osborne released a third dragon and took down his third Celestial Deity-level opponent, only then did Hannah finally unleash her first attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive black arrow shot forth, piercing through one Celestial Deity-level Deathborn, its momentum barely slowing as it continued to impale a second one before it finally lost power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah had just taken down two Celestial Deity-level Deathborns with a single shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, "Wow, she's really something! Even with my Thunder elemental essence hitting Level Six, I still can't compare to her strength! Unless I break through from Superior Deity to Transcendent Deity, I doubt my attack power can match hers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did he know, Hannah was just as stunned, if not more so, by the turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Hannah had just taken down two Celestial Deity-level Deathborns with a single shot, by the time she unleashed her attack, Osborne had already summoned three lightning dragons, slaying three of those formidable foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His killing speed had surpassed hers, leaving Hannah both astonished and a bit frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, her competitive spirit flaring, "How can he have such a rapid attack speed? His level is lower than mine, and his attack power doesn't match up, yet he's outpacing me. I need to step it up; I won't let him outshine me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Hannah quickened her attack frequency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Osborne's voice cut through her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on! Don't rush it! If you keep pushing like this, your divine power will drain quickly, and you'll become a liability for me! Find your rhythm; attack while you recover!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah paused, feeling a flush creep to her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" she replied softly, taking a moment to regain her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on with ferocity. Nearly sixty Celestial Deity-level Deathborns, along with over a hundred Transcendent Deity-level ones, were relentless in their assault, forcing both of them to stay on their toes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, their combined strength was formidable enough to keep them ahead of the curve. After weathering the initial chaos, they found their footing as the number of Celestial Deity-level Deathborns began to dwindle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the fight, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity continued to absorb vast amounts of high-grade death scent, its leaves unfurling gracefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only the petals remained to fully recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced with excitement as he anticipated the Lotus' complete revival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was caught up in that hopeful thought, an unexpected turn of events unfolded.</span></p><div class="pagination">
