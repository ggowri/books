  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked a bit taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seems like Gustave and Malcolm know each other, and they're like oil and water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't dwell on it for long. Gustave had stepped up for him, and there was no way he'd just stand by and let Gustave get dissed by Malcolm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne strode forward, squared up to Malcolm, and said in a cool, steely tone, "Malcolm, right? I've got no clue why you're so hell-bent on provoking me, but I've gotta say, you've really gotten my goat! You claimed I thought you weren't good enough to invite me to team up, and that I'd teach you a lesson in the state duel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine then! I didn't say those things before, but now, I'm making it a promise! You sorry bunch of losers aren't even in the same league as me. You're not fit to ask me to join your team. And if you cross my path in the state duel, I'll beat you black and blue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't believe me, just sit tight and watch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne looked down his nose at Malcolm, pure disdain in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm was left gobsmacked. He never saw this coming, never expected Osborne to talk to him like that, to be so ballsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his face turned as dark as a storm cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers, upon hearing Osborne's words, couldn't help but let out gasps of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on?" someone blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne actually had the balls to talk to Malcolm like that? Malcolm's a top-100 powerhouse! He's ranked 80th on the strength leaderboard, twenty-three spots ahead of Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the real issue ain't Malcolm. It's Conrad! Malcolm's part of Conrad's team, and Conrad's ranked 15th. Will he just sit back and let his teammate get dissed by Osborne like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Conrad's face turned as cold as ice when he heard what Osborne had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his steely gaze on Osborne and said, "Osborne, you're way too full of yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sneering laugh. "Me? Arrogant? Aren't you guys the ones who are full of it? I was just chilling in my lodgings with a sign saying I was already on a team and wasn't looking to join another. But you guys barged in, bugging me to join your team, and the offer you threw at me was just thirty thousand Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You acted like you were doing me a huge favor just by inviting me. I turned you down, and then you thought I was being disrespectful, that I was the arrogant one?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if that's how you see it, then I'll show you what real arrogance looks like! Who the hell do you think you are, Conrad? Why are you strutting around like a big shot? If you've got the guts, let's settle this in the state duel. Name the spot, and if you don't show up, you're a spineless coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished his tirade, the crowd went wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Clara and Gustave were gawking at Osborne like he'd grown a second head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne's actually challenging Conrad? Are you kidding me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's ranked 108th, and Conrad's sitting pretty at 15th. There's a huge gulf in their strength, and Conrad's got at least four top-100 teammates backing him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell has gotten into Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's like he's just asking for a one-way ticket to the grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, in the state duel, killing's off-limits, and there are Empyrean Sacredness referees lurking in the shadows, ready to jump in and save anyone who gets their ass kicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But battles are unpredictable; shit happens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In past state duels, plenty of contestants have bitten the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's poking the bear like this. Isn't he worried Conrad'll take his head off? With Conrad's whole crew in the mix, if they decide to finish Osborne off, the refs might not even have a chance to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, good, good!" Conrad thundered, his voice booming with barely-contained rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Osborne was nothing but a pesky mosquito buzzing around a grizzly bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did a grizzly back down from a mosquito? Hell no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne with a look that could kill, his eyes narrowed to slits, and hissed, "You said it yourself, pal! Since you're so eager to meet your maker, I'll be more than happy to oblige. Once we hit the state duel combat zone, we'll pick a spot. And if you don't show up, you're a yellow-bellied coward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll let you breathe for a couple more days! Make the most of your last few moments in this world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Conrad upped his pace and hightailed it out of there with Malcolm and the rest of his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before taking off, Malcolm shot Osborne another menacing throat-slitting gesture that sent shivers down the spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort, his eyes blazing with a fierce, homicidal glint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Conrad and his gang had vanished from sight, the crowd that had been gathered around, realizing there was no more action to gawk at, gave Osborne a long, hard look. Then they started shuffling away, muttering to themselves as they went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Osborne is as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's only ranked 108th, and he's got the nerve to rile up Conrad! Conrad's not just a badass on his own, but he's also got four top-100 teammates in his corner! Even those top-notch geniuses ranked in the top ten wouldn't be stupid enough to mess with Conrad's crew. They'd probably steer clear of them like the plague! But Osborne just marched right up and provoked him, even threw down the gauntlet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's got a death wish, plain and simple!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, he's probably gone off the deep end! I mean, he was the big shot, the champion of Tempest Fortress City. But then he comes to the state duel and finds out there are over a hundred folks who can out-muscle him. He couldn't even crack the top 100 on the strength leaderboard. Anybody'd be seething mad in his shoes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyhow, he's a goner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's hushed chatter reached Osborne's ears, but he just tuned them out like they were white noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara and Gustave eyed him with a mix of worry and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave furrowed his brow. "Osborne, you're really gonna go through with this duel against Conrad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a faint smile. "They're pushing me around. Am I supposed to tuck my tail and run? I don't go looking for fights, but I sure as hell ain't scared of them! Since I said yes to this duel, I'm in it all the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave's worry deepened. "But Conrad's no pushover! He's ranked 15th for a reason. He's got two Sacred Artifacts down pat! One's for offense and the other's for defense. With those two toys in his arsenal, he can even hold his own against those super-geniuses in the top ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even his four teammates are all in the top 100! Malcolm's sitting at 80th place, and the other three are even tougher nuts to crack, ranked anywhere between 50th and 80th. Put them all together, and they're hands-down one of the powerhouses in the state duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave fixed his gaze on Osborne, hoping he'd see reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, pride's a big deal, but sometimes, staying alive takes the cake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "I get it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave let out a sigh of relief, thinking Osborne had thrown in the towel on the duel with Conrad and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyways, I ain't too fond of that Malcolm either! If you cross paths with them in the state duel... just holler at me! I might not be able to go toe-to-toe with them, but I can still chip in a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. "Appreciate it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the group reached the East Gate of the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex. A few hundred brawny warriors taking part in the state duel were already there, cooling their heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne and his mates showed up, a bunch of folks craned their necks to take a look and started whispering among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apparently, the news about Osborne's duel with Conrad had spread like wildfire. Almost everyone cast surprised and disdainful looks at Osborne, thinking he was just asking for trouble and digging his own grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't care less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started to sweep his eyes across the crowd, on the lookout for potential threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a stir in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Benson's here! That's Benson, ranked fourth on the state duel strength leaderboard! He hails from a First-rate Power. He's a super genius who's managed to fuse three types of power..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
