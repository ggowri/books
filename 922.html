  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, panic washed over Bradley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power was overwhelming, far beyond anything he could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of such might, he felt utterly powerless. Even when they combined their strengths, it was clear they stood no chance against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Scarlett and Marlon's attacks finally landed, forcing Osborne to defend himself, which gave Bradley the chance to retreat to a safe distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes remained wide with fear as he spoke quickly, "This isn't working! With our combined strength, we can't break through his Light Realm! We need a different plan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What plan?" Scarlett asked, urgency lacing her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Self-destruct our Realms!" Bradley gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett and Marlon exchanged alarmed glances; their expressions hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The concept of self-destructing their Realms was terrifying; it would inflict severe mental backlash, leaving them vulnerable and injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne attacked during that moment of weakness, they would be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry! I've got backup outside! With them here, they can hold Osborne off long enough for us to recover. By then, it'll be Osborne's turn to face the end!" Bradley said, confidence radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Backup?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett and Marlon shared a knowing look and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Let's do it! We don't have any other choice! Osborne's Light Realm is too powerful. If we can't shatter it, we won't stand a chance! If we all self-destruct our Realms together, the resulting power will definitely break through his Light Realm! Once that happens, we'll be at an advantage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their decision made, the three sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, their realms began to tremble violently, a terrible force brewing within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened as he realized what they were planning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no choice but to envelop himself in a protective martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, their Realms exploded simultaneously. Although their realms were only Level Three and not as strong as Osborne's, the sheer force of the explosion was staggering. The shockwaves shattered everything around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Light Realm couldn't withstand such a self-destruct; it began to crumble under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grunted, blood seeping from the corner of his mouth as he suffered from the mental backlash, sustaining some injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the backlash hit Marlon, Scarlett, and Bradley even harder. They had initiated the self-destruction, and all three of them were violently coughing up blood, their faces pale and exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeking death, are we?" Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he vanished from sight, only to reappear right in front of them, his fist swinging down with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Block him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces turned ashen as they pushed through their pain, unleashing their remaining strength to fend off Osborne's attack. Yet, it was futile; he sent them flying with a single punch, causing them to spew even more blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold laughter echoed as he saw the vulnerabilities in their defense. He prepared to finish them off once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, an unexpected twist unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying invisible force descended upon Osborne, immobilizing him. Layers of stone-like skin began to sprout and spread across his body, even his martial art aura struggling to hold it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Petrification power? What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to see two figures standing behind him, identical in appearance, like twin sisters. Their eyes shone brightly, radiating a light that enveloped Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped, disbelief etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Medusas stood before Osborne, radiating an overwhelming presence. Their petrification power was so potent that even now, Osborne found himself affected, a feat unfathomable given his current strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't just any Medusas&mdash;there was no doubt in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed the unmistakable aura of Class S emanating from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class S Medusa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened, a grave look overcoming him. He unleashed his martial art aura, struggling to fend off the encroaching petrification, fighting to keep his body from turning to stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley's mocking laughter cut through the tension. "Ha! Osborne, looks like your luck just ran out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These aren't ordinary Medusas; they're Medusa Queens! They may not be fully-fledged, but they've got most of the Class S power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's unease deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Gerardo has successfully cloned Class S Medusa Queens?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure he felt intensified, weighing heavily on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley snorted, suppressing further details as a menacing glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared, "Let's take him down together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Osborne's Light Realm shattered and two Class S Medusa Queens backing us up, he's as good as finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's finish this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Bradley, Scarlett, and Marlon charged forward, joining forces with the two Medusa Queens to launch a relentless assault on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they closed in, Osborne could feel the enormous pressure mounting around him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
