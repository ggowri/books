  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Six losses in a row!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's fists tightened, his frustration evident. His once-proud demeanor was now overshadowed by a sense of defeat, like a wilted flower after a storm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had arrived in Tethynia with sky-high confidence, believing himself to be one of the elite of his generation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He envisioned breaking onto the Godson Rankings and even defeating Cuthbert at the Honor Quest Ceremony to claim the Williamson family's ancient artifacts and a massive fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, after six matches, he hadn't won a single one. Each opponent had easily outmatched him, and the reality of his situation was crushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To make matters worse, these were not even the top-tier competitors but just average players who had effortlessly defeated him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look at you, kid. Maybe you should head back and train for a few more years. With your skills, you're just making a fool of yourself out here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Being a top talent doesn't mean anything here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're losing so badly. You might as well stay off the stage and stop wasting everyone's time. You're weak, and your combat experience is laughable. More than half of the people here could wipe the floor with you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just go back and keep hidden away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The jeers echoed around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's anger flared as he turned to face the source of the taunts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Roger, the guy who had just knocked him off the stage. The emblem on Roger's chest revealed he was from Tethynia and part of a local organization known as the Eityreia Organization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the stage, Roger had dispatched Stuart with just three moves, leaving him shaky and defenseless, with a knife pressed against his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's face flushed with a mix of rage and humiliation as he glared at Roger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Still not happy, huh?" Roger sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With your sorry excuse for skills, you should be grateful you're even allowed to watch. I'm giving you a friendly piece of advice. If you can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's insults grew more scathing. Stuart's anger was palpable, and even Vivian's face showed signs of irritation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne and Emma exchanged worried glances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's taunts seemed deliberately aimed at provoking Stuart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eityreia Organization?" Osborne mused, suddenly recalling that the Eityreia Organization was reputed to be the world's top assassin organization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mind flashed back to when his parents went missing in Skyefall. Three Supreme Overlords at Class S were in the area at the time and were suspects in the disappearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One was the King of the Aberrants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another was League of Divine Descent's deputy leader, Reginald Hastings, and the third was the top assassin from the Eityreia Organization, Emperor Dare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne watched the scene unfold with a steely gaze, his mind racing. "So, Roger's from the Eityreia Organization? Why would they send someone like him to a public event? Isn't he worried about blowing his cover?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is he just arrogant, or do Eityreia Organization assassins always act this way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression hardened as he thought about his missing parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those three potential kidnappers were still on his radar, and he wouldn't rest until he investigated each one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emperor Dare could very well become his future adversary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a strong possibility that he might end up facing off against Eityreia Organization in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's gaze fixed on Roger, his eyes cold and determined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Roger dismissed Stuart with contempt. "You're still here? Get lost already!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd around them watched with a mix of amusement and pity. Nobody seemed inclined to stand up for Stuart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why hasn't he left yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Roger's from the Eityreia Organization. He's climbed into the top 200 assassins on their list. That's impressive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eityreia Organization's power rivals any major force. If Roger's targeting him, this kid's in deep trouble. Offending Roger is like offending the entire Eityreia Organization. He'd better watch his back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he's smart, he'll swallow his pride and get out of here before things get worse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The whispers only fueled Stuart's anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face flushed red as he spat out, "Roger, you're the real trash here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you so cocky about? I wasn't even trying my best just now. I underestimated your tricks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll fight you again. Are you up for it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's fists were clenched, his determination to restore his pride burning fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivian's face turned pale as she rushed to his side, urgently advising, "Stuart, don't be a fool!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Stuart ignored her and charged back onto the stage, his resolve unwavering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to take you down this time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's expression remained calm, a chilling smile spreading across his face as he prepared for the next bout.</p><div class="pagination">
