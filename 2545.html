  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything on Celestara Planet was naturally fine. After all, Osborne had only been away for a little over half a year. Before he left, he had already eliminated all threats here and left behind a hundred of his Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Empire of the Sun he established was also the strongest force here, and no one dared to challenge it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne returned to the Sanctum of Sun with his parents and Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't contact Sebastian, Jethro, or the others in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to give them a surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What followed was naturally a warm family reunion. Sebastian held Theodore and wept, while Jethro and Osborne's dozen uncles also held Vivienne and cried. They were all incredibly emotional.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne showed a bright smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, he did it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To find his parents, he tracked from Blue Planet to Celestara Planet, then to Necoton Planet, Racial Convergence Planet, Stellar Region M72, and Inferno Planet...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Osborne found Vivienne and Theodore and brought them back safely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this time, he encountered countless difficulties and dangers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, he felt it was all worth it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is wonderful!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is wonderful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha also nodded. Watching Osborne reunite with his family, she couldn't help but cry because she no longer had a family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To protect her, the members of the Ember Phoenix Clan, including her only relative, her grandfather, were all killed by those black-masked warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha had no idea who her parents were. Even her grandfather wasn't her biological grandfather, just the person who adopted her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she also wanted to find her parents. Unfortunately, she had no clues at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, I'm going to train!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Cast Time Acceleration for me! I want to improve my strength quickly and avenge the elders of the Ember Phoenix Clan and my grandfather!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne arranged a place for Agatha to stay. In her residence, he directly cast a hundredfold Time Acceleration to help her speed up time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, she obtained numerous Dragon Elixirs and branches of the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore. She needed time to digest and absorb them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also needed time to master those Legendary Sacred Artifact warships and Superior Sacred Artifact warships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After some time, Agatha's strength will become even greater.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she is a Dark Phoenix, the most powerful branch of the Ember Phoenix Clan. With the branches of the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore, her Dark Phoenix Bloodline will become even purer and stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time she finishes her training, her strength might have already surpassed Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the following period, Osborne didn&rsquo;t train but spent time with Vivienne, Theodore, Sebastian, Jethro, and others. To have more time with them, he even applied hundreds of times Time Acceleration to the entire Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like that, he spent ten years there with Vivienne and Theodore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne healed the scars on Vivienne's face. She has regained her youthful appearance and become as beautiful as Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That day, she came to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you've been with us for ten years. That's enough! Now, you should go and do your own thing! Don't forget, you still have revenge to take! As your parents, we wish we could keep you by our side forever, but we know that's impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, your father can stay with me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, you don't need to stay with us anymore. Go and train! Only by becoming stronger can you better avenge your other mother!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She&rsquo;s still waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne bit his lip and nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, I understand!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne finally began his training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chose to train with 100x Time Acceleration. It wasn&rsquo;t because he couldn&rsquo;t go faster, but because this level of Time Acceleration had the best effect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were any faster, problems would arise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's four months until the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! I must return to the Racial Convergence Planet half a month early, so I have three and a half months left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In 100x Time Acceleration, three and a half months turn into 28 years!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"During this time, I hope my strength can improve!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne took out the Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had used Elven Sacred Water before, so the Top-grade Dragon Elixir no longer had any effect on him. Only the Legendary Dragon Elixir could help him enter the Enlightenment State again, comprehend the world, and enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and swallowed the Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, he felt as if he had transformed into a soul, drifting through the cosmos, watching stars being born and destroyed, and witnessing various unique creatures from birth to death...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During this process, Osborne's understanding of the cosmos improved once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And all his elemental essences were rapidly improving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time passed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't spend all his time absorbing the Legendary Dragon Elixir. Instead, he rested for half a year after taking each drop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After ten years, he had taken a total of twenty drops.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By this time, the Legendary Dragon Elixir had also lost its effect on Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his gains were tremendous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, all his elemental essence had broken through to Empyrean Sacredness. His spatial power essence, darkness elemental essence, lightning elemental essence, and fire elemental essence were incredibly close to mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, Osborne's Sacred Power became even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, he still hadn't fused the seventh power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, Osborne continued studying the construction of the Cosmic Translocator. After ten years, he had become quite familiar with it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he had already mastered the Level Three One-way Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he was most skilled at was the Level One One-way Cosmic Translocator. He could build one in just ten seconds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, ten seconds seemed to be his current limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get any faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe it's because my current strength and cultivation level aren't enough! If I want to build a Cosmic Translocator faster, or even complete it with a wave of my hand, I'll at least need to break through to Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't pay much attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "I still have eighteen years!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out a jadeflare vial containing only a drop of Dragon Elixir, but it shimmered with dazzling, multicolored light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is Perfect Dragon Elixir!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Legendary Dragon Elixir has lost its effect on me. Now, I can only use Perfect Dragon Elixir! Its effects must far surpass those of Legendary Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, my spatial power essence, darkness elemental essence, lightning elemental essence, and fire elemental essence all broke through mid Empyrean Sacredness! Additionally, I need to make my combat skills, Solar Sacred Arrow and Warfare Blade Technique, even stronger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eighteen years is absolutely enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne takes the Perfect Dragon Elixir, he will enter a longer Enlightenment State and gain more benefits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time will be the key to his strength transformation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne swallowed the Perfect Dragon Elixir without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, he felt himself plunged into chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was nothing around!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or rather, everything was there!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just felt dazed. His mind was filled with countless things he couldn't comprehend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his state, time passed quickly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
