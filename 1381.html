  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn</span><span>, upon being struck down, left no corpses behind; instead, they dissipated into a blood-red essence known as the high-grade death scent. This sinister vapory residue was notorious for eroding Divine Bodies at a mere touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any sane individual would instinctively steer clear of such a terrifying presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, actively absorbing this potent high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more astonishing, as it fed on the death scent, Osborne felt the dryness within </span><span>the Lotus subtly shift, as though it was regaining a spark of vitality. Though the change was nearly imperceptible to the naked eye, he could sense its revival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was coming back to life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This filled him with exhilaration. Osborne had been searching for a way to restore the Lotus from its wilted state because only through its revival could his own wounds heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, he had found no means to achieve this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, at last, there was a solution!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-grade death scent left behind by the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> could rejuvenate the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clearly, there's a true connection between the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> and the Blood Clan. I don't yet know the exact nature of this bond, but if I can eliminate the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> and absorb the high-grade death scent, I can restore the Lotus. This is manageable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I have to do is lure in more </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> and gather all that precious high-grade death scent! Simple enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought igniting his resolve, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn</span><span> had an incredible sense of smell, capable of detecting the essence of living beings from great distances. Driven by instinct, they would rush toward any living creature, craving their blood and flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Osborne had never encountered a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, so he hadn't taken care to mask his aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seasoned hunters knew better; they would go to great lengths to conceal their essence whenever they ventured into the wilds. The better they could hide, the easier it was to avoid </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Osborne possessed the Eclipsing Mantra, having mastered it to its third level. This technique excelled at concealing one's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted, he could cloak himself entirely, leaving no trace of his aura behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could even approach a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> undetected, as if he were merely a rock in the terrain, invisible to their predatory instincts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, today was different. He needed to attract the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, to draw them close, allowing them to relinquish their high-grade death </span><span>scent</span><span> to the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he would not only refrain from using the Eclipsing Mantra but would actively unleash his blood energy, allowing his life force to radiate outward, beckoning the nearby </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined pulse, Osborne unleashed his life aura, making no effort to hide it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He settled into silence, waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Essence Crystal mining site, a place that had been swept clear by the Ninth Dark Deity Legion countless times. The stronger </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> had already been eliminated, leaving behind only a handful of weaker ones or newly spawned creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the area was mostly free of particularly powerful </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Harry and Amelia would have been devoured long ago while mining for Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This, of course, was why Osborne felt confident enough to ignite his life energy, inviting the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If things get out of hand, I can always unleash the Eclipsing Mantra! I should be fine," he reassured himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne sensed the approach of </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>. Their blatant surge of life energy had drawn their attention, and within a six-mile radius, they could feel his essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, there weren't many in the vicinity&mdash;only a dozen or so </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> were heading his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>! The rest are Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced as he quickly activated the Eclipsing Mantra, effectively shrouding his life energy. He couldn't risk attracting </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> from further afield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current condition, facing even two Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> was a considerable gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for the sake of reviving the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he was ready to take that risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once cloaked, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> around him stumbled in confusion, losing track of his precise position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They began to wander aimlessly, like lost children, turning in circles as he stealthily positioned himself behind one of the Class S </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Target the weak first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his injuries, tackling a Class S </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> was still well within his capabilities. As the ancestor of the Blood Clan, he could assert dominance over them, instilling a deep-rooted fear that made his task easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift, decisive move, Osborne struck, dispatching the Class S </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creature burst into a wave of blood-red, high-grade death scent, the very essence he sought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment Osborne unleashed his power, his aura spilled into the surrounding air, causing the nearby </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> to snap back to reality and charge toward him in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, he was quick on his feet. With lightning speed, he activated the Eclipsing Mantra once again, obscuring his presence just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> around him fell back into a state of bewilderment, their earlier confidence shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a moment to breathe, Osborne focused on the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, urging it to absorb the rich, high-grade death scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his delight, he sensed a slight flicker of vitality returning to the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Motivated by the progress, Osborne repeated his strategy. One by one, he efficiently took down the Class S </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> in quick succession, his resolve strengthening with each kill.</span></p><div class="pagination">
