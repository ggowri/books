  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne unleashed the power of his right leg's Divine Bone, he sent the </span><span>second Class</span><span> S Titan King crashing to the ground. But at that moment, his Light Realm finally shattered under the relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense drain on his mental strength forced him to spit out a mouthful of blood, his face twisting in pain and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Light Realm had barely held up for ten seconds against the onslaught of several Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that his Level Four Light Realm was weak; it was just that Osborne's own level was too low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At only Class AAA, he was far from being able to withstand such overwhelming power. If he had been Class S himself, even eighty Class S clones wouldn't have been able to break through in such a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa Queen's triumphant smirk faltered as she realized that Osborne had just taken down two Titan Kings. Anger and murderous intent flickered across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had sent ten Class S clones into battle, and in a matter of moments, Osborne had already dispatched five of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only five remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had lost his Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with just five of them left, they were confident they could finish him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!" The five Class S clones surged forward in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Medusa Queens' eyes ignited with power as they unleashed their petrification abilities on Osborne. Instantly, his body was engulfed in a thick layer of stone skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of alarm; he could feel his body seizing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Medusa Queen's petrification power was manageable, only slowing him down a bit, but with both of them attacking together, he found himself completely immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren King seized the opportunity, charging at Osborne with reckless abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the two Wolf Kings unleashed a flurry of razor-sharp claws, surrounding him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danger loomed over him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his body trapped, Osborne could only tap into his spatial power, desperate to teleport away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as a rift began to tear open, it was shattered by the Wolf Kings' claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A torrent of devastating attacks rained down on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his formidable defenses, he couldn't withstand the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body was riddled with countless wounds, and the brutal impact from the Tauren King left his chest caved in, bones splintering as he was sent flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he even hit the ground, hundreds of Class AA and Class AAA clones closed in, unleashing a relentless barrage of attacks that overwhelmed him entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's martial art aura crumbled, leaving him utterly defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light of Redemption!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne activated his Light of Redemption, restoring himself to peak condition and summoning his martial art aura for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the hundreds of attacks crashed down once more, shattering his martial art aura again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just when he thought he might catch a break, the five Class S clones were already closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was grim; he was cornered, surrounded by an overwhelming number of foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had deployed two thousand clones, and while most were busy attacking Serena and the others, over a hundred were now focused on him alongside those five Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a dire situation, Osborne couldn't hope to defend himself, let alone escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena and the others were in no position to come to his aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa Queen cackled, relishing the sight of Osborne's despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm giving you a chance. Surrender and swear your loyalty to the great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. We can spare your life! You have potential, and as long as you're willing to be a loyal dog to the King, you can escape death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face hardened even further at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fighting off the relentless onslaught, he retorted coldly, "Medusa Queen, you're</span><span> </span><span>a twisted creature. You're willing to be a dog for Gerardo&mdash;does that mean everyone else should be like you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you'd just lick my boots, I might actually consider letting you live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa Queen's fury ignited at his words, her face twisting in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Since you can't see the writing on the wall</span><span>, then </span><span>you're</span><span> better off dead! Guys, kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the five Class S clones surged forward. Their attacks became even more frenzied with over a hundred Class AA and Class AAA clones' powers. Osborne felt like a tiny boat lost in a stormy sea, on the verge of capsizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His recently recovered body was soon covered in fresh wounds, his complexion growing paler by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't take much more of this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is this how it ends? Am I really going to die here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I haven't found my parents... I haven't rescued Grandpa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's so much left to do... I can't just die like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an explosive blast, Osborne was launched backward, blood spraying from his mouth, as if his very body was coming apart at the seams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More attacks rained down on him, and once again, he was engulfed by the chaos.</span></p><div class="pagination">
