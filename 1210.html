  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Beast Tide is attacking Hearin City?" Osborne's brow furrowed deeply at the alarming news. Rosmandi boasted two world-class cities: Newport City and Hearin City. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearin City was even larger than Newport, with a population of over 30 million. It was a global financial powerhouse, embodying wealth and prosperity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, Osborne rushed to the conference room. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he found his grandfather Sebastian, along with Anastasia, Matthew, Bryce, Wesson, and other key figures. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the intelligence department were also present, their faces grave as they acknowledged Osborne's arrival with quick, respectful salutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before them, a massive screen displayed satellite images, though the details were somewhat obscured. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was clear enough to see the chaotic scene unfolding in Hearin City, where the ominous Beast Tide surged like a dark wave, relentlessly assaulting the metropolis. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buildings crumbled under the onslaught, and the sheer size of the Beast Tide made it appear as if it were a swarm of ants intent on devouring the city whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice sliced through the tension. "The Beast Tide has already erupted? What's going on? Didn't I instruct the intelligence department to monitor this? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I made it clear that any signs of a Beast Tide gathering should be reported immediately so I could lead the Blood Demon members to eliminate them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are we only hearing about this now, when it's already in full swing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was sharp, and the gravity of his anger washed over the room, leaving the intelligence leaders visibly pale and trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian interjected calmly, "Osborne, we can't place the blame solely on the intelligence department."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused, tempering his frustration. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, what do you mean? Does our Draco Group's intelligence department lack the ability to track this? The Beast Tide around Hearin City couldn't have just formed out of nowhere! Why didn't they catch wind of it sooner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian took a deep breath, maintaining his composure. "This isn't the intelligence department's fault. Hearin City lies within the territory of the Deschanel family, a region our intel doesn't cover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family's territory? What does that mean?" Osborne's frown deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian explained, "The Deschanel family is the second-ranked Ancient Family in Rosmandi. They're a formidable superpower with a legacy that predates even ours. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've effectively fortified Hearin City, making it a stronghold that even the Augustine family and the Draco Group cannot penetrate. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo conquered nearly all fifty provinces of Rosmandi, obliterating any Ancient Families or superpowers that resisted him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, he never dared provoke the Deschanel family. Even someone as audacious as Gerardo recognized their strength and chose to steer clear of them. The Deschanel family's power is shrouded in mystery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the past, I would have avoided crossing them too. When you instructed the intelligence department to investigate the Beast Tide situation in Rosmandi, they did send operatives to Hearin City. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, they were turned away by the Deschanel family's forces. They warned us against interfering in Hearin City's affairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's words lingered in the air as Osborne raised an eyebrow. "So, there was a conflict?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded. "The Deschanel family is quite aggressive. To avoid stepping on their toes, our operatives withdrew from Hearin City, which is why they failed to pick up on the Beast Tide until it was too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief. "The Deschanel family is that powerful? They actually took action against our intelligence operators? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And they had the gall to threaten us not to interfere in Hearin City? I had no idea the Deschanel family was such a force to be reckoned with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian replied matter-of-factly, "They've kept a low profile. But just moments ago, we received a distress signal from other factions within Hearin City. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Beast Tide is massive, comparable to the ones that hit Lafier City in Yalynch, Harbino City in Marcelin, Denferes City in Ransford, and Mayano City in Easionand. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's incredibly formidable. Even with the Deschanel family's strength, they might not withstand something like this. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't act fast, Hearin City could be reduced to rubble, and 30 million innocent lives could be lost to the Beast Tide's wrath. The factions within Hearin City are desperate for our help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, this is where we stand. We've clashed with the Deschanel family in the past, and they aren't reaching out to us for assistance. It's up to you to decide whether we'll mobilize to Hearin City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, the Deschanel family isn't coming to us for help? Only the other factions in Hearin City have sought our aid?" Osborne's frown deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze returned to the satellite images on the screen, revealing the chaos unfolding in Hearin City. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buildings were crumbling, and the once-vibrant city was being quickly swallowed up by the Beast Tide. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given the severity of the situation, why hasn't the Deschanel family reached out? What could they possibly be thinking?" he muttered, frustration simmering just beneath the surface.</span></p><div class="pagination">
