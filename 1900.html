  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Ascendance Technique? Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured in shock. He couldn't believe that as his dark elemental essence broke through to Level Nine, he had been granted a Divine Ascendance Technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't the Divine Ascendance Technique something only a Supernal Deity King can master?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, that was what his grandfather Jethro had said&mdash;that only after reaching the Supernal Deity King level could one wield such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, somehow grasping it during his Level Nine breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only at the pinnacle of the mid-stage Deity King level right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I actually use the Divine Ascendance Technique now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uncertain, Osborne decided to give it a shot. After absorbing the knowledge, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Hope Haven shook once more as countless Shadow Drakes materialized around Osborne, converging like a storm and racing toward every corner of the sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anything that crossed their path vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Shadow Drakes charged directly toward Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a chill ran down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out! Defend yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia reacted the fastest, unleashing her divine power and summoning the Ultimate Luminous Armor as a shield for everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, she collided with the Shadow Drake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia coughed up blood, her face turning pale as she was sent flying, unable to withstand the impact. While the Ultimate Luminous Armor held firm, the sheer force had still injured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her hurt, Zoe, Mila, and the others quickly sprang into action, channeling all their strength to fend off the Shadow Drake's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all thrown back, blood spilling from their lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that split second, the Shadow Drake vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally realized something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only intended to test out the Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes&mdash;and was astonished at how effortlessly he had unleashed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes left him stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't even gone all out, yet he had summoned countless Shadow Drakes, each one annihilating everything in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Anastasia, who had reached the advanced Deity King Level, couldn't withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, Mila, and the others working together hadn't stood a chance, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne reacted quickly and retracted the Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes before the rampaging Shadow Drakes could inflict serious harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "What incredible power! What terrifying dark energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like my dark energy is so much stronger than before&mdash;almost like... Lord Malevolence's dark energy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization left Osborne both shocked and thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew his strength had surged tremendously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had felt the terrifying weight of Lord Malevolence's dark energy firsthand. Even a mere fragment attached to Bryce's wound had taken everything he had to cleanse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his dark energy was nearly on par!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was no time to dwell on that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly appeared beside Anastasia and the others, channeling the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal them swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you all okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and the others looked at him in disbelief before shaking their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we're fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a look of regret, Osborne replied, "I'm so sorry! I was just testing out my new technique and lost control of the power. I'm glad you're all alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group was buzzing with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A new technique? What kind of new technique is this? The power is just insane! Those countless Shadow Drakes could destroy everything! Half of Hope Haven was almost flattened! We barely survived an encounter with just one of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all remained in shock, their eyes wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke up, "I'm not sure why it's so powerful. It's a result of my dark elemental essence breaking through to Level Nine. It's called the Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped in unison, "Divine Ascendance Technique?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it supposed to be something only a Supernal Deity King can master? You've mastered it already?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are a monster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder we couldn't stand against it! This is the Divine Ascendance Technique we're talking about! A huge part of the Supernal Deity King's strength comes from that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you've already got it down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear, your Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes is even stronger than your grandfather's Gale of Netherworld!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group looked at Osborne with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "There's still a gap, though! Grandpa's Gale of Netherworld hits with only a fraction&mdash;about one percent&mdash;of its full power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others rolled their eyes. "He's an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King! What level are you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
