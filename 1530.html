  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Hannah finished speaking, her cheeks turned a bright shade of crimson, resembling a ripe peach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly lowered her head, wishing she could just vanish into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah mused, "How could I have let such words slip out? Will he think I am too forward or lacking in modesty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, regret washed over her, but there was also a flicker of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on the other hand, was momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood what Hannah meant, but as soon as he heard the term "marriage into the family," he instinctively shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I'm not interested in that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah froze, her eyes wide in surprise. She didn't realize he was rejecting the idea of entering the family, thinking instead that he was outright rejecting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of discomfort washed over her, and she felt a sudden urge to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her throat felt tight, and she bit her lip before stammering, "I... I was just joking! Anyway, thank you for saving my life. I'll never forget it! If I get the chance, I'll definitely repay you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, you've helped the Gellar family deal with the Deathborn threat in the mines, so we won't forget you either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, I just remembered&mdash;I have some important matters to attend to. I need to go now. Sorry, I can't walk you back. You'll have to make your own way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you next time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Hannah turned on her heel and dashed away, disappearing from Osborne's sight in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's leaving just like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We came here together, and she just takes off? Is that really okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though, to be honest, I wasn't planning on going back with her anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head in resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marry into the family? No way! Not happening! Even if the Goddess of Life herself were to come back, I wouldn't consider it! Besides, I've already got Isa and Clarissa; there's no way I'm entering anyone's family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he pushed the thoughts aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating his Satan's Eye, he confirmed that Hannah had indeed flown off in the Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a spark of inspiration, he thought, "Now it's just me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Hannah around, I can finally do what I want without holding back! This is the No. 13 mining area, one of the richest spots for Essence Crystals around Wild Flame City. The top twenty zones all have top-grade Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since I'm here, there's no way I'm leaving empty-handed. I'm going to scour the No. 13 mining area and clean out all the top-grade Essence Crystals belonging to the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I want them to be short on top-grade Essence Crystals for a long while! If possible, I'll even grab all the mid-grade Essence Crystals too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that determined thought, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gellar family's mining area was in Zone 8, surrounded by the Demonic Dragon Clan's Zone 7 and the Soaring Lion Clan's Zone 9.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he activated his Phantom Steps and slipped into the parallel space, heading straight for Zone 7 of the Demonic Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the strongest of the three Upper Races in Wild Flame City, the Demonic Dragon Clan had tight security around their mines. They not only stationed Deity Overlord warriors to guard the area but also deployed an elite mining protection team of thousands to patrol the site, ensuring no one dared to sneak in and mine secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even used Spirit Tracers; anyone who approached their territory would be detected immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, there had never been any incidents of Essence Crystal theft in their mining areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they know Osborne was about to turn their dreams into a nightmare. From the depths of parallel space, he slipped right into the heart of their mining area, rendering all their defenses utterly useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real ace up his sleeve? Osborne possessed Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This powerful ability allowed him to effortlessly pinpoint the Essence Crystals hidden within the mine. With his spatial power, he could easily scoop up mid-grade and top-grade Essence Crystals, all without a soul noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The operation was smooth and silent. Even with thousands of patrolling guards and countless slave miners working tirelessly, none were aware of Osborne's stealthy actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, the number of Essence Crystals here is definitely more than in Zone 9! The density is off the charts, and there are way more top-grade Essence Crystals than I ever expected!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this is just Zone 8! The higher-ranked areas must be even richer, with even more top-grade Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm about to hit the jackpot!" Osborne thought, excitement bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one hour, he had already amassed over 10 million mid-grade Essence Crystals and a staggering 100 thousand top-grade Essence Crystals from Zone 8 alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This haul surpassed everything he had collected in the No. 9 mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he had barely scratched the surface, having explored less than ten percent of Zone 8!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that if he cleaned out the core depths of Zone 8, he could potentially gather ten times more Essence Crystals! If he managed to scour the entire No. 13 mining area, he would undoubtedly become the wealthiest person in the entire East Zone!</span></p><div class="pagination">
