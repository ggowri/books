  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man approached Osborne with cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class A+, able to defeat Aresta, Sene, and Melanie one after another. You truly are impressive!" he said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, you cannot change the fate of the Augustine family. The Rosenthal family will still win today's betting match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will leave with the two divine artifacts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied indifferently, "Those three I defeated said the same, yet look at the results, they all lost. You'll end up the same way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man smiled faintly, "It's different. I'm not like them. I won't give you a chance. Though I rank twentieth among the Godsons of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>, that's only because I chose not to push for a higher rank after qualifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I wanted, I could easily break into the top ten or even the top five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In your Augustine family, only Emma can pressure me a bit, and as for you, no matter your means, I will easily defeat you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he wore a proud expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Palmers Rosenthal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get started."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Palmers spoke, powerful energy surged around her, plunging the area into darkness where no light could penetrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I forgot to tell you that I don't master the light elemental but its counterpart, the dark elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the darkness, get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers' voice echoed, shocking the Augustine family members as even their Satan's Eye failed to pierce the darkness, rendering them unable to sense any energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dark Realm?" Emma exclaimed. "The advanced use of dark elemental, the Realm. He has mastered the power of the Realm. Although in its preliminary form, it's more than Osborne can handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is over..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a piercing scream erupted from the darkness, causing the Augustine family to close their eyes in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he still lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, they sensed something was off. The scream hadn't come from Osborne but from Palmers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked and confused at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the darkness quickly dissipated. Everyone could finally see the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers collapsed on the ground with a gaping wound on her neck, blood pouring out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers had fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby stood Osborne, coldly smiling as he sheathed a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned, even Emma frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers had cast his Dark Realm, and logically, Osborne should have had no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in an instant, he had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Palmers had fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrific wound on Palmers' throat indicated that if Osborne hadn't held back, his head would have been cut off, and he would be dead now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Osborne do it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark elemental power." Everett suddenly exclaimed, and his expression dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've mastered not only the light elemental power but also the dark. You truly are a heretic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Class S Supreme Overlord, he had witnessed the battle clearly despite the darkness. He saw how Osborne, seemingly unaffected by the Dark Realm, zeroed in on Palmers' position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of his overconfidence, he had torn through the dimensional rift and attacked from behind, slitting his throat before he could respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers had underestimated Osborne, thinking him an easy target within his Dark Realm, and was defeated before he could truly showcase his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He failed miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett stared at Osborne angrily, wishing he could kill him. With Palmers' defeat, the bet battle between the two superpowers was also over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lost, and the cost was two divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unacceptable to Everett. He had made a lot of preparations for this fight and even asked Palmers, who had mastered the Dark Realm, to come and support him to ensure that they could win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, they lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's words clarified the crowd's confusion as they looked at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has mastered the dark elemental too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many elemental essences does he have? Space, Lightning, Earth, Light, and Dark. He's absorbed at least five elemental essences, or even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five elemental essences? That exceeds even Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His Satan's Eye is incredibly powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family, stunned, could hardly contain their shock at Osborne's unexpected triumph.</span></p><div class="pagination">
