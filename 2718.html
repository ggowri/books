  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the battle stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana stared in disbelief at the sixty people, then exclaimed, "That's Evernight Court's Emperor Anthony!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you warriors of Evernight Court?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! You're the president of Phantom Commerce Guild, Mr. Lillard! Are Phantom Commerce Guild's warriors here too?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the sixty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors all bowed to Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Master!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Adriana gasped, and everyone present was stunned, staring at Frederick in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled faintly and waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No need for formalities!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick looked at Adriana with disdain and laughed, "Ms. Alba, now you've seen my trump card. Are you satisfied? I forgot to tell you, in fact, thousands of years ago, I had already secretly taken control of Evernight Court and Phantom Commerce Guild!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On the surface, Racial Convergence Planet has three top-tier powers, but in reality, they are all under my control! Whether it's Emperor Anthony of Evernight Court or Mr. Lillard of Phantom Commerce Guild, they are all my people!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I should say, they are just dogs under my control! Whoever I tell them to bite, they bite. I have long been the absolute ruler of Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick looked proud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was completely stunned. If she hadn't seen Anthony of Evernight Court and Russell of Phantom Commerce Guild respectfully standing behind Frederick at this moment, she would never have believed Frederick's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anthony and Russell are warriors on the same level as Frederick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their strength and influence should be on the same level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Frederick actually controlled them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All three top-tier powers on Racial Convergence Planet belong to Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana felt a chill all over. No one could have imagined that Frederick's trump card was this, and that he had secretly controlled all the supreme warriors of Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is bad!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's expression was grave as she growled, "Emperor Frederick, how did you do it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick smiled faintly, "As long as one's strength is strong enough, anything is possible! Just because no one has done it before doesn't mean I can't! Anyway, forcing me to reveal my true trump card is already quite impressive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you still have to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick's gaze turned terrifying as he said coldly, "Now that you know my secret, go die! Everyone, kill them all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, Master!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Anthony, Russell, and sixty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors from Evernight Court and Phantom Commerce Guild joined the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are too powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially Anthony and Russell, who are Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors. Apart from Adriana and Weston, no one on Osborne's side could stop them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was entangled by Frederick, and Weston was also held up by Callista. No one could stand against Anthony and Russell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After just one clash, three people on Osborne's side were killed, and more than a dozen were injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, he used the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to quickly heal the injured, restoring their combat strength to continue fighting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for those who had died, Osborne could do nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he copied these people's life essence and could resurrect them, it would take time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the midst of this intense battle, he simply didn't have that much time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle grew fiercer, but it became one-sided. Frederick's subordinates, led by Anthony and Russell, two Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, tore through Osborne's defenses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People on Osborne's side kept dying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "No! This can't go on, or everyone will die here! Even I might not be able to escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must change the current situation!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clenched his teeth, his eyes cold. He quickly took out the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Good thing I felt something was off earlier, so I held back from using the Apocalypse Bow and Heaven Arrow. Otherwise, it would be trouble now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And now, what I need to do is..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne set his sights on Anthony and Russell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are both Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne has no one on his side who can resist them. Even if he doesn't use the Apocalypse Bow, he's no match for the two of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I must deal with the two of them to have a chance to turn the tide! Unfortunately, the Apocalypse Bow can only shoot one arrow, so at most, I can take down one of them! Their Soul Current Ocean hasn't been parasitized by the Soulbane Parasite, so I can't control them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and ultimately chose Anthony.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anthony was on a killing spree at the moment. No one could withstand his attacks, but suddenly, he felt a chill rush to the top of his head, sensing an intense threat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instantly looked toward the direction of the threat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he saw Osborne had already drawn the Apocalypse Bow. The dazzling Sacred Power Arrow was aimed at Anthony, instantly making him feel a chill all over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dodge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick's voice echoed in Anthony's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He can only shoot one arrow. If you dodge it, he won't be a threat to you anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anthony began dodging frantically without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, the Sacred Power Arrow shot from the Apocalypse Bow wasn't easy to evade. Once Anthony was locked on, even as a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, he couldn't escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow struck Anthony. He let out a scream as all his defenses, as fragile as paper, were instantly torn apart and shattered. The terrifying arrow pierced through his body, ripping his flesh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anthony fell to the ground, his life fading quickly. He was actually killed by Osborne with a single arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he was the emperor of the Evernight Court!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was one of the three most powerful people on Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Russell, another Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, looked shocked and quickly distanced himself from Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick roared, "You bastard, you deserve to die! Russell, kill him immediately! He can only shoot one arrow, he&rsquo;s no longer a threat to you. No matter what, kill him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Russell's fear and dread quickly vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So you can only shoot one arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then you're doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, as Russell charged at Osborne, the terrifying power of a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior erupted and fiercely attacked him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, watch out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana instantly felt panic and worry. She wanted to rush over to help Osborne fend off Russell, but she was entangled by Frederick, leaving her no chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Russell's terrifying attack had already enveloped Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze was cold and sharp. He did not panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a magnificent Panoply Armor appeared on him, an Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Russell's terrifying attack landed but was completely blocked by his Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor.</span></p><div class="pagination">
