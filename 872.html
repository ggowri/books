  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was momentarily taken aback by Emma's words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She quickly filled him in on the situation, her eyes darting nervously toward him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma was worried that Osborne might be angry with her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, it was she who had provoked Clarissa, who had insisted on competing with Clarissa, and who had been the one to reveal their relationship to Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma had once told Osborne that she didn't care about status, about whether he would marry her, or how it might affect his relationship with Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, it seemed she had broken that promise.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of Osborne being upset, or worse, choosing to distance himself from her, gnawed at Emma.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew all too well that in Osborne's heart, her position could never compare to Clarissa's. If it weren't for her forceful method, they probably wouldn't even be together.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's anxiety was evident.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, Osborne looked at Emma, who appeared fearful, and couldn't help but smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry; I'm not mad at you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This was bound to happen sooner or later! If anyone's at fault here, it's me for not controlling my own desires," Osborne added, giving her a gentle pat on the head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why don't you head back for now? I need to talk to Clarissa. Since she's already aware of everything, it's time to clear the air. I'll face the consequences of my own mistakes."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's expression softened as she gazed at him, relief washing over her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really okay with this?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded. "Yeah, I'll be fine."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma said, "Just make sure you talk things through with Clarissa. If... and I mean if... she can't handle it, you can always choose to let me go!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't cling to you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she turned and left, leaving Osborne to watch her retreating figure with a shake of his head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He tore open a dimensional rift and stepped through.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the blink of an eye, he found himself in the luxurious mansion where Clarissa lived.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne! You're finally out!" Clarissa exclaimed, her eyes lighting up as she sensed his presence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She rushed toward Osborne, throwing herself into his arms and wrapping her arms tightly around his waist.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne froze for a moment. From Clarissa's radiant face, he saw no signs of distress.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa looked just as she always did, her typically icy demeanor melting into a warm smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if she was completely unaware of his situation with Emma, which he knew was impossible.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gently cupped her face, his expression softening. "Yeah, I'm out! How's life treating you here, Clarissa?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She nodded enthusiastically. "It's been good! But how was your time away? Did you achieve what you wanted? Are you feeling confident about the Honor Quest Ceremony?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa started to say more, but Osborne interrupted her gently, "Clarissa, you know about Emma, right? I'm sorry."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's smile suddenly froze, her body stiffening in place.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa, I'm sorry, I didn't..." Osborne began, but Clarissa pressed a finger to his lips, silencing him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head gently.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, there's no need to apologize or explain. I understand everything!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without another word, she tugged on his hand, guiding him toward the living room.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was puzzled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "What's going on with her? Is she upset?" Her demeanor left him feeling a bit lost.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne followed her into the spacious living room, where Dylan, Eugen, Donna, and Barlyn were all gathered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their faces brightened when they saw the two of them enter hand in hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne! You made it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We heard about the Honor Quest Ceremony. We may not be able to help you much, but we believe in you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, you've got this!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled back, still unsure why Clarissa had brought him here.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa smiled at Eugen, "Grandpa, can you tell Osborne how many wives you've had in your life?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugen was momentarily taken aback. "Why do you want to know that? Don't you already know how many grandmothers you have?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I do, but I want to hear it from you," Clarissa insisted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a faint smile, Eugen replied, "I've married six wives in my lifetime. I loved them all sincerely, and they treated me well in return. It's a shame, though&mdash;I couldn't protect them. They've all left this world now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A glimmer of nostalgia and sorrow filled his eyes as he spoke.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne listened, struck by the weight of Eugen's words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa then turned to Dylan. "Dad, how many wives have you had?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dylan rubbed his nose, looking slightly sheepish. "I've had four. Your mother is the fourth. You already know this, right? Why are you asking?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa nodded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shifted her gaze to Donna. "Aunt Donna, how many wives does Uncle have besides you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Donna glanced between Clarissa and Osborne, a knowing look crossing her face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, she replied, "Your uncle has three wives besides me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa nodded again, then turned to Barlyn with a playful grin. "Barlyn, how many wives do you plan to have in the future?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Barlyn's eyes lit up with excitement. "Well, obviously, the more the merrier!"</p><div class="pagination">
