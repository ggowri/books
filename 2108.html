  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! You're all dead; who's gonna know I was behind it? Revenge? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda looked down at the fallen Monica with disdain. With a casual wave of her hand, flames erupted, engulfing all the remaining bodies, and turning them to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a member of the Nature Elf Clan, she felt a natural affinity for all elements. While plant elemental was her primary power, she dabbed in others too&mdash;just not as deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, everything around them was reduced to cinders, obliterating all evidence of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should anyone stumble upon this place, they'd find nothing but the remnants of burnt earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get moving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda and Osborne swiftly made their way into a branching crevice, diving deeper into the unknown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This new section of the chasm was barren and devoid of life, yet Alfreda felt no disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their previous haul had been tremendous&mdash;twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals to be exact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, determination in her tone, "Osborne, I'll admit it&mdash;I lost our little contest! You snagged way more Element Gold Crystals and took down more enemies than I did. So, according to our deal, I only need seven of those crystals; you keep the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That works out perfectly. I got seven, you got twenty-one, so you won't owe me anything more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned back, pulling out the twenty-one Element Gold Crystals he had won. He took seven Spatial Gold Crystals and handed over the remaining fourteen Element Gold Crystals to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "No need! I was just joking with you before. Don't take it seriously! Of these twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals, I only need seven Spatial Gold Crystals. I don't need the other twenty-one at all. I'll give them all to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda hurriedly took the fourteen Element Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she heard what Osborne said, she was immediately stunned. "No way! You must be out of your mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fourteen Element Gold Crystals? You're just giving them to me? Have you completely lost it? Sure, they might not match your elemental affinity, but you could trade them back home for ones that do!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you get hurt in your head? Please don't joke about this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him anxiously, concern etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rolling his eyes, Osborne replied, "I think maybe you're the one who's lost it! I don't want these Element Gold Crystals. I'm fine handing them over to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a teasing glance, he continued, "Hey, just pretend this is me wanting to make sure your strength increases. As my teammate, your current level isn't quite up to par! So, I'm giving you these extra Element Gold Crystals so you can level up faster and not be a burden."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes widened in disbelief. "What?! Me? A burden? You must be kidding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King! You're only at Ascension Two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot him a glare, full of indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed. "So, do you think you could actually beat me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Alfreda stammered, her confidence faltering momentarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just you wait! If you don't use your absolute forbidden zone to suppress my cultivation level, I'll make sure to give you a serious beating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled again. "Why would I not use my absolute forbidden zone? It's right there in my arsenal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cheater!" Alfreda turned her head away, pretending to ignore him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced down at the fourteen Element Gold Crystals in her hands, feeling an unexpected warmth deep within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because deep down, Alfreda knew Osborne didn't really view her as weak; he was just using this as a means to share resources with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fourteen Element Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By all rights, they were his, but he chose to give them to her instead. It was a big deal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touched by his generosity, Alfreda resolved silently to repay him someday. She might not be good at expressing her feelings, but she'd always remember this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, how about we take some time to meditate and train here?" Osborne suggested, breaking the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had decided to share those fourteen Element Gold Crystals with Alfreda because his Dimensional Space was overflowing with over five hundred of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, with more than two hundred of his clones scattered across the chasms, they were constantly on the lookout for treasures, uncovering plenty of Element Gold Crystals each day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, the ordinary Element Gold Crystals had lost their value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Alfreda, Osborne wouldn't have even set foot in Umbra Earth, so he wanted to share more with her while he had the chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Train for a while?" Alfreda echoed thoughtfully, then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good! With these Element Gold Crystals, I can definitely level up my strength! Umbra Earth is way too dangerous. My current power is not enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, this land is massive; the mushroom forest and the Death Chasm are just tiny parts of it! Since we're here, we should explore deeper, and that means we need to be stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with determination as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending two days in Umbra Earth, the fear that once gripped her was beginning to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's train for ten days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With these Element Gold Crystals, I should be able to elevate my plant elemental essence to Level Ten! That's the threshold of Sacredness Level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reaching Level Ten will give me a huge boost in power. Plus, I'm on the verge of a cultivation breakthrough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the end of ten days, I might even hit Ascension Six! Then, if I run into Uriel, I could actually hold my ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, surprised by her confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then! Let's have a little competition and see who makes more progress in these ten days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda declared, her spirit ignited, "Bring it on! I'm not backing down this time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't lose to you again, even if you've got that absolute forbidden zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "We'll see about that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their challenge set, they set up some defensive barriers around them before parting ways to focus on their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne withdrew all eighteen of his Spatial Gold Crystals from his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Eighteen Spatial Gold Crystals should be enough to push my space elemental essence from its peak at Level Nine to Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder just how powerful that will be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's find out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing his eyes, Osborne began to absorb the energy from the Spatial Gold Crystals. As each crystal shattered into dust, he could feel his space elemental essence surging forward, pushing toward Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time slipped by slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, on the second day, he finished absorbing the last of the energy from the eighteen Spatial Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his space elemental essence reached a critical point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the final crystal's energy flowed into him, Osborne released any restraints on his space elemental essence, allowing it to expand freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, his space elemental essence underwent a transformation, achieving Level Ten!</span></p><div class="pagination">
