  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Name?" Osborne looked at the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon was also looking at him. Its six massive eyes across three heads were gazing at Osborne expectantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed to be eagerly awaiting its own name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "How about we call you Beefcake?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon was already 328 feet tall and 984 feet long at birth. In Osborne's eyes, it was a giant, and calling it Beefcake clearly suited its image perfectly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after he spoke, he clearly saw resistance and disappointment in the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial rolled its eyes. "If you can't name it, then don't. Beefcake? What does that even mean? It doesn't sound good at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose, feeling a bit awkward, thinking, "I really am not good at naming."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, then said, "How about you show me your abilities first? Then I'll name you based on them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon clearly understood what Osborne meant and nodded excitedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, a powerful force suddenly erupted from its body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scorching and terrifying lava around was immediately pushed away by this force, creating a vacuum area spanning dozens of miles without lava.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such an ability left Osborne utterly shocked because he couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon began its performance. It raised its central golden head and spewed a golden, flame-like particle stream.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, everything the particle stream passed was instantly disintegrated into the finest matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Dragon's Breath," Primordial said, "but its Dragon's Breath seems off. </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's </span><span>Dragon's</span><span> Breath should be gray flames, and it should only melt everything. But its Dragon's Breath is golden, and more terrifyingly, everything around it is being disintegrated."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's silver head also spewed out a Dragon's Breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this time the Dragon's Breath was silver.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything the Dragon's Breath touched was instantly melted. The terrifying scorching heat it brought made Osborne feel a stinging pain in his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This feels like a normal Dragon's Breath, but it's more powerful," Primordial commented.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling a bit excited. The Dragon's Breath spewed from </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's golden and silver heads turned out to be different&mdash;one could disintegrate matter, the other could melt it, yet both were incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What effect would the Dragon's Breath from the third blue head have?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the blue head of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon spewed out a blue Dragon's Breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt an icy chill. This freezing power was even more terrifying than the seventh layer of Arctic Maw Chasm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next moment, everything touched by the Dragon's Breath was frozen solid, completely encased in ice&mdash;even the terrifying molten lava was entirely frozen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the power of freezing," Osborne said with some delight. This power was so terrifying that even Osborne felt he might not be able to withstand it, even if he ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's quite formidable," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's performance was not over yet. The six pairs of blood-veined wings on its back began flapping rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon vanished from its original spot, appearing in the distance as if it had teleported. Its speed was so fast that even Osborne's Satan's Eye struggled to track its movements.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's so fast!" Osborne said in shock. "It's not just fast, but incredibly agile. With six pairs of wings, it can control its direction at high speed, moving in a zigzag pattern like lightning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With such speed and agility, ordinary warriors can't even land a hit on it. Its speed surpasses that of a mid-grade Sacred Artifact-class battleship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked, while the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon seemed to be having a lot of fun. Its massive body moved nimbly, and in Osborne's eyes, it was as if streaks of lightning were flying around him nonstop. He couldn't even make out its figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It has such a massive body, yet it's so agile, with speed as fast as lightning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly thought of something and said, "I'll call you Flash, representing your lightning speed and agility."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon stopped right in front of him. It tilted its head, seemingly thinking. Then, it nodded vigorously, a happy smile appearing on its face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon really liked the name Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and asked, "Flash, do you have any other abilities?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash immediately nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It revealed its sharp claws and pointed teeth. Then, it shook its head in frustration, as if saying its teeth and claws were powerful too, but there was nothing here to showcase their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then summoned the Eclipse War Armor. "Come on! Try attacking me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash shook its head violently, its eyes full of resistance, waving its sharp claws as if saying it couldn't do that. It was worried it might accidentally kill Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing its meaning, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "The strongest aspects of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon are its claws and Dragon's Breath. You think you can block its claw attack with the Eclipse War Armor? You're definitely courting death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An adult one can tear apart a star with a single claw. Even with the Warfare Shield, you might not be able to withstand it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think you shouldn't try. You'll have plenty of chances to understand Flash's abilities in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words, Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was very happy because he could feel Flash's reliance on him. Flash would carry out his orders without hesitation. Only when the order would harm Osborne would Flash refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne felt a close connection with Flash. He could convey his thoughts to Flash without speaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Flash still couldn't express its thoughts in words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Maybe it will start talking when it grows older."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. We should leave here." Osborne decided to leave because he was worried the Magma Devourer might suddenly return.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, he had left a Spatial Clone to monitor the Magma Devourer. However, when he was backfired by the sacrificial power, the Spatial Clone dissipated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne had no idea what was happening outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Has the battle between Mr. Norton and the Magma Devourer reached a conclusion? If the Magma Devourer suddenly returns to its lair and discovers that the Primordial Phoenix Sycamore branches, Radiant Fire Crystal, transparent coffin, and </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg have all been stolen by me, it will definitely hunt me down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter where I hide in the universe, the Magma Devourer will probably hunt me down to the death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wanted to go out quickly to check the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He flew up, landed on Flash's back, and prepared to experience Flash's speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash was very happy and immediately flapped its wings once Osborne steadied himself on its back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Flash dashed forward. The magma ahead parted on its own, creating a path. Osborne could only feel everything rushing backward at high speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they left the depths underground and returned to the surface.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash's speed was simply incredible!</span></p><div class="pagination">
