  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey was stunned, utterly taken aback as he watched Osborne vanish again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had unleashed the full power of the ten secondary cannons from the Supreme Malevolence Airship, and under normal circumstances, even a Deity Overlord warrior wouldn't be able to dodge every shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would at least suffer some hits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, all his attacks had missed, leaving Tobey in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a fleeting moment, he felt a strange energy before Osborne disappeared. It was something he recognized but couldn't place immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that... spatial energy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the realization hit him, Tobey's heart rate quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power? How is that even possible? He's having spatial power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spatial power holders were a rarity in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, and it had been ages since he had even heard whispers of such abilities. The only reason he recognized it was due to the Supreme Malevolence Airship's capabilities, which were derived from divine peak technology and allowed for a rudimentary form of interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time it made such a leap, the airship would be surrounded by an intense spatial energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As such, he was able to identify the spatial power Osborne was wielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the weight of the situation pressing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey mused, "To possess spatial power! That damned lowly human&mdash;why does he get to wield such advanced abilities? Why am I not the one with spatial power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This human's strength is more formidable than I ever anticipated. Without breaking through to Deity Overlord, I stand no chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thank the heavens for the Supreme Malevolence Airship... as long as I've got it, even if he's strong, he won't be able to breach my defenses or harm me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to get out of here and report back. The warriors of my clan will take care of him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, his fighting spirit drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he still had the main cannons at his disposal, he knew that with Osborne possessing spatial power, locking onto Osborne was nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tobey prepared to maneuver the Supreme Malevolence Airship to activate interdimensional travel, a cold, mocking laugh resonated from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment of shock, Tobey froze, a rush of panic flooding in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spun around to find Osborne standing right behind him, having somehow slipped past his defenses, a playful grin on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile widened. "So, you know I have spatial power? Why did you think I would try to break through the defenses of the Supreme Malevolence Airship? I could just use spatial power to get inside!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't break through your ship's defenses, why could I not crush your Divine Body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne summoned a surge of divine power around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of terrifying spatial energy enveloped Tobey, and he felt the world around him freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if invisible hands were compressing him from all sides, leaving him utterly paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ready to die?" Osborne taunted, taking slow, deliberate steps toward Tobey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear finally flickered in Tobey's eyes as he shouted, "No! You can't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a noble of the Paramount Supreme Clan! A genius among them! If you kill me, you'll regret it! The Paramount Supreme Clan rules </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, representing the esteemed Lord Malevolence himself. You can't do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, his voice dripping with disdain. "Noble? The Paramount Supreme Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't see anything noble about you. What sets you apart from the native Human Community of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>? Do you have an extra eye or a nose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just another Human Community member, shouting about your supposed superiority to elevate yourselves as descendants of Lord Malevolence. But guess what? That doesn't make you look more dignified&mdash;it just makes you look ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And here you are, trembling in the face of death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne spoke, he closed the distance between them, his presence overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His space elemental essence was already at the peak of Level Six, teetering on the brink of Level Seven. With his spatial power, he was far beyond what Tobey, a peak Celestial Deity, could contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey could only stare in terror as Osborne approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cried, desperation creeping into his voice, "Please, don't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm still young! I haven't even made a name for myself in </span><span>Celestara</span><span> yet. If you let me go, I can give you anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled mockingly. "Why go through all that trouble? Once you're dead, </span><span>everything you have will belong to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey shouted, panic rising. "No, it's not the same!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you kill me, the Paramount Supreme Clan will hunt you down! You can't even imagine their power; you won't escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? If that's the case, then I won't kill you. Instead, I think I'll turn you into my Blood Clan descendant."</span></p><div class="pagination">
