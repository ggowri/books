  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne finally arrived at the trial area of the Celestial Spire's twenty-seventh level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If Seraphina and the others keep clearing levels, they should have reached the eighteenth level by now. Can they pass the eighteenth level's trial?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Seraphina has no more tricks up her sleeve, she probably can't pass the eighteenth level's trial! But Frederick has prepared for so long; he must have given her some trump cards... Maybe she really can pass the trial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered and thought, "When Seraphina finally passes the eighteenth level's trial, only to find out that the key to the eighteenth level has already been taken, what kind of expression will she have?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That should be quite interesting!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Too bad I can't see it with my own eyes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked across from him. At this moment, a hundred warriors' projections appeared opposite him, all at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One hundred Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors' projections!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but murmur, "This level of difficulty is just insane! No one but me could possibly pass it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head and began his trial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors' projections, Osborne found it difficult to kill his opponents using the Solar Sacred Arrow's Human Arrow. He could only use the Earth Arrow for more effective damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Osborne decided to use the Heaven Arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Although the Earth Arrow can effectively harm them, it might still be blocked! With a hundred Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors' projections, if I don't kill them all and get surrounded, I'll be in great danger too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll just use the Heaven Arrow to quickly wipe them out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The radiant Sacred Power Arrow took shape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle began!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Heaven Arrow shot out, unleashing terrifying power. At this moment, Osborne unleashed his full strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The arrow's speed was simply too fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a deafening explosion tore through the air. Everything around them collapsed and disintegrated into nothingness. When the dust finally settled, the only thing still moving in the blinding light was Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The projections of those one hundred Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors were all crushed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cleared!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief. He finally cleared it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heaven Arrow is his strongest attack method.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If even Heaven Arrow couldn't eliminate all those warriors' projections, he would have to use other trump cards and methods.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still had many trump cards and methods unused. Those were enough to help him clear it in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, it's time to reap the rewards!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle points above his head had now reached 3.33 trillion!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a massive number.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But most importantly, after passing the 27th level's trial, he could obtain the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket, and the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket is the Apocalypse Bow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was once the strongest bow in the cosmos!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though the Apocalypse Bow now only has power comparable to a supreme Imperial Artifact, it can still greatly enhance Osborne's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne arrived in front of the Battle Points Monument.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He placed his hand on the Battle Points Monument. Osborne was once again enveloped in red light and entered that peculiar space. In front of him stood the guardian of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Young man, we meet again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby still said the same words. However, it seemed even more lively to Osborne, almost like a normal person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I'm here to claim the Apocalypse Bow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby fell silent for a long time upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, Toby finally said, "I never thought someone could truly pass the twenty-seventh level's trial and take the Apocalypse Bow! Back then, I thought..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, saying this is pointless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've already passed the twenty-seventh level's trial. According to the rules, the key to the Seventh Skyfall Casket, the Apocalypse Bow, is yours!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A red light flashed in front of Osborne, followed by the appearance of a space rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no sense of where this space rift led.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a dark red bow appeared in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dark red bow looked a bit worn, covered with countless scratches. Some scratches were so deep that Osborne worried the bow might break apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its dark red color came from the countless dark red specks on the bow, resembling dried blood!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the Apocalypse Bow?" Osborne murmured, staring at the Apocalypse Bow carefully, but he couldn't sense anything unusual. It just looked like an ordinary bow, not even as sturdy as his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this really the Apocalypse Bow, claimed to be the strongest bow in the cosmos?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Toby, you didn't lie to me?" Osborne asked doubtfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that the Apocalypse Bow wasn't as powerful as the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear. At least he could sense something extraordinary from the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this Apocalypse Bow was too ordinary!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby calmly said, "Of course, I didn't lie to you. It really is the Apocalypse Bow! You can't feel its power simply because it hasn't acknowledged you yet..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked, "Then why can I feel the power of the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear? Could it be that the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear has acknowledged me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby replied, "Of course not! The Violet-blooded Bronze Spear is far inferior to the Apocalypse Bow! Although they were both once Sovereign Artifacts, the gap between the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear and the Apocalypse Bow is immense!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, the Apocalypse Bow is more unique! Even though you've obtained it, whether you can use it is not up to you! It depends on whether the Apocalypse Bow acknowledges you. If it doesn't, then in your hands, it's just trash!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if it acknowledges you, even if you're just an advanced Empyrean Sacredness now, you might unleash its power without suffering any backlash."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still felt that Toby was deceiving him, but he had no evidence. If the Apocalypse Bow acknowledged him, with his current strength, he definitely wouldn't be able to control it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Advanced Empyrean Sacredness individuals will definitely suffer backlash when controlling an Imperial Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, the power of the Apocalypse Bow now is beyond that of an ordinary Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Forget it! Toby probably wouldn't lie to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I'll study this later!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today marks my sixth day in the Celestial Spire! I need to quickly exchange the battle points..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pondered what to exchange for.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His battle points were too many. Exchanging all 3.33 trillion battle points for Perfect Dragon Elixir would get him 3,330 drops!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he exchanged all his battle points for the most common Imperial Artifacts, he could get over 600 of them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But everyone can only consume two drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir, so Osborne didn&rsquo;t need that many at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then I'll exchange for 200 drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir first!" Osborne murmured. The effects of the Perfect Dragon Elixir were too powerful. He planned to prepare two drops each for Isa, Clarissa, and everyone else, as well as for his family on Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although with their current strength, they couldn't use the Perfect Dragon Elixir yet, Osborne planned to prepare it in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he left here, there would be no place to exchange battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne exchanged 200 drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What should I exchange for next?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
