  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb regarded the fuming Lance with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I pay no heed to such concerns. My duty is to the Branch Bloodline Competition, and I rank the branches based on their performance therein. The rest is beyond my purview.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The branch bloodline from Dampston may indeed be weak, but it is their very weakness that makes Osborne's victory all the more remarkable! I've said it before; Osborne is a miracle worker. I firmly believe that with him in the branch bloodline from Dampston, none would dare underestimate them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rolled his eyes once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He clearly knew Caleb didn't mean it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance looked gloomy and ceased arguing with Caleb because he was aware that his words would not alter the outcome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, he glared icily at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A miracle worker? He? We'll see about that! I'll show everyone that he's not worth the optimism!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's wait and see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Lance closed his eyes and hid his true emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could sense that Lance had come to despise him and viewed him as an adversary to be vanquished due to Caleb's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt helpless about this turn of events.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, he remained silent, for there was nothing to be said. He could willingly show weakness, but he would never grovel or surrender to his foes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the helicopter touched down at Mount Seven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bidding farewell to Caleb, Osborne spared not a glance for Lance and hastened back to Ninth Estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other members from Dampston were already awaiting his return at Ninth Estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne appeared, they surrounded him, their cheers resounding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you're incredible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, we're number one! The top of the Augustine family's nine branch bloodlines!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you're our hero!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, well done!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was ecstatic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before the Branch Bloodline Competition, most members had believed Dampston would surely place last. Even with their faith in Osborne, they had merely hoped he could prolong their endurance, avoiding the bottom rank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one had imagined Osborne would secure first place for Dampston!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">First place meant that for the next five years, Dampston would receive the most resources from the main bloodline, enabling the fastest growth in strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could they not be thrilled?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shared in their excitement and genuine happiness. Though not originally from Dampston, he also felt his sense of belonging had grown over time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was genuinely pleased to aid Dampston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Osborne was surprised to find his nominal 'sister,' Yulissa, absent from the celebration, hiding behind the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yulissa, why are you hiding back there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his words, the excited crowd fell silent, their expressions a mix of anger and grievance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa trembled but did not step forward, remaining concealed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it's nothing. I'm just tired. I'll rest first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa attempted to leave. Bowing head, she covered her face with her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sensed something amiss and deepened his frown. He believed that something must have happened to Yulissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne called out, "Yulissa, come here! Did something happen while I was away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa halted but did not turn around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you to come here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's tone was insistent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac coughed, speaking quickly, "Osborne, don't get upset. I'll explain everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked at Isaac, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened? Was Yulissa bullied?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac hesitated but nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yulissa was indeed bullied, but it's not serious. Just a minor injury. The matter is over, so you don't need to be worried. Your priority now is to rest and prepare well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've already become the heir-to-be. Having come this far, you must strive further and become the true heir of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't concern yourself with anything else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite Isaac's words, Osborne's frown remained. A murmur escaped his lips, "Was Yulissa really bullied?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, Osborne appeared beside Yulissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He grasped her arm and turned her to face him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me see!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa shook her head and tried to bury her face, refusing revealing her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne was not to be deterred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Easily parting her hands, Osborne revealed her visage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instantly, a flicker of anger ignited in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A clear slap mark marred Yulissa's delicate face. Its blue-black hue was a testament to the force behind the blow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her delicate face was slightly swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne's gaze fell upon her, tears welled in Yulissa's eyes, spilling down her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, she managed a smile, "Osborne, I'm fine! It doesn't hurt at all. Really!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's heart was ablaze with fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who did this?" he demanded coldly.</p><div class="pagination">
