  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer had a knack for stirring the crowd's curiosity. He began with a simple introduction of the last batch of slaves, elite captives from the human resistance of the West Zone, but then he made a sharp turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, this group of slaves consists entirely of disabled individuals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were once Superior Deities, Transcendent Deities, and many were even Celestial Deity warriors. Now, they're gravely injured&mdash;stripped of their powers, many are missing limbs or have lost their sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, these slaves are practically useless. You can't expect them to work in your mines or contribute to your families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, if you manage to heal their wounds and restore their former strength, that changes everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To me, they represent a kind of honor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These prisoners are trophies from our Dark Deity Legion's victory over the West Zone resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are 52 hundred of them, and the starting bid is a mere one million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, please, take a close look at their current state."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, images began to flicker on the massive screen behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chilling battle cries echoed through the room, and even though it was just a recording, it sent a shiver down the spines of everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere grew heavy with dread as the screen displayed a brutal and bloody conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one side stood the formidable Dark Deity Legion, a massive force, while on the other was a group known as the "Pioneers of Starlight," a human resistance faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion numbered in the millions, while the Pioneers were barely 50 thousand strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming might of the Dark Deity Legion had completely surrounded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, not a single member of Pioneers of Starlight surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being outnumbered twenty to one, they roared defiantly and charged at the Dark Deity lines, even resorting to self-detonation in their final moments of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer horror of the battle was palpable, leaving everyone in the auction hall on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, all 50 thousand members of Pioneers of Starlight fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forty-five thousand were slaughtered outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only around five thousand, now broken and battered, survived, lying on the ground like discarded dogs. Despite their shattered bodies, their eyes still burned with defiance, which infuriated the commander of the Dark Deity Legion. He ordered that they be sent to the auction house to be sold as slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the footage reached its climax, it abruptly cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction hall fell into a stunned silence, the audience reeling from the brutality they had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having never faced the West Zone resistance themselves, those from the Eastern Zone were blissfully unaware of the war's sheer horror and cruelty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone finally broke the silence. "Damn that Human Community resistance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare they defy the esteemed Lord Malevolence's mighty legion! They didn't even surrender! They took down so many of our elite warriors before they fell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All those worthless Human Communities deserve to die!" another voice shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are those humans? I want to buy them and make them suffer every single day! They need to learn the consequences of opposing the esteemed Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! Let's make them pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's torture them to death, then hang their heads on the city gates! Let every lowly Human Community see what happens when they defy the Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was now filled with righteous indignation, their eyes turning cold as they glared at Osborne, the only representative of the Human Community present at the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was as cold as ice; his fists clenched tightly in a mix of heartache and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this is what the West Zone resistance has been enduring! They refuse to surrender, even in death! They won't bow down, not even when captured!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful resolve surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to buy this batch of Human Community prisoners; he could not let them fall into the hands of the other factions, where they would be mocked and humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were true elite warriors of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might perish on the battlefield, but they could never be degraded into slaves, subjected to humiliation and torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buying them back was a necessity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if their bodies were broken and their powers all but lost, they deserved better than the shame of slavery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter the cost, he would do whatever it took to rescue them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the auction crowd was already starting to hurl out bids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go one million and 100 thousand!" shouted a voice from the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One million and 200 thousand!" another called, a bit louder this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One million and 300 thousand!" someone else chimed in, excitement brewing among the bidders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over five thousand Human Community captives on the block, the starting price was shockingly low&mdash;just one million. Their abilities had been stripped away, rendering them nearly useless aside from being objects for torment and degradation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This low starting bid reflected their grim reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While outrage filled the room, the spectators hadn't lost their senses; they recognized these were essentially broken toys&mdash;not worth fetching a high price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After more than twenty rounds of bidding, the price finally crept up to three million.</span></p><div class="pagination">
