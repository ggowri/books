  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of the dungeon, Osborne looked up at Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had video-called Godfather twice before, but this was the first time he had seen him in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he really my grandfather?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes suddenly reddened. His childhood as an orphan had filled him with both longing and unease towards familial love. He was completely unfamiliar with this kind of blood connection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his understanding, familial love didn't originate from blood ties but from emotional bonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like he and Anastasia...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Anastasia weren't related by blood, but he considered her the most important person in his life. They had grown up together, supporting each other through thick and thin. They had rummaged through trash cans together, slept under bridges together, and even fought with stray dogs for food. Anastasia was his emotional anchor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would do anything to save Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The families he acknowledged were those he cared about, not those related to him by blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, as he looked at Godfather, he suddenly felt a blood connection, a familial bond that couldn't be severed no matter what he had been through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was his grandfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's eyes reddened. He desperately wanted to leave the dungeon and rush up to meet Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, Osborne calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Everett Rosenthal arrived, his powerful aura shocking Osborne to the core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The head of the Rosenthal family, the most potent divine descendant family in Yalynch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Class S Supreme Overlord?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two divine artifacts as a wager?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godsons?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched the events unfold above, utterly astonished. He hadn't expected such an unexpected turn of events at Godfather's 80th birthday celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder Godfather chose to hold his birthday banquet at Arena Number One. He must have foreseen this and made preparations in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But can the Augustine family win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze fixed on the six Godsons from Yalynch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of the six Godsons had a Victory Sword emblem on their sleeve, two silver and four bronze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Lance, Yalynch's younger generation had only twenty Godsons, who were carefully selected as the most influential individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silver Sword of Victory emblem signified they were among the top ten Godsons in Yalynch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bronze Sword of Victory emblem meant they were among the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be ranked in the top twenty among countless young powerhouses in a nation was terrifying, their strength undoubtedly formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their realms had all reached Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the Augustine family members who were about to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, Emma, Lance, and Sam had also reached Class AA. They were the only four individuals under the age of thirty-five in the Augustine family to have achieved this level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could they win?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't optimistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosmandi didn't have a Godson selection process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne didn't know how the four would rank among the younger generation in Rosmandi. Rosmandi was too vast, with numerous ancient families. Although the Augustine family claimed to be the oldest in Rosmandi, other ancient families could rival them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, there were quite a few such families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Godfather's existence, the Augustine family wouldn't necessarily be the top ancient family in Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Rosmandi's younger generation were to compete and select the top twenty as Godsons, Osborne believes the four might not cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, due to the country's size, Rosmandi's Godsons would be more potent than Yalynch's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne still isn't optimistic about Owen and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they lose, Godfather will lose Everett and two divine artifacts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Godfather and found him calm, his thoughts unreadable. But for some reason, Osborne didn't want Godfather to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was imprisoned in the dungeon. If it weren't for Satan's Eye breaking through, he wouldn't even know what was happening above, let alone intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only silently watch the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the first fight was about to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen confidently issued a challenge, causing Yalynch's six Godsons to chuckle. They exchanged glances, and a man in his thirties slowly stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his sleeve was embroidered a silver Sword of Victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly walked to Owen's opposite side, calmly stating, "My name is Gordon Rosenthal. I am ranked tenth among the Godsons of Yalynch. I am your opponent, and I will defeat you within ten moves. Now, make your move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Gordon finished speaking, Owen's face immediately changed, his eyes filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How arrogant! Defeat me within ten moves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are? Remember this, this is Rosmandi, not your Yalynch. Even if you are the tenth-ranked Godson of Yalynch, you're nothing here in Rosmandi. I, representing the Augustine family of Rosmandi, will easily defeat you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon smiled faintly. "The people of the Augustine family of Rosmandi are still as good at boasting as ever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk, let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's aura exploded as he beckoned Owen forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll soon find out if I'm boasting or not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Owen no longer hesitated and instantly made his move.</span></p><div class="pagination">
