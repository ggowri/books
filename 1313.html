  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence was brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's tactics, in his eyes, were indeed perplexing. Were his opponents not of equal or higher standing, they would likely be powerless against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence even believed that Osborne could dispatch a Transcendent Deity warrior with greater ease than he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tragically, for Osborne, Terrence was simply stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's methods, though formidable, were manageable and even restrained by Terrence. The balance of power was decisively tipped in Terrence's favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Terrence's view, any hope of Osborne overcoming him was nothing short of a fantasy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a breakthrough to the Superior Deity realm stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne himself was muttering under his breath, "To defeat Terrence, it seems I must attain Superior Deity status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrence's strength far outstrips that of an ordinary Transcendent Deity warrior. My tactics, shattered and suppressed, offer no viable options against him. The only path left is a risky trade of injuries, relying on the regenerative, even revivifying prowess of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to outlast him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, Osborne shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Revealing the resurrection capabilities of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was a risk he was unwilling to take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his belief in Divine Shadow and God of Star's trustworthiness, the Cosmic Treasure's allure was simply too potent, even for Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dared not gamble with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne's sole path to triumph over Terrence lay in reaching the Superior Deity realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For others, the leap from Intermediate Deity to Superior Deity was arduously slow, requiring immense time and energy painstakingly absorbed and refined from the environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, this was far simpler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need to arduously draw energy from his surroundings; the energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would suffice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With its advanced essence, Osborne required no further refinement. Simply absorbing the requisite energy from the Lotus would rightfully elevate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, even Osborne needed time to make this ascension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantaneous progression was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had another ace up his sleeve, a method to momentarily reach the Superior Deity level, if not Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept onto Osborne's face. "Terrence, you believe you've already won? You're counting your chickens before they hatch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence frowned at the provocation. "</span><span>D</span><span>o you have any tricks left? Lay them bare, but unless you can instantly ascend to Superior Deity, you stand no hope against me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow and God of Star, seeing the situation clearly, nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was undeniably powerful, but the gap to overpower Terrence was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any victory would require Osborne's further enhancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he only stood at the Intermediate Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instantaneous breakthrough to Superior Deity? That's impossible," Divine Shadow sighed, resigned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, "Instant Superior Deity, you say? Well, stranger things have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch closely, for the impossible shall now unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Superior Deity level, here I come! Break through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his proclamation, Osborne's divine power surged violently. His energy aura rapidly intensified, akin to a volcanic eruption, growing stronger and more potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present could clearly sense the swelling power in Osborne, the rapid ascent from Intermediate Deity toward Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, too, were Divine Shadow and God of Star, their gazes locked upon Osborne in utter astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some kind of secret technique to unlock potential and boost power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's face was etched with grim determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suspected that Osborne's rapid surge in power was due to a forbidden technique&mdash;one that tapped into, or even drained, potential for a temporary surge in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Techniques like that usually came with a heavy price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence mused, "Is he really willing to go so far just to take me down? Tch, even if that's the case, there's no way I'm going down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as I live, the Deschanel Clan lives on. And as long as I live, there'll be a day for revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I get the chance, I need to capture him alive. If I hold him hostage, I can get out of here in one piece. Then, I'll vanish into Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to Terrence, the members of the Blood Demon squad surrounding him were swiftly losing their vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all temporarily lent their strength to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them carried the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity embedded within their bodies&mdash;a curse that granted them immortality but at a cost. Through those same roots, Osborne could siphon a portion of their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over four thousand eight hundred Blood Demon members contributing, even just fragments of their strength were enough to send Osborne's power skyrocketing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's aura surged violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power broke through the ceiling, shattering the boundaries of an Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was now temporarily a Superior Deity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
