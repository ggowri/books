  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the three Transcendent Deity warriors of the Deschanel Clan found themselves cornered by the God of Star and Divine Shadow. Their situation was dire, leaving them no time to pay attention to the battle unfolding below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were anxiously waiting for the twelve Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan to finish off the Augustine family and come to their aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twelve Superior Deities constituted a formidable force; teamed with these three, they could definitely turn the tide in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon mused, "Damn it! What's taking those useless idiots so long? Twelve Superior Deities should have no problem wiping out over a hundred Junior Deities from the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is it taking them so long?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon seethed, his frustration boiling over. Just then, he sensed someone approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face lit up with hope because he thought it was the Deschanel Clan's Superior Deities finally coming to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced over, only to freeze in disbelief. It wasn't the Superior Deities he was expecting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star and Divine Shadow also noticed Osborne's arrival, their expressions brightening with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Divine Shadow transformed from a cat into a stunning woman in her twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you finally made it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's your grandpa?" she asked, urgency lacing her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile at her concern. "Don't worry, Grandma Divine Shadow! Grandpa is fine. He just overexerted himself and got a little banged up. I've already sent him back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow let out a sigh of relief, her earlier worry melting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they're alright, then you need to get out of here! We can handle these three! </span><span>They're all Transcendent Deities; you can't take them on alone. You need to leave before you get hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star chimed in, "Osborne, go take care of the battle below. We've got this covered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for that. The battle below is already settled! I took care of all twelve Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His statement brought an eerie silence to the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow, God of Star, and even Eamon and his companions were momentarily stunned, looking at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's face darkened, and he growled, "What did you just say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed all twelve Superior Deities from my clan? No way! You think you could take them down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to mess with our heads?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's icy glare was fixed on Osborne. If it weren't for Divine Shadow and God of Star standing in his way, he would have loved nothing more than to slap Osborne into oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, unfazed. "Believe it or not, that's your problem. The twelve Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan are indeed gone, and I came here to take you out next!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had the audacity to attack the Augustine family, and now you're all going down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan will be wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each step, he advanced toward Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma Divine Shadow, God of Star, can I take this guy on? I want to see just how strong a Transcendent Deity warrior really is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow and God of Star exchanged stunned glances, taken aback by his boldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious about challenging him one-on-one? Osborne, have you lost your mind? What level are you even at? Just a few days ago, you were still a Junior Deity!" Divine Shadow </span><span>exclaimed,</span><span> her voice filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up to check Osborne's Divine Flame, only to find it was completely gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow understood better than anyone what it meant to lack the Divine Flame above one's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've mastered Level One of the Eclipsing Mantra?" she gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it was pretty easy! I didn't even have time to train in the Eclipsing Mantra lately; otherwise, I would've probably mastered Level Two by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow was utterly stunned, her mouth agape as she stared at Osborne, as if he were some </span><span>kind</span><span> of monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Easy? The Eclipsing Mantra is easy for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've spent hundreds of years trying to grasp it, and I'm still stuck at Level One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took me thirty years just to master that level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he's done it in a matter of days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down her spine as she fell silent, grappling with the implications of his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware of her inner turmoil, Osborne continued to think of the Eclipsing Mantra as a walk in the park. To him, Level One was practically a cakewalk; he'd succeeded just by giving it a casual shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Two felt a bit tougher, but Osborne was confident that if he had a little more time, he could nail it within a few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shifted the conversation, looking at Divine Shadow and God of Star. "Grandma Divine Shadow, God of Star, I just want to test my strength against a Transcendent Deity and see how far off I really am. You don't need to worry; even if I can't take him down, there's no way he can kill me! I'm sure of that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His determination was palpable, but both Divine Shadow and God of Star exchanged worried glances, their brows furrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, they finally nodded, albeit reluctantly. "Alright, give it a shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Divine Shadow added, "Just don't be reckless. If you can't handle it, don't hesitate to bail out!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
