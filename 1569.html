  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The screams of Ingemar and the others echoed for a full ten minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When silence finally fell, their gazes had shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The disdain and contempt they once held for Osborne had vanished, replaced by fervent admiration and respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In unison, they bowed deeply, calling out, "We greet you, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved a hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stand up! From now on, let's keep things a bit more low-key. Don't call me 'my Lord' in front of outsiders&mdash;just Mr. Augustine will do. You were one way before, and I expect you to stay that way. Don't let anyone catch on to your changes, got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, sir!" they replied in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity extended into their bodies, allowing Osborne to issue commands silently and effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ingemar Harrison, Robin Bulwer, Maud Pitman... you'll be the squad leaders for my team. Organize your members as you see fit, but mix the veterans with the newcomers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's first command was met with immediate compliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They quickly divided into ten squads, each blending seasoned veterans with fresh recruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under normal circumstances, these groups would have never worked together, as they often looked down on one another. But now, transformed into Blood Clan members, they followed Osborne's orders without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After reviewing the squad arrangements, Osborne felt a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally, I have a solid hundred-man team! Now, I just need to get selected to support Divine Peak Nine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then reminded the group once more of their tasks before activating the divine power barrier and stepping out of the training room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside, a crowd had gathered, their curiosity palpable. They were eager to learn the outcome of the showdown between Osborne and Ingemar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the door swung open, their eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was still standing, and Ingemar and the others were following him obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Did Osborne actually win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ingemar is a genius from the Soaring Lion Clan's Harrison family! He's willingly walking behind Osborne? This clearly means he lost! Did he really accept defeat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd buzzed with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some who knew Ingemar couldn't help but ask about the outcome, but Ingemar shot them a cold glare and replied icily, "What's it to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he stormed off, leaving the onlookers even more astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their suspicions were confirmed&mdash;Ingemar and his group had indeed lost, and the news quickly spread, putting Osborne's name on everyone's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne paid no mind to the gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Osborne won? Ingemar is actually following him around and seems to be obeying orders? Are those lazy old-timers doing the same?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno was stunned when he heard the news. His expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This guy has managed to earn the respect of those deadbeats? Even Ingemar is taking orders from him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's got some serious skills!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If he continues to grow like this, he could rise through the ranks in the Wild Flame Army and earn a chiliarch title without breaking a sweat. One day, he might even surpass me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But too bad for him&mdash;he won't get the chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tomorrow is his last day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno muttered to himself, plotting how to lure Osborne to a secluded spot in the wilderness for an ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As time passed, another day rolled around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early in the morning, Bruno anxiously stood outside Osborne's stone house, waiting for his chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno's face was alight with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for Osborne to respond, he plunged right into it. "Osborne, this is it! You've got a chance to shine! I just got word that there's a cluster of Deathborn near No. 7 mining area, and they've already taken out quite a few miners! There might even be a few Celestial Deity-level Deathborn among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In Wild Flame City, Celestial Deity Deathborn aren't something you see every day. Whenever one pops up, everyone scrambles to deal with it because taking one down nets a third-class merit&mdash;quite a feather in your cap! If you can handle this Deathborn cluster solo, you'll earn yourself personal third-class merit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With that, Mr. Guy Borden can promote you to chiliarch! Osborne, let's move before anyone else catches wind of this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry&mdash;I'll help you out, just like Mr. Guy Borden instructed me to, but I won't steal your glory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on, we need to get going before someone else swoops in and grabs the credit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno finished his speech, practically dragging Osborne out of the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold smile crept across Osborne's face as he thought, "Finally, they're getting into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Let's see if you're the ones setting a trap for me or if I'm the one who will deal with you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bruno, I really appreciate this! You're willing to let me take this opportunity? I'll definitely make it up to you later! But right now, we need to hurry before someone else snatches our chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, the two of them burst out of the outpost.</span></p><div class="pagination">
