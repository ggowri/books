  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression suddenly changed. This strange attack left him with no idea how to defend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolf's claws tore through Osborne's martial art aura, leaving gashes on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan's massive fist slammed down in front of Osborne. He barely raised his arm to block but was sent flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat out a mouthful of blood. His face looked grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood he spat out was instantly drawn to Vampire in the distance, appearing in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grasped Osborne's blood. A cold smile appeared on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flame rose up, scorching Osborne's blood. At the same time, a searing flame </span><span>enveloped Osborne, burning his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly felt like his body was about to catch fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scorch marks quickly appeared on the surface of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth. He used the martial art aura to protect himself, trying to fend off the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized the flames were burning from within his blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of strange trick is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Controlling my blood? Attacking my blood can hurt my actual body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire's bizarre methods made Osborne's already tough situation even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, even if Werewolf and Titan couldn't kill him, Vampire would burn him alive until his blood dried up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't go on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was sent flying again by Titan. His injuries worsened. Even with his recovery abilities, he couldn't keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wondered whether he should use the Light of Redemption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he activated the Light of Redemption, all his negative statuses, injuries, and drained energy would instantly recover. He'd be back at his peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After using the Light of Redemption, he wouldn't be able to use it again for at least half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't dare to use it lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems I have no choice. I hope this works!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glared at Vampire in the distance. He snorted coldly and activated the power of the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vampires!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transform!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Vampire? Perfect. I can transform into a Vampire, too! Do you want to control my blood? Let's see if you can handle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered. His body quickly began to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just the blink of an eye, Osborne completed his vampire transformation. His hair turned blood-red. Sharp teeth and claws appeared, along with a pale, chiseled face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Osborne felt a powerful surge of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strange flames inside his body were extinguished instantly. His previously agitated blood stabilized, no longer affected by Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even faintly sensed Vampire's blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That blood seemed delicious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That blood seemed like it could be controlled, as long as he willed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glared at Vampire. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire was stunned as he looked at Osborne's transformed state. His face showed a mix of shock, fear, and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he sensed the presence of a higher-level Vampire ancestor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, this isn't possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire growled. He felt an urge to kneel. Only his higher cultivation level allowed him to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was thrown into disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even dare to attack Osborne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's start by taking you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glared at </span><span>Vampire,</span><span> his face icy. The blood in his body surged rapidly as if enraged that Vampire wasn't kneeling before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne extended his cold hand and reached for Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire let out a scream instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood in his body gushed out like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me! Help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire felt the presence of death. He shouted in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa, Titan, and Werewolf heard his cries. Their expression changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't understand why such a strange thing was happening. They could only attack Osborne desperately to stop him from harming Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang, bang, bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used the martial art aura to defend. It was under immense pressure, shaking wildly. However, it was still shattered, leaving more injuries on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's petrification spread quickly, threatening to turn Osborne entirely to stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't retreat. This was his best chance to kill Vampire. If he missed it, Vampire would be on guard, and he might not get another chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get over here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne roared angrily. Vampire's blood spurted out even more violently, forming a bloodline that Osborne grabbed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
