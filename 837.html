  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression turned serious. "Tell me everything you know."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group quickly relayed the situation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had already checked the surveillance footage. After Yulissa and Kendra entered Arena Number One, they simply vanished.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one suspicious had left the area either.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They searched the entire ring but found no signs of a struggle.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think they've already been dealt with? Maybe someone got rid of the evidence and torched everything, which is why we can't find anything?" Nathan asked anxiously.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop jumping to conclusions," Osborne interrupted with a shake of his head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's way too early to be saying that. I'll take a look myself. In the meantime, keep searching. Check for hidden passages or anything that might've let them sneak out."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group nodded and split up to continue their search.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, a power that gave him a detailed view of everything around Arena Number One. He carefully scanned the surrounding rocks, hoping to find any hidden entrances or tunnels.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the result was disappointing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not a single secret tunnel or hidden exit, even the rocks above the arena were completely solid.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This doesn't make sense. How did they disappear without a trace?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If there's no secret passage, did they... somehow go underground?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That thought sparked something in Osborne's mind.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Arena Number One was directly above the Augustine family's dungeon. He remembered being locked up there when the Rosenthal family came to challenge the Augustine family, and how he had used his Satan's Eye to spy on this exact area.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could they have gone into the dungeon?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly scanned the ground beneath Arena Number One but still found no sign of a way down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet something deep inside him told him that if Yulissa and Kendra were still alive, they had to be in that dungeon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to check the dungeon," Osborne announced to Caleb.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb looked stunned. "The dungeon? How could they possibly get in there? It's protected by some kind of invisible force. Even if they could go underground, there's no way they'd make it past that."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm just guessing," Osborne shrugged. "But I won't know until I check. We're not finding anything up here anyway, so I might as well take a look."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, here's the key," Caleb said, handing it over.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the key in hand, Osborne left Arena Number One and headed to the dungeon's entrance. He unlocked the door and stepped into the dark, narrow passage that led to the dungeon itself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment he entered, it was just as he remembered, silent, cold, and completely lifeless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For anyone else, this place would be unbearable. The darkness would blind them, and the strange atmosphere would crush their senses. Even worse, the dungeon was constantly assaulting anyone inside with mental attacks. It was a place designed to break the will of any intruder.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne was different.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thanks to the soul shield technique he'd learned from Isa, the Psychic Blast had no effect on him. He could even sense faint traces of star power in this eerie place.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And with his Satan's Eye, he could see everything clearly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne combed through the dungeon, trying to find any trace of Kendra and Yulissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after a thorough search, his hopes faded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not a single clue that either of them had been here.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Frustration gnawed at him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not here either?" he muttered under his breath, feeling a surge of guilt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kendra was the sister of Bryce, the man who had once saved Osborne's life. Bryce had personally asked him to look after her, but with everything going on, he had let that slip through the cracks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now she was missing, and Osborne couldn't bear the thought of facing Bryce without answers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Yulissa had lived under the same roof with him for so long, and despite the complicated relationship, she had become someone he cared about.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The idea of something happening to her gnawed at him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clenching his teeth, he turned to leave the dungeon and head back to Challenge Peak to continue his search.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Help... help me..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a faint, desperate voice echoed through the cold walls.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne froze, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the dimly lit dungeon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who's there? Who's calling for help?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's me..." The voice was weak and hoarse, barely holding on.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne... please... save me..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's heart skipped a beat. "You... know who I am?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course I do. We spoke the last time you were locked up here. As for who I am... I'm an ancient god, God of Star. Though my real body has long since faded, all that's left of me now is a fragment of my essence."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"God of Star?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"An ancient god?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And we talked before?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes widened in shock. "This isn't some kind of trick, is it?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have no reason to lie to you, and honestly, I wouldn't dare," the voice said, carrying an air of exhaustion. "After all, you are... well, let's just say I have every reason to be honest with you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood there, stunned by what he was hearing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After taking a deep breath to calm himself, he asked, "Where are you?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And, have you seen two young women, around their twenties, pass through here recently?"</p><div class="pagination">
