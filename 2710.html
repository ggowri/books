  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Four figures suddenly appeared in the secret base of the Fairy Moon Sect deep beneath the desolate western region of Evernight Court. They were Osborne, Isa, Clarissa, and Kendra, who had rushed back from Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Adriana, Emma, and the others emerged from their seclusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana asked worriedly, "Osborne, I heard something happened to Alfreda. How is she?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's stabilized!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne explained Alfreda's condition and then had everyone enter the Dimensional Microcosm to see her for themselves, which finally put them at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't believe such an accident happened. If I had known earlier, I would have personally accompanied Alfreda."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was a bit annoyed at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head and said, "This has nothing to do with you! How's your progress these days? Why do I feel like you haven't improved much?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana replied, "My cultivation level is already at Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. How could I possibly have significant improvement? But don't worry. I've already touched the bottleneck to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, reaching the same level as Emperor Frederick!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll handle him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her confidence, Osborne finally nodded. "This is our only chance. We must either kill or capture Emperor Frederick alive! With Alfreda's condition, she can only hold on for ten years. I don't have much time to waste on Emperor Frederick!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So this time, we must take him down!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded firmly, then frowned and said, "But there's still a gap in strength between us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sighed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spent three days earlier controlling eighteen Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, bringing the number of warriors at this cultivation level to twenty-two.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Frederick still has thirty-two such warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, Osborne could have continued taking action. He was confident in controlling more Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, completely reversing the number of warriors on both sides.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Alfreda had an incident in Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To save her, Osborne spent a day there. Although there is still some time before Frederick arrives, Osborne can no longer take action because the Domain Suppression Stele is no longer usable!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It must stay by Alfreda's side from now on to suppress the essence draining from the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the Domain Suppression Stele, Osborne cannot silently defeat those prey and take control of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although I can't control them, I can still...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hunt!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Adriana, Isa, Clarissa, you all continue your seclusion! Emperor Frederick will take at least another day to arrive! During this time, I'll kill a few more of them to narrow the power gap between us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze turned icy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also needed to vent at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda was in trouble again. The endless anger he had suppressed felt like a heavy stone pressing on his heart, making him extremely stifled and in need of someone to vent it on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa opened her mouth, seemingly wanting to say something, but ultimately she gave up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She simply said, "Be careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Isa went back to seclusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was also very upset. Osborne had tasked her with protecting Alfreda back to Elf City, but Alfreda got into trouble. Isa blamed herself, thinking it was because she wasn't strong enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she were strong enough to stop Naomi, Alfreda wouldn't have gotten into trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda was so good to her, but she couldn't protect Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Isa was desperately yearning for greater power at this moment, determined to improve her cultivation level and strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa also went into seclusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After reminding Osborne to be careful, Adriana, Emma, Austin, Anastasia, and the others also went back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Osborne and Kendra were left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kendra, let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and Kendra set out once again. This time, they weren't sneaking around to capture and control prey&mdash;they were out for the kill!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick still had thirty-two Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, including Callista and Quinn. Their strength was still greater than Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the final battle, while they were still acting separately, Osborne planned to hunt down a few of them to narrow the gap between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, this way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The aura of Prince Quinn you're looking for is not far in this direction! But there are two others with him. Altogether, there are three Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne squinted his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needed to vent this time, and the best targets were naturally his enemies, like Callista and Quinn, so he had Kendra track them down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, Quinn is nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors? That's a bit troublesome! But this time, I won't back down; I'll take them all down together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face was cold as he directed the Ascending Sacred Sanctum toward Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Quinn was swiftly flying through the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up! My father wants us to gather. He must be planning to track down those Fairy Moon Sect bastards!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now that Weston is in trouble, I am the most outstanding prince in the Royal Family! As long as I perform well this time, my father will definitely be impressed by me! In the future, I will become the emperor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn was very excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they besieged the Fairy Moon Sect, Osborne shot Weston with an arrow, severely injuring him and directly abducting him. Everyone else was terrified, but Quinn was overjoyed because Weston was his biggest rival.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There will only be one emperor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and Weston&rsquo;s strength and abilities have always surpassed Quinn&rsquo;s. Under normal circumstances, it would be hard for him to defeat Weston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Weston is in trouble!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn desperately hoped that Osborne would kill Weston, so no one would compete with him for the throne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quinn urged the two behind him. They were also warriors of the Royal Family, but their cultivation level was Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, so they were slightly slower compared to him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a massive light sphere suddenly appeared around the three of them, approaching quickly. As Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, they never imagined anyone would dare to ambush them. Caught off guard, they were instantly trapped inside the enormous light sphere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this was precisely Osborne using the Supreme Sacred Artifact Invictus Seal to unleash the Invictus Field!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne appeared inside the light sphere with a grim expression, coldly staring at Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you? Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Quinn panicked. Especially when he saw Osborne holding the Apocalypse Bow, his face turned pale, and he quickly hid behind the other two Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but sneer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prince Quinn, long time no see!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a serious expression, Quinn asked, "Osborne, you're still not running away? How dare you show up in front of me! Let me tell you, I've already contacted my father. He'll be here soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, even if you want to run, you won't be able to!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed, "Don't worry! Before Emperor Frederick arrives, I can take care of you! Are you ready to face my revenge?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn became more terrified, but he forced himself to stay calm and shouted, "Osborne, how dare you! You can only shoot one arrow, but there are three of us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you can't kill us all with one arrow, you're doomed!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
