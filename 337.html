  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia looked at Evelyn with slightly bloodshot eyes and shivered, looking like she was on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn wanted to say something but didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Yulissa and Kendra beside Osborne, even she was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two girls were young and beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn didn't know them, but judging from their temperaments, she knew that they were not ordinary people and definitely came from wealthy families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the two girls, what advantages did Ophelia have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No! Ophelia was&nbsp;nothing compared to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn felt a little regretful. She regretted coming to Dampston with Ophelia and boarding the Augustine family's ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had noticed her and Ophelia, but he was indifferent as if he didn't know them, which made Evelyn regret it even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Evelyn sighed and put her arm around Ophelia's shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Ophelia, don't give up. You are not without advantages. You and Osborne once had real feelings for each other. Osborne loved you deeply before. I can see that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although you have done some wrong things over the years and harmed him, I believe that you still have a position in his heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stopped shaking after hearing Evelyn's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were full of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "Evelyn, really? Do you really feel that way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn hesitated for a moment but finally nodded. "Of course. I won't lie to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn didn't want to lie to Ophelia anymore, but she knew that if she didn't say that, Ophelia would probably collapse on the spot. She could only continue to give Ophelia hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this hope would probably hurt Ophelia and bring her greater despair in the future, she had to let Ophelia get through today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Expectation flickered in Ophelia's eyes. She hesitated for a moment and suddenly stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, where are you going?" Evelyn was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia said firmly, "I'm going to find Osborne and apologize to him. I want him to come back to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Evelyn quickly stopped her. "Ophelia, don't be impulsive. It is not a good time to do that. Osborne has two beautiful girls by his side. Even if you apologize to him now, he may not forgive you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Men are stubborn. In front of others, Osborne will definitely treat you coldly. Don't worry. You should find a time to be alone with him and then apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia hesitated for a moment and finally sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still stared at Osborne and bit her lower lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne sat down, Yulissa and Kendra finally let go of his arms. They sat on both sides of him closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra raised her hand, and the waiter began to serve the dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made these dishes herself in the restaurant's kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a bite and was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Kendra and thought, "This girl is not just beautiful. She actually has top-notch cooking skills."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa couldn't help but feel amazed after eating the dishes. She didn't embarrass Kendra anymore, and the atmosphere between them eased a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are the two women over there staring at you, Osborne?" Yulissa suddenly asked in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sat with his back to Ophelia and Evelyn. Yulissa tilted her head and saw two women staring at Osborne. She immediately frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew she was talking about Ophelia and Evelyn. He didn't turn around but just said calmly, "Just ignore them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." Yulissa nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the meal, Osborne left the restaurant with Yulissa and Kendra, not glancing at Ophelia and Evelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, they were even worse than strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to the room, Osborne locked the door and started practicing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, it was night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne absorbed another blood diamond. Every cell in his body was full of strength, and a faint red glow enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It's much easier for a martial artist to break through Class A than for a metahuman, but it's very dangerous. If I'm not careful, my body will shatter like glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I must accumulate enough power to break through Class A in one fell swoop. If I fail, even if I don't die, I will never be able to break through it in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne vaguely felt that he was on the verge of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted, he could break through Class A immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't do that. Instead, he tried hard to suppress the feeling of a breakthrough. He had to absorb more blood diamonds to make his body's foundation stronger so that he could break through in one fell swoop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, the success rate would be higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength after the breakthrough could be even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rested for a while and immediately began to absorb blood diamonds again. In the past few days, he had absorbed three blood diamonds, and there were 25 blood diamonds left, which were enough for him to use for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, they were enough for him to improve his physical quality and power to Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, it was early morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people on the ship had fallen asleep. Yulissa, in the next room, had also finished her practice. She washed up and went to bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye suddenly started pulsing wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's coming!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
