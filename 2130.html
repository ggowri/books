  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared in disbelief, his surprise quickly flipping to elation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Satan's Eye possessed this incredible ability! The ocular energy it released had consumed the Sacred Crystals directly! At this moment, over fifty thousand Sacred Crystals appeared within the confines of his Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Now I get it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To break through to the Sacredness Level, Satan's Eye has fused with the Infinite </span><span>Devouring Eyes! Now it can devour anything, breaking it down into energy to enhance my cultivation level! And that ocular energy serves as the medium for its absorption...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anything enveloped by the ocular energy of Satan's Eye can be consumed, drawn into its internal space..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With newfound understanding, Osborne decided to test this further. He focused again, summoning a slick wave of ocular energy from Satan's Eye that enveloped a floating rock over 60 miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thought, that rock vanished. Meanwhile, the rock appeared in the inner space of the Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's incredible!" Osborne's heart raced as he realized the full potential of this ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, he had been stumped about how to extract the Sacred Crystals from the vein, but now, Satan's Eye had unveiled a solution he hadn't anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this power, who could ever contest me for treasures again? I just need to activate Satan's Eye&mdash;envelop any item with the ocular energy and </span><span>it's</span><span> mine, just like that... even..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze darted to Alfreda, not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held her magnificent Arcane Staff of Nature, an Apex divine artifact, tightly in her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne unleashed another surge of pale purple ocular energy, instantly shrouding the Arcane Staff of Nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, it vanished from her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda jolted awake, confusion pooling in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What just happened?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's my Arcane Staff of Nature?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who stole my Arcane Staff?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She started to panic, searching frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled softly to himself, keenly aware of the Arcane Staff now resting inside his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely fantastic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giving it a try, he focused on engulfing Alfreda as well, but Satan's Eye remained still, betraying no signs of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like I can't devour living beings," Osborne muttered to himself, recognizing the limitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he decided to return the staff to her. With a flick of his thoughts, the Arcane Staff of Nature reappeared in Alfreda's grasp as if it had never left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda gasped upon seeing her staff materialize. She leaped to her feet, bewildered, her eyes wide as she glanced around for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then her eyes met Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that electric moment, a shiver ran through her, and she quickly looked away, her heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ethereal glow emanating from Osborne's Satan's Eye filled her with an unfamiliar </span><span>dread, as if he had peered straight into her soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like staring into an abyss, one capable of consuming everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, she finally gathered herself and looked back up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her relief, the unsettling glow had faded, and Osborne's eyes were back to normal, though she was still far from steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what just happened? Your eyes... they seemed different!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, a hint of pride glinting in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are indeed a bit different, thanks to my recent breakthrough! I was just testing a new ability..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was cut off by a sudden thrill running through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough chit-chat! I'm gearing up for a major cultivation breakthrough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne settled into a meditative stance, ready to embrace the surge of power that awaited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, Osborne felt a surge within him, a loosening of his cultivation level that propelled him from Ascension Two toward a rapid breakthrough into Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The speed at which Satan's Eye can now decompose energy has increased at least a hundredfold! Back when I was using the Infinite Devouring Eyes, it took three days to break down the energy from just one Sacred Crystal. But now, with the Sacredness Level Satan's Eye, I can do it in half an hour! I was expecting to take days to reach Ascension Three, but suddenly, here I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joy bubbled up inside him as he reveled in this newfound power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his divine power expanded wildly, reaching a threshold before swiftly stabilizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Three Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes, excitement flickering deep within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I finally made it to Ascension Three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up, stretching his limbs and savoring the rush of strength coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I was at the Ascension Two level, defeating Alfreda was a real challenge. I had to pull out all the stops, even resorting to my ultimate technique just to force her to concede. However, now, it'll be a piece of cake for me to beat Alfreda. Even when facing an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, I'm pretty confident I can go head-to-head with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a glance at Alfreda, who was watching him with a mix of envy and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Back when I was Ascension Two, I couldn't hold a candle to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, just a few days later, he's already hit Ascension Three?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of monster is he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before we entered Umbra Earth, he was still at Ascension One, and now, after just over twenty days here, he's skyrocketed to Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this even human?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've never seen anyone break through two cultivation levels in such a short time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you secretly munch on some Sacred Elixir or something?" Alfreda's voice was </span><span>laced with a hint of playful accusation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that only some highly potent Sacred Elixirs could have enabled Osborne to break through two cultivation levels in such a short period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed, shaking his head. "Nope! I've had my fair share of gains since stepping into this Umbra Earth, but I haven't come across any Sacred Elixirs yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda sighed dramatically, "Then you really are a monster!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this rate, you'll be catching up to me in no time! Ugh, being around someone like you really does a number on my confidence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chuckled, adding, "Thank goodness we're friends and not rivals! Otherwise, I'd be losing sleep over this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached into his Dimensional Bag and handed it to her. "My Spatial Clone had quite the haul! I gathered around two thousand Azure Ores, and per our agreement, you get a tenth of it.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hundred Azure Ores are all yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda took the Dimensional Bag, but before she could open it, she heard his words and froze. "How many?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two thousand Azure Ores?!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did your clones wipe out all the Mud Golems in the Corrosive Marsh or something? How else could you have gotten that many Azure Ores?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even just a tenth meant two hundred Azure Ores&mdash;more than enough for her to enhance the Arcane Staff of Nature into a top-tier Apex divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that kind of upgrade, her power would undoubtedly soar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne? He would be left with a staggering eighteen hundred Azure Ores. With that many, he might actually have the chance to transform his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow into a Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entire Elf City, which had been developing for over a hundred thousand years in deep space, there were only a handful of such artifacts&mdash;barely enough to count on one hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne might be on the verge of possessing one himself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda looked at him with pure envy, her eyes sparkling with admiration.</span></p><div class="pagination">
