  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spat out a mouthful of blood and felt much better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his soul and spirit were almost cut apart by the Death Sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even react at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, at a crucial moment, Satan's Eye did not let him down. A cool power surged from it, stabilizing his soul and spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, that cool power quickly repaired the injuries to his soul and spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few breaths, the damage to his soul and spirit was nearly restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne had spat blood, his condition was actually unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Satan's Eye can actually repair injuries to the soul and spirit? It seems to be the power of the soul of powers. Isa compressed my soul of powers and eventually became an eyeball, merging with my Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary Satan's Eye should not be able to repair such injuries to the soul. Otherwise, Chris would definitely not be so confident in his ability to kill me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This power must be unique to the fusion of the soul of powers and Satan's Eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne sighed in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most terrifying aspect of Chris is his mental attacks unleashed through the Death Sickle. Even Serena could only withstand three hits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, with Satan's Eye capable of repairing injuries to the soul and spirit, I'm no longer afraid of Chris."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne secretly felt pleased but pretended to look weak, as if he had already been injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Chris was a </span><span>top Class AA</span><span> expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne could restrain him, it would not be easy to win or kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne had to disguise himself as wounded to make Chris lower his guard, allowing him to strike Chris decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne spat out another mouthful of blood, making his face even paler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a strange way of mental attack,"&nbsp;Osborne said loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris did not attack immediately, as such an attack was not easy for him either. It required some time to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Osborne with a cold smile and scoffed,&nbsp;"You disappointed me. I thought you could perform better, but after just one attack, you are barely holding on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that won't be any fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted,&nbsp;"Arrogant. Even if you can kill me, I will still bite off a piece of your flesh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took the initiative to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used a dimensional rift to appear behind Chris in an instant, throwing a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He utilized proficiency-level Spiral Force combined with his immense strength, </span><span>creating a terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Shawn, Yaron, nor Emery could withstand his punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chris was not like them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the spatial fluctuations in an instant, Chris swung the Death Sickle behind him to collide with Osborne's fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a dull sound, Osborne felt his strength seem to sink into a swamp, completely dissipated. The vibrating Death Sickle unexpectedly unleashed another mental attack, tearing at his soul and spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Satan's Eye quickly repaired those tears, they still made Osborne feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought for a moment and spat out another mouthful of blood, pretending to look even weaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne spit blood, Chris became more arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a laughable attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You managed to refine your Spiral Force to proficiency level, which is not bad. But I happened to refine Stretch Soft Force. Your Spiral Force lacks penetrating power and can't hurt me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And how many more of my mental attacks can you withstand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Chris swung the Death Sickle again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another impact tore at his soul, which Satan's Eye again repaired. Osborne feigned, spitting blood again, his face now as pale as paper, his body starting to sway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to have lost the ability to counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris, however, felt disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that this is all you can do. Now I should send you on your way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Chris swung the Death Sickle once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris unleashed a third mental attack, again slicing at Osborne's soul and spirit. After Osborne spat out another mouthful of blood, his body swayed, and he knelt down. His head drooped, seemingly unable to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris wore a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly walked toward Osborne and said calmly,&nbsp;"Is this all you can endure? I am a bit disappointed. But after all, you are only Class A. Being able to withstand three of my attacks is already quite impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, even Serena could only take three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I will be cutting off your head to take back with me. Perhaps I can give it to the Godfather? It would be a nice surprise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jokingly, Chris had already approached Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly raised the Death Sickle, but this time, there was no strange black energy on it, just like an ordinary sharp sickle. It swiftly swung down toward Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris did not notice that, with his head lowered, Osborne's eyes shone with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now's the time for you to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne abruptly raised his head. The cold light from Satan's Eye erupted, projecting an illusion into Chris's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne unleashed all his strength and threw a punch at Chris's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this punch, he infused Point Blank Force.</span></p><div class="pagination">
