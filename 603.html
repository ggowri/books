  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was waiting at Godfather's birthday banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the members of the Augustine family were already in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how they looked at it, they couldn't see any hope left for the Augustine family. It seemed inevitable that they would lose the bet, bringing shame upon themselves at Godfather's birthday celebration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, both the main and branch bloodlines of the Augustine family wore grim expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all Owen's fault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was the first to fight, yet he lost so quickly. If he had won at least one match, Emma wouldn't have to fight so hard. Maybe Emma could have taken down the opponent all by herself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you blame Owen? Owen did his best, okay? It was Emma who didn't grasp his strategy and prematurely conceded, causing Owen's efforts to be wasted!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are you blaming Emma now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not! Emma did her best. If anyone is to blame, it's Sam, Lance, and Maxwell. Those three are completely useless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone argued under their breath. Owen and Lance's faces darken at the murmurs among the Augustine family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They heard the whispers but couldn't refute them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen could only say coldly, "Matthew is just wasting time. Does he really think bringing Osborne will give us a chance? Osborne's strength is at most on par with Maxwell or Sam. He'll probably be easily defeated by Aresta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aresta has recovered at least half of his strength by now. Osborne probably won't even withstand a single move from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was totally a waste of time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Emma glanced at Owen with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least Matthew is still trying to do something. And what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, furious, was about to retort when Aresta suddenly spoke again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sneer on his face, Aresta shouted, "Does the Augustine family have anyone left to fight? You're wasting everyone's time. If there's no one left, you might as well admit defeat directly, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words infuriated the members of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You claim to be the first ancient family of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>? What a joke! You can't even find someone to fight. It's laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, he arrogantly looked around the room, his expression full of provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members felt deeply humiliated, but they were powerless to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said the Augustine family has no one left to fight? Here he is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Matthew's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked over, and Matthew strode in. Behind him was Osborne, who was freshly released from the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family looked at Osborne, and many who didn't know him sighed when they saw how young he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over! I thought Matthew would bring someone formidable, but he found someone so young. Is this man even older than Emma?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's so young. How could he possibly fight against the Godson from </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many in the Augustine family were now even more despairing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the members of the branch bloodline from </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, seeing Osborne, were suddenly filled with excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You're out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing their voice, Osborne looked toward Nathan and the others, nodding to signal that he was fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, ignoring the many gazes fixed on him, Osborne looked toward Godfather, who was seated in the main seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Godfather was also watching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather's expression was extremely calm, betraying no emotion. It looked like he was merely looking at an ordinary member of the Augustine family. However, Osborne noticed that Godfather's grip on his black-gold cane was slightly tighter than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and slowly walked forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was just a few dozens of feet away from Godfather, Osborne stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staring at Godfather, who was now very close to him, Osborne's eyes suddenly grew red as he struggled to control his emotions. He bowed deeply and said in a loud voice, "Happy eightieth birthday, Grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, many people frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had called Godfather "Grandfather". It wasn't technically wrong. After all, the younger generation of the Augustine family could indeed address Godfather as "Grandfather".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, none of them dared to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't notice that when Osborne addressed him as "Grandfather," Godfather, who was usually calm, trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather quickly regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "Osborne, you've done well. You are now the Augustine family's heir-apparent. Keep up the good work, and don't disappoint me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Godfather finished speaking, everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Just because Osborne has called him Grandfather, Godfather praised him? Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bastard sure knows how to curry favor!" Owen snorted, clearly displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, however, raised an eyebrow, looking as if she had learned something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored them and nodded firmly at Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't let you down, Grandfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne turned and looked toward Aresta on the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta, who had previously been severely injured by Lance, had recovered much of his strength by now. Confidence radiated from his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at him, step by step, approaching the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta looked at Osborne with disdain, a sneer on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had felt it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta could tell that Osborne wasn't even at the level of Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Osborne was only at Class A+!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Aresta, Osborne was nothing but trash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne paid no attention to his disdain. He said calmly, "You are the Godson who is ranked thirteenth in </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>? Very well. I am Osborne, the heir-apparent of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
