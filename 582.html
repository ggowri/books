  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's there? Who's talking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne jumped up abruptly, his expression tense and on high alert as he shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he still couldn't hear his own voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because of this that the voice in his mind seemed so eerie. He couldn't hear his own voice, yet he could hear someone else's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of fear that he couldn't suppress emerged within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no use shouting. You can't see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aged voice reappeared in Osborne's mind, as clear as if someone were hiding and speaking inside his brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to be afraid. I won't hurt you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just someone who has been trapped here for a very long time. It's rare to encounter someone with such a pure soul as yours, so I couldn't resist having a chat with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, quickly calming himself down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke again, "Sir, you just mentioned that the stronger one's soul power, the more intense the mental shock they endure here? What's the reason for this? What exactly is this place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his questions, there was no response for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after a while, the aged voice continued, "Young man before I answer your question, can you answer one of mine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded without hesitation. "What would you like to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you believe in deities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback and then nodded. "I didn't use to believe. I thought deities were just a spiritual crutch for ordinary people, made up and not real. But now, I think deities do exist. They are probably just the most powerful few."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter suddenly echoed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. Deities are indeed the most powerful few! Now that you believe in their existence, we can continue our conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just asked me what this place is. Now, I'll answer you, but whether you believe it or not is up to you. This place is actually a tomb of a deity from the era of the gods, where they buried themselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A deity's tomb?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! A deity's tomb! Our planet once experienced an era of the gods, a brilliant era when numerous powerful deities existed and managed this planet together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The owner of this tomb was a rather ordinary deity during that era, but by today's standards, he would be considered an invincible being, capable of easily destroying cities and crumbling nations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The era of the gods is beyond your imagination!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, even though the deities were powerful, they still had enemies. The universe is vast. Not only did we have deities here, but other planets also fostered their own. These deities traversed the cosmos, intending to enslave all beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our deities, unwilling to be enslaved, chose to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thus, a war of the gods broke out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this place, it was one of the battlegrounds of that war, where one deity buried himself to severely injure an evil foreign deity, trapping him in an eternal slumber here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All energy here has been obliterated, turning it into a desolate world, all in hopes that the evil invader would never recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, despite the long years, although the evil foreign deity has not awoken, his power is slowly regenerating and even beginning to seep out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mental shocks you feel are the dispersal of his energy, a power of deities that you naturally cannot withstand. And the stronger and purer the soul, the greater the damage inflicted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Osborne's mouth hung open in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like he was listening to a story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "An era of the gods?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evil foreign deities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wanting to enslave all life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A war of the gods?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A god's tomb?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt it was a bit far-fetched, thinking, "Is he treating me like a child and trying to scare me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed, ready to object, when he suddenly remembered Isa's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa also mentioned the era of the gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had even referred to a force from the era of the gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Court of the Sun!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne asked, "Sir, how do you know about the era of the gods? Who are you exactly? Since you know about the era of the gods. Have you heard of the Court of the Sun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, the dungeon began to shake violently, as if the sky were collapsing and time and space were turning upside down, making it difficult for Osborne to even stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the excited voice of the aged figure rang out in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, where did you hear about the Court of the Sun?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually know about the Court of the Sun? How is that possible? Who are you? Who told you about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, you know of the Court of the Sun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I know! The Court of the Sun was the most powerful divine force during the era of gods! The conclusion of the godly war was achieved when the God of Night and the God of Death from the Court of the Sun intervened to defeat the invading evil deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you know this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aged man was now extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was more stunned, his eyes wide and his mouth agape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not joking?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mentioned the God of Night? And the God of Death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, is that you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you just telling me a scary story to tease me? I think you're just itching for a prank!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
