  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle came to an unexpected halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Terrence and Divine Shadow were at the peak of their Transcendent Deity powers, once-top-tier Deity Overlords whose strengths were more or less equal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Continuing their fight would yield no clear victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, Terrence knew he was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Deschanel Clan lay in ruin, and now, over four thousand Blood Demon members, along with Osborne and the God of Star, had closed in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They did not rush to strike; instead, they formed a tight perimeter, leaving Terrence acutely aware of his grim fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was done for, and so was the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With blood-red eyes scanning the encroaching crowd, a wave of despair washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Terrence of the Deschanel Clan, survived the calamity brought by Lord Malevolence! I evaded Celestara's destruction, only to meet my demise here! This is unacceptable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze intently on Osborne, his voice a venomous hiss. "So it's you, the head of the Augustine family, Osborne? Ha! Just a fresh-faced kid! In the Age of Gods, I could've wiped a hundred like you with a mere breath!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, somehow, I'm about to be defeated by you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't stand for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the patriarch of the Deschanel Clan, I challenge you. How about a duel? This is our battle for honor. If I lose, I'll die, and the Deschanel Clan will perish with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I win, you'll let me go, and I'll vow never to fight the Augustine family again! What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His proclamation sent murmurs of concern rippling through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow insisted urgently, "Osborne, don't accept! He may not be at his peak now, just a Transcendent Deity like you, but he was once a top Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His experience and command over power are far beyond most others at this level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't fall for his tricks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star chimed in, "He's cornered&mdash;he knows he's done for! If you accept his challenge, he'll unleash everything he's got! Just take him down already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned slightly, nodding. "You both make valid points, Grandma Divine Shadow, God of Star."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's countenance hardened dramatically at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted in rage. "Osborne, what's wrong? Are you chicken? Scared to face me in combat? Afraid of losing? Ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mockery dripped from his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow scoffed, saying, "Terrence, you have some nerve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long have you been around? Not counting the years you've spent in slumber, you've lived for centuries! And now you have the audacity to challenge him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you even realize how young Osborne is? He's barely in his twenties!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let him get under your skin, Osborne! You're still young&mdash;don't fall for his taunts! Your future will far exceed his; there's absolutely no reason for you to clash with him now. Don't give him the chance to survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence laughed heartily in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what? Not daring to face me is still not daring! You're scared of me! Scared I'll wipe the floor with you! If you don't have the guts to step up, let your lackeys do the dirty work. Just proves you're nothing but trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to smile at Terrence, fully aware that the clan leader was intentionally trying to provoke him and shake his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne were to today truly chicken out of accepting Terrence's challenge, instead opting to have the Blood Demon members swarm and ultimately kill Terrence, Terrence's words would become a thorn burrowing deep into Osborne's heart forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, it might not mean much to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he climbed to higher realms in the future, where mental fortitude was paramount, Terrence's words would magnify exponentially, turning into a demon dwelling within his psyche, hindering his progress and preventing him from breaking into new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrence, no need to goad me with such talk. I merely mentioned that Grandma Divine Shadow and God of Star made some valid points and didn't say I wouldn't accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to play, fine by me&mdash;let's dance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take you on, and if I lose, I promise to spare your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't voice the next part out loud. "Just prepare to be transformed into a Blood Clan member."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware of Osborne's true intentions, Terrence beamed. "Hahaha, bravo! That's the gutsy spirit of someone who's managed to push my Deschanel Clan to the brink of extinction. Remember your word, Osborne. Break it, and may the Augustine family face utter annihilation, may every single one of them die a wretched death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled serenely, "No problem at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Divine Shadow and God of Star grew anxious and wanted to intervene further, but Osborne waved them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Grandma Divine Shadow, God of Star, he's not going anywhere," Osborne assured them before stepping forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrence, brimming with confidence, spoke coldly, "Come on then, let's see what gives you such self-assurance! And by the way, at this point, you might as well drop the act and let us see your Divine Flame!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
