  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the Apocalypse Bow, completely unable to think of any solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't even channel his Sacred Power into the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in his hands, the Apocalypse Bow felt like an ordinary stone, perhaps even less than a stone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the material of the Apocalypse Bow was incredibly unique.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was covered in scars, with the largest one seemingly capable of breaking the Apocalypse Bow at any moment, no matter how hard Osborne tried, the Apocalypse Bow remained unbelievably sturdy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's immense strength couldn't budge the Apocalypse Bow at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This shows that the Apocalypse Bow is far from ordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right, I can ask Primordial," Osborne said. He suddenly remembered that he was no longer in the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Celestial Spire, he couldn't contact Primordial or the Warfare Ancient Tree. However, now that he had left the Celestial Spire, their communication was no longer restricted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps Primordial and the Warfare Ancient Tree have a solution." Thinking this, Osborne immediately called out to Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Primordial appeared on Osborne's shoulder, yawning. "What do you need me for? Why did I just fall asleep? I haven't slept so comfortably in ages."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial hadn't just fallen asleep; it was suppressed by the power of the Celestial Spire, which forcibly put it into a state of slumber.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Osborne explain the situation, Primordial was stunned. "That's impossible. I'm an offshoot of a World Tree. Even though my cultivation level isn't high, how could I be forcibly suppressed and put into a slumber? Where is that Celestial Spire?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pointed above their heads.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial looked up and was stunned, a look of fear appearing in its eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked in surprise, "Do you know the Celestial Spire?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shook its head and said gravely, "I don't know it, but I feel it's terrifying and could easily crush us all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course." Osborne rolled his eyes, feeling a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I had hoped Primordial could recognize the Celestial Spire. But I was wrong. There's no record of the Celestial Spire in Primordial's memory either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Primordial was very interested in the Celestial Spire and kept asking questions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly explained the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was shocked again and said seriously, "This Celestial Spire is extraordinary. Its level might even surpass that of a Sovereign Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "The Celestial Spire's level is higher than a Sovereign Artifact? That's impossible. Isn't the Sovereign Artifact the strongest in the cosmos?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're right," Primordial said calmly. "In the cosmos, the Sovereign Artifact is indeed the strongest. But what if this Celestial Spire isn't from the cosmos?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "Are you talking about the Umbra World?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded. "It's possible, but I'm not sure. However, based on your description, this Celestial Spire is at least a Sovereign Artifact, maybe even more powerful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued, "Forget it, don't think about it. Even if it's a Sovereign Artifact, you can't control it now. There's a huge gap between you and it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and said calmly, "How is that possible? I already have two Sovereign Artifacts. One is the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear, and the other is the Apocalypse Bow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial sneered, "How can they be called Sovereign Artifacts? They've been wrecked and can at most unleash power comparable to an Imperial Artifact now. I suggest you throw away such trash."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Especially that Apocalypse Bow. How can it be called the Supremacy Bow of the Cosmos? I've never even heard of it. I think it's fake. Otherwise, how could it show no reaction at all? It doesn't dare to react. If it does, it will be exposed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Primordial kept winking at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned for a moment, then understood what Primordial meant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He followed Primordial's words and said, "You're absolutely right. This Apocalypse Bow dares to claim to be the Supremacy Bow of the Cosmos. I also think it's fake. I believe it's not even as good as my Bloodwrought Bow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It seems to reject me, but I think it doesn't dare let me use it, because once I do, it will be exposed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial agreed, "Exactly. It's just trash. You should throw it away. I'll help you find a more powerful bow in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright." As he spoke, Osborne suddenly felt the Apocalypse Bow in his hand tremble slightly. Immediately, a surge of power erupted from the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne felt the Sacred Power within him completely drained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, an arrow appeared out of thin air and shot toward Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The arrow pierced through Primordial's body. Primordial let out a scream and then fell off Osborne's shoulder. A large hole appeared in his chest, unable to heal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left Osborne stunned. He thought, "It's so fast! Its speed is incredible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Apocalypse Bow in his hand suddenly released an arrow, piercing through Primordial's body. Not only did Primordial fail to dodge, but Osborne also couldn't react in time to stop it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly looked at Primordial. Seeing that Primordial was unharmed, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne looked at the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Apocalypse Bow hovered in midair, circling around Primordial as if mocking him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked because he actually sensed the consciousness of the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Apocalypse Bow has consciousness too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's mocking words angered the Apocalypse Bow, causing it to suddenly unleash its power and teach Primordial a harsh lesson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only that, the Apocalypse Bow also mocked Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a surge of information suddenly appeared in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne opened his mouth in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial got up and glared at the Apocalypse Bow. "I knew you were pretending to be dead. Since you're a Sovereign Artifact, you must have already developed consciousness, an Artifact Soul. Even if you're shattered, you can still hide your power so perfectly, which led me to conclude that your Artifact Soul is still alive. So, I used this method to provoke you, and sure enough, you reacted."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, I still don't believe you are the Supremacy Bow of the Cosmos. I don't know if others believe it, but I certainly don't."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Primordial climbed back onto Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just mocked the Apocalypse Bow on purpose to provoke its Artifact Soul together with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, he succeeded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he was also shot by the Apocalypse Bow as a result. Luckily, the Apocalypse Bow only wanted to teach him a lesson and didn't seriously injure him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's the situation now? Have you connected with the Apocalypse Bow's Artifact Soul?" Osborne asked, looking at the dazed Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "The Apocalypse Bow's Artifact Soul is very weak. It said I can use it, but only once a day and only for one shot. In return, I have to find a way to repair it. The better it recovers, the more frequently I can use it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the Apocalypse Bow, there was actually a living Artifact Soul, just like in the Celestial Spire. This Artifact Soul allowed Osborne to use the Apocalypse Bow, but he could only shoot one arrow a day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's the use of that? Besides, Osborne didn't even dare to think about repairing the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Apocalypse Bow is a Sovereign Artifact. Osborne simply doesn't have materials of such high grade to repair it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps he could only rely on the Warfare Ancient Tree to gradually restore the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't overthink it. Being able to shoot one arrow with the Apocalypse Bow was better than not being able to use it at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Apocalypse Bow could still unleash the power of a Supreme Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An arrow it shoots might severely wound a supreme warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "I'm ready. It's time to enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><div class="pagination">
