  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't you stopping him? Mr. Baxter is inside buying the Miracle Elixir, and I suspect he has ulterior motives! He might try to snatch it away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quickly, grab him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young men and women shouted at the sales clerk, who looked flustered and was about to explain when Osborne stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile plastered on his face, Osborne observed the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These young elites, having broken through to become Deity King at such a young age, clearly hailed from influential backgrounds. Their association with Kurt suggested they belonged to some of the First-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze fell on the most arrogant-looking young man in the group. "What gives you the right to say I can't go in? Is the Miracle Elixir reserved for you? Why can't I take a look? Who knows, I might be interested in buying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man scoffed, his disdain evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can buy the Miracle Elixir? Ha! What are you, some nobody? Just one of those costs at least a hundred Celestial Crystals! Some can even go for over a thousand Celestial Crystals. Do you really think you can afford that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not just you, but even we'd have to save for years to buy a single one! Only someone like Mr. Baxter can casually purchase the Miracle Elixir!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look unfamiliar. You must not be from Apocalypse City, right? Better not disturb Mr. Baxter while he's trying to buy the Miracle Elixir, or you'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words drew laughter and sneers from the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Oh really? Since you've said that, I guess I have to buy the Miracle Elixir now! I wasn't even planning to, but now that you've challenged me, I'll just have to compete with Kurt for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Kurt can't get the Miracle Elixir, it'll be all your fault."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned his back on them and walked toward the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group's expressions hardened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there! I told you, you have no right to go in! Sales clerk, why aren't you stopping him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the sales clerk found her moment to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, but this gentleman does have the right to enter! He has passed the asset verification."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group froze, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? He's actually qualified to enter? He passed the asset verification?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To view the Miracle Elixir, you either need a First-rate Power background like us or to verify at least a hundred Celestial Crystals! This country bumpkin has a hundred Celestial Crystals? No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he really be looking to buy the Miracle Elixir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! Those Miracle Elixirs are crucial for Mr. Baxter! He's stated he must acquire them all! If someone snatches even one or two away, he'll be furious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow him! We can't let him ruin Mr. Baxter's plans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they rushed into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their connections with the First-rate Powers ensured that the staff at the Luminous Commerce Center wouldn't stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne entered the room, he found the layout quite simple, reminiscent of a small auction house. Aside from Kurt, there were a handful of other people scattered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon entering, Kurt immediately strode to the front, and the moment the others saw him, their expressions shifted. They quickly stood up, eager to greet him, their faces filled with ingratiating smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter, you're here too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like we've wasted our trip again. Those ten Miracle Elixirs are probably all going to belong to you, Mr. Baxter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of over a dozen people buzzed with excitement, eagerly chatting with Kurt. But he paid them no mind, strutting past with an air of arrogance, heading straight for the front row where a young man stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This young man, Tristan Hudson, was the only one in the room who hadn't risen to greet Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt shot him a cold and disdainful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tristan, why don't you get lost? I've got my eye on this spot, and I want to sit here, so... you better move along!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Tristan's face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He met Kurt's gaze head-on, his voice steady. "Kurt, what's the deal? There are plenty of seats in the front row, and the center spot is still empty. Why don't you just sit there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt shrugged, a nonchalant grin on his face. "I want to sit here. Is that a problem? Or are you feeling feisty? You've got five seconds to decide if you're moving or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't say I didn't warn you if you don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt crossed his arms, exuding confidence and entitlement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!" Tristan's face turned beet red, his jaw clenched in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ultimately, he stood up, defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kurt, just you wait..." he muttered, his voice laced with bitterness as he turned away, opting to sit in the second row instead of lingering in the front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding crowd couldn't help but snicker at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Hudson family is really on the decline!" one remarked, shaking their head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tristan's a Hudson family scion, too, but even though his status doesn't match Kurt's, in the past, he would never have let Kurt treat him like this. He would've fought back!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, the Hudson family has to swallow their pride!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan's expression darkened further at their comments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Kurt was reveling in his victory, ready to plop down in the seat Tristan had vacated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone else slipped in ahead of him, shoving Kurt aside and taking the seat for himself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
