  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly glanced at the defense layout and couldn't help but nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys are truly a professional security team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This defense layout is great, and you have thought it through perfectly. I've taken a cursory look at it, and you've prepared for almost every possible danger with advance warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, whenever the enemies try to attack us, they will definitely be discovered by us, and we'll have enough time to get ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin instantly smiled and nodded when Osborne finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's what we should do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Great, make sure you have a proper defense! You should not only defend against attacks from the outside, but also against internal chaos."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, go ahead to work. This defense layout will be left here with me, and I have to carefully read it. Remember, this defense layout is absolutely confidential, and you can't ever let anyone know about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If our enemies know about our defense layout, they can surely find flaws in our defense and sneak in silently to attack us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, our losses will be huge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked incredibly serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin instantly became serious and hurriedly said, "Don't worry. Other than you and I, only Mr. Isaac Augustine from the Augustine family has read this defense layout. The members from Skyefall Security Services only know part of it, so we definitely won't leak it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Valentin left, Osborne continued to work on the defense layout, but his attention was really focused on a few other people in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Ryan, Kaden, Nathan, and Queenie, Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was watching their actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to be curious about the defense layout, and they all wanted to take a look at it, but none of them dared to come over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently, "This defense layout is certainly good. At least I can't tell many flaws with my eyes, but I have to study it a bit more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne entered the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne closed the door to his room, he didn't really study the defense layout but opened Satan's Eye to observe the people outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his eyes were incredibly indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a spy in the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne's fifth test as an heir, his first task was to find the spy in the Augustine family, but he couldn't be sure exactly who it was until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first person he suspected was Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, through observation, he gradually gave up his suspicion of Ryan. Ryan didn't look like a spy, and he hadn't sent any messages with the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever it is, I'm going to take this opportunity to find this spy out this time. A great man once said that the most unlikely person is the most likely one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished thinking about it, Osborne began to get it ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yulissa, come in. I'm not sure about this defense layout, so how about you take a look at it for me and give me some advice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was stunned when she heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, since this defense layout is so important, the less people know about it, the better, right? Can I really read it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled lightly, "Don't worry, you are my sister and the person I trust the most, so of course you can read it! Also, you are all the best of the young generation and our future of the Augustine family, so you are all trustworthy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time for you to do something about the future of the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa looked excited as she followed Osborne into the room. Osborne put the defense layout in front of Yulissa and asked her to make some comments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa genuinely gave Osborne a few ideas and found a few flaws in the defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yulissa, your advice is excellent, and I'll keep it in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go and get Ryan, maybe he can give me some useful advice, too. Remember, you shouldn't ever leak this defense layout. You can't talk to anyone about this defense layout except me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I know it, and I'll never tell anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa went out cheerfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Ryan also came in. Osborne also asked him to read the defense layout, hoping he could suggest some improvements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan also gave Osborne a few tips after he read it. Osborne was satisfied, complimented him, and told him to go out and call Nathan in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Nathan, Kaden and Queenie all entered Osborne's room one after another. They all read the defense layout and offered Osborne some ideas for improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great. You are worthy of being the best members of the younger generation of the Augustine family. Your opinions are valuable, and I will consider them seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne walked out of the room to find Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the five people in the living room all looked excited, as they were delighted to have Osborne's trust and to give him advice that would help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a day had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the fleet of twenty-two cruise ships from the Augustine family and the Montague family had already left the coastline of Rosmandi and entered the open sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction would last for seven days, with the first three days being display time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the jewels to be auctioned would be displayed to all the guests on the twenty-two cruise ships in turn, so that the guests could appreciate and appraise them closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction would officially begin three days later, and it would last for four days in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mighty Scepter would be auctioned on the first day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Holy Crown, on the other hand, would be auctioned on the last day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast sea was calm at this moment, but Osborne knew it was just the peace before the storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When will the Aberrants attack?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
