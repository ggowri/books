  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's expression remained calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Osborne's mockery, he was not angry but rather delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket had appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had thought this plan was a complete failure, and he would never step into the Eighth Skyfall Casket again. However, the key appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was undoubtedly the best news for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Seraphina, Emiliano, and others he mistakenly killed, he didn't care at all. Even if they died unjustly, it didn't matter to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only thing he cared about was the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over the key, and I might spare your life!" Frederick said again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh, thinking, "Sure enough, Frederick has completely turned into a ruthless person. Even with my mocking, he remains indifferent, caring only about the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Someone like him doesn't deserve to live."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "You want the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket? Dream on! If you dare make a move, I guarantee I'll throw the key into that black vortex immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That black vortex is raging wildly, even small Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors would be instantly crushed if they got close. I wonder if it can destroy this key?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if it can't be destroyed, you probably wouldn't dare to enter the black vortex to search for the key, would you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, Frederick's expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He warned harshly, "If you dare throw the key into the black vortex, I swear I'll torture you to death in the cruelest way! You will regret your choice!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered disdainfully, "Who are you trying to scare? If I can't live, why would I give you the key and let you benefit? Worst case, I'll enter the black vortex too. Torture me? Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick fell silent upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at Osborne with a sinister gaze and gritted his teeth, asking, "What exactly do you want? Speak!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said calmly, "You want the key, and I want to survive. However, I don't trust you. If I hand over the key, you'll turn around and betray us, striking mercilessly. So, I won't be that foolish."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick said, "Then you can simply use the key yourself to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket. I don't know what's inside the Eighth Skyfall Casket, but once you enter it, I definitely won't be able to hunt you down anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, as long as you open and enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket, you'll be safe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, what Frederick truly wanted was not the key itself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he craved was to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket and enter it, as it contained the power to greatly enhance his strength, possibly even breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the key itself, Frederick didn't really care much about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if it was an Imperial Artifact, he didn't mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, for him, as long as Osborne didn't destroy the key and was willing to use it to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket, that was enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh again after hearing this. "Open the Eighth Skyfall Casket? That would be too easy for you! Everyone knows you dream of entering the Skyfall Casket. Why should I help you? I think destroying the key is safer! Even if I die, I won't let you succeed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was instantly furious upon hearing this. "You'd rather die than open the Eighth Skyfall Casket, is that it? There's a huge secret hidden there. Once it's opened, everyone can enter and have a chance to skyrocket their strength!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed and said, "But I think the biggest beneficiary of opening the Eighth Skyfall Casket would definitely be you. If you break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, would you spare us? Either way, the result is death, so why should I let you take advantage?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You!" Frederick gritted his teeth, his killing intent surging like a tide.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If possible, he wanted to eliminate Osborne immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he knew he couldn't do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind Osborne stood Adriana, whose strength was almost equal to his. At this moment, she was highly vigilant. If he made a move, Adriana would undoubtedly strike immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, stopping him for a short time wouldn't be a problem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne really stepped into that black vortex with the key, it would be too late for him to regret it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Frederick could only forcibly suppress his inner rage and coldly said, "What exactly do you want? Just say it! I know you would never rather die than let me enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There isn't such deep hatred between us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne heard this and sneered inwardly. "Not such deep hatred? No! There definitely is between us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne had no intention of telling Frederick now that he was the same Osborne who was expelled from the palace over a thousand years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now is not the time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He calmly said, "I don't know what I want to do either. But I think you should show your sincerity first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's gaze shifted to Callista. "For example, I want you to slap her hard twice right now! If you're willing to do as I say, I&rsquo;ll see your sincerity and might consider opening the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Callista's face instantly turned grim. "What nonsense are you spouting? How dare you try to stir trouble between us as a couple?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Why are you yelling? You almost scared me! Now it seems two slaps aren't enough; it has to be four!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You!" Callista instantly burned with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne completely ignored her anger, merely staring coldly at Frederick and softly saying, "Frederick, show me your sincerity! Slap her hard four times, and maybe I'll consider opening the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's the Skyfall Casket you've long desired."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thousands of years ago, the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet became so powerful because they entered the Ninth Skyfall Casket. Three of them likely broke through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness directly within the Skyfall Casket, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once you reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, you can step onto the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, traveling deeper into the vast universe! In the depths of the universe, the Divine Principle is more complete, allowing you to easily gain greater power and break through to higher cultivation levels."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With your talent, how can you settle for staying at the edge of the universe? It's simply wasting your potential! Even if you venture into the depths of the universe, you'll undoubtedly be the brightest genius. One day, you'll surpass Solomon and become the top ruler and master of this cosmos!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne's voice seemed to carry a bewitching power, making Frederick's breathing grow rapid."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He felt that Osborne seemed to know him very well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What Osborne said was exactly his lifelong dream."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He must break through Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He will step onto the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, venture into the depths of the universe, take his talent there, surpass his ancestors, and become the strongest in the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the key to all this lies in breaking through Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because only by reaching Imperial Empyrean Sacredness can he enter the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign and leave this universe's edge, where spiritual energy is scarce, resources are lacking, and the Divine Principle is incomplete."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He must break through Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And his only hope is to enter the Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, Frederick's eyes were red with excitement."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "As long as I slap her four times, you'll open the Eighth Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "Go ahead and slap first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Frederick nodded, then turned his cold, merciless gaze to Callista. "You, come here!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
