  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno couldn't believe his luck; Osborne had followed him out of the base with hardly a second thought, completely unsuspecting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the elaborate speeches he'd prepared the night before suddenly felt redundant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that was fine by him. As long as Osborne followed him to the No. 7 mining area, his mission would be complete. After that, it would be Guy's responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy had set a trap there long ago. Once Osborne walked right into it, there'd be no escaping unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A glint of satisfaction flickered in Bruno's eyes as he thought this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Hop onto my Malevolence Airship. It's mid-grade, like the others, but it performs better and is faster, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno pulled out a mid-grade Malevolence Airship assigned to chiliarchs by the Wild Flame Army. After channeling his divine power, the airship transformed into a massive vessel stretching nearly a hundred yards long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a sense of urgency, he led Osborne aboard and took off at breakneck speed toward the No. 7 mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only about 60 thousand miles from Wild Flame City, and with their airship, they reached the vicinity in just half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they approached their destination, Osborne played his part well, glancing around nervously and asking, "Bruno, where are those Deathborns? They haven't escaped, have they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno chuckled coldly in his mind but replied, "Don't worry; they won't just take off like that! I've got a general idea of where they are. Just stick close to me! But we need to pick up the pace. If other teams arrive first, you might miss out on this chance to earn personal third-class merit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Bruno pressed on in a hurried direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne followed, feigning anxiety. "We've got to move fast! Without that third-class merit, who knows how long I'll be waiting to be promoted to chiliarch! Lead the way, Mr. Bruno Borden. I'm right behind you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno felt a rush of glee; things couldn't have gone smoother. He was effortlessly guiding Osborne toward the trap Guy had prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "This fool. He's strong, but he's got no street smarts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Doesn't he realize how treacherous people can be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's followed me out here without a shred of caution. If he dies, nobody will be the wiser! I'll just say he was taken out by the Deathborn, and there'll be no loose ends to tie up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With scorn filling his mind, Bruno pressed on, feeling like he was leading the na&iuml;ve Osborne straight to hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unbeknownst to Bruno, Osborne had secretly activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "Let me see where Guy is hiding and what preparations he's made. I need to be careful&mdash;Guy's a Deity Overlord-level warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With newfound vision granted by Satan's Eye, Osborne quickly scanned the area and spotted traces nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like another abandoned mine. Have these places become mere execution sites?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A smirk appeared on Osborne's face as he continued to observe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the abandoned mine, there was only Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, he was confident enough to think he could handle Osborne alone, without any backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, what he truly wanted was any ancient divine artifacts Osborne might possess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bringing along an extra pair of hands would only mean less treasure for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just Guy? That takes a lot of pressure off! This will be the perfect place to deal with both of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought, Osborne quickened his pace, closely following Bruno as they neared their destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, it's right here! In this mine! The Deathborn have to be lurking around; we'll head deeper in, use some Soul Resonance Fluid to draw them out and take them down quickly. You'll earn your personal third-class merit in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At these words, excitement lit up Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are we waiting for? Bruno, you lead the way; I'm all in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, the two of them charged into the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they ventured deeper into the darkness, Bruno's smile widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "We're almost there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just a little further to the ambush point, and once Uncle Guy strikes with his Deity Overlord strength, Osborne's going to be in for a world of hurt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It'll be so easy to capture him after that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're almost there!" Driven by his anticipation, Bruno quickened his pace, guiding Osborne right to the ambush spot he had agreed upon with Guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were only a few hundred yards away from the perfect position for the sudden attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Bruno could practically see the scene unfold in his mind&mdash;Osborne, caught off guard by Guy's surprise assault, lying injured and helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then, without warning, Osborne made his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caught off guard, Bruno could hardly believe it. The usually obedient Osborne, who had been trailing behind him, suddenly attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time he registered what was happening, it was far too late to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a thunderous crack, Osborne's fist slammed into Bruno's back, sending him hurtling through the air, blood spewing from his mouth.</span></p><div class="pagination">
