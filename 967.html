  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen's face twisted with fury. "Sure, the Aberrants is only offering us a measly 40% of the rare metal mining rights, but hey, something's better than nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Both our League of Divine Descent and your Eityreia Organization need those Rosmandi rare metal mines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once we help the Aberrants wipe out all the superpowers in Rosmandi, including the Augustine family and the Draco Group, we'll each walk away with 20% of those mines. That'll be more than enough for a while!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Neither the Augustine family nor the Aberrants have any idea what treasures lie within those rare metal mines!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They're sitting on a goldmine and don't even know how to tap into it. Once we get our hands on those resources, our power will skyrocket!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Soon, the gods will rise again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who cares about the Court of the Sun or those so-called 'global agreements'? They won't be able to hold us back! With our two superpowers joining forces, the entire world will be ours!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone will be our subjects!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression grew manic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sin and Crimson exchanged glances, their faces mirroring Rumen's wild enthusiasm. They laughed, caught up in the fever of ambition and greed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, what's the latest on the war between the Aberrants and the Augustine family?" Rumen suddenly inquired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sin and Crimson shook their heads. "This is Rosmandi, after all. Our intel network isn't strong enough here. But it seems both sides are still locked in battle at the border. Sebastian hasn't made a move yet, and Gerardo hasn't shown his hand either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We do know that Sebastian's Draco Armed Services Branch has taken heavy losses, but a new faction called the 'Blood Demon' has emerged, and they seem pretty formidable. That's likely Sebastian's trump card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Aberrants may have a ton of clones, but it'll take them a while to overpower the Blood Demon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen said, "Just the way I like it! If the Aberrants can easily crush the Augustine family and the Draco Group, it would diminish our value.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's find Gerardo and discuss our collaboration. But before we leave, I want to make sure the Augustine family feels some pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"While we can't start a full-blown war, taking a few lives isn't off the table!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen's eyes glinted with malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sin and Crimson exchanged wary looks. "You're thinking of going after the Augustine family? Are you not worried about that mysterious powerhouse they have hiding away? Didn't he say we're not allowed to step foot in their territory?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen scoffed. "What a load of nonsense! If he was truly strong, he wouldn't just threaten us; he'd have taken us out already!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, your injuries are mostly healed. The four of us together&mdash;who could stand against us? If he dares to intervene, we'll just take him down!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go to the Augustine Estate!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then led the way out of the lavish mansion. The four of them soon found themselves at the Augustine Estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wesson! Get out here!" Rumen bellowed, his voice booming like thunder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Augustine family flinched, instinctively covering their ears at the sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson, along with Miranda, Fiona, and Ashley&mdash;four Class S powerhouses&mdash;materialized a short distance away, their expressions gloomy and tense as they locked eyes with Rumen and Everett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson said, his tone steady but edged with tension, "Rumen, Everett, what do you want? I've already told you, we will never agree to your League of Divine Descent's terms! If you have the guts, declare war!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen chuckled coldly. "Wesson, I'm not here to negotiate. I just came to drop by and, frankly, I'm in the mood to spill some blood before we leave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's face paled as realization dawned on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shouted, "You wouldn't dare!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Augustine Estate is home to a seasoned elder whose power you've likely already witnessed. If you dare to enter our territory and disturb his peace, watch out for your own life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen laughed uproariously. "Ha! You think you can scare me? Nice try, but I'm not afraid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kill them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Rumen and Everett charged into the Augustine Estate, unleashing a torrent of devastating attacks that enveloped Wesson and his companions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The expressions on the faces of Wesson and his three allies turned grave as they braced themselves for the onslaught.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The battle erupted violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Wesson's group had the numbers, they were no match for the ferocious combination of Rumen and Everett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tide quickly turned against them, and it became increasingly clear that they were on the verge of being overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just when it seemed they wouldn't hold out any longer, a horde of Class AAA fighters burst onto the scene. "Wesson, we're here to help!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wesson, we're here to help!" The elders of the Augustine family, Emma, Vincent, and other Class AAA warriors, came rushing to Wesson's rescue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen sneered, saying, "Ha! This is just what I needed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today, we'll wipe you all out and crush any hope left in the Augustine family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With renewed ferocity, he targeted the incoming reinforcements, and it was evident that the Augustine family fighters hadn't prepared for such brutality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a cold voice cut through the chaos. "I warned you, this is my sanctuary. I have zero tolerance for noise. You dare to turn a deaf ear to my threat and disturb my peace? It seems the only solution is to eliminate every last one of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No sooner had the words sank in than a blinding white light surged toward Rumen and Everett, threatening to obliterate everything in its path.</p><div class="pagination">
