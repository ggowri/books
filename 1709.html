  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you?!" Osborne quickly typed a response to Hannah, his heart racing with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waited impatiently for a reply, but as the seconds ticked by with no response, his worry only deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He urged, sending multiple voice messages, "Please, just tell me where you are!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to know your location!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept sending messages, hoping Hannah would respond. He couldn't let her be killed by the Paramount Supreme Clan's Bowman family. He had to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seemed Hannah sensed his intentions to rescue her. Perhaps she was in the middle of a fight or didn't want to drag him into her troubles; whatever the reason, she remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's anxiety grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip and spoke urgently into the device, "Hannah! I know you saw my messages! Answer me right now! Where are you? Don't you consider me a friend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be honest</span><span>. </span><span>I killed Tobey!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you get caught by the Bowman family because of this, I'll never find peace! I swear, if you die, I will hunt down the Bowman family for revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're trying to protect me, but if you die, I will have no choice but to go after them! I swear, because you're my friend and this is my fault, I'll go to the ends of the earth for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending the message, Osborne waited anxiously. Finally, he received a reply from Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you so foolish? Why would you tell me you killed Tobey? Aren't you afraid I might betray you? Why would you even think of saving me? Or going after the Bowman family for my sake? Do you have any idea how powerful they are?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't be reckless! If I die, then Tobey's story ends with me. I'll take the blame for killing him. You just need to live!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot back. "No! I won't let you die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need you to take the blame! If you even think about doing that, I'll tell everyone it was me who killed Tobey! I don't care how powerful the Bowman family is! If you die, I will go after them without hesitation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you'd better tell me where you are right now! I can save you! Trust me, we can both make it out alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah replied, "You can't save me! I'm already surrounded, and there's no way out! The ones surrounding me are peak Deity Overlords</span><span>, </span><span>dozens of them from the Bowman family's elite!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you're strong, but you're no match for them right now! Please, don't be impulsive! Just let it go, okay? I'm begging you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a mining area not far from Wild Flame City, Hannah was staring at her terminal, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's urgent desire to rescue her touched her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she truly didn't want to drag him into this mess. The Paramount Supreme Clan's Bowman family was no small threat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of peak Deity Overlords had surrounded the entire mining area, equipped with a powerful Spirit Tracer that had locked onto her position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew it wouldn't be long before they found her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with her skills in stealth, she couldn't hide for long against such formidable technology. Even though Hannah had advanced to the mid-level of Deity Overlord, facing dozens of peak Deity Overlords left her with no chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She genuinely wished Osborne wouldn't come for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, it was already too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, Osborne was still at the Divine Peak Nine base, miles away from Wild Flame City. Even with the Ultimate Malevolence Airship, it would take nearly two days to reach her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly save her from so far away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face was streaked with tears as she hurriedly replied to Osborne, "Osborne, thank you for wanting to save me, but it's really too late! They'll find me soon; I can't wait for you to arrive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Farewell... please don't take revenge for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Live a good life; I'm begging you! This is my last request. Just grant me this, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending her message, Hannah prepared to shut down the terminal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, she received another message from Osborne. "Hannah, you need to tell me where you are right now! If you honestly believe I can't reach you in time, what do you have to lose by giving me your location? I promise you, if you tell me where you are, even if I can't save you in time, I won't go after the Bowman family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you don't tell me, I'll make sure to confront them directly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stared at Osborne's words, and her face filled with inner conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she finally exhaled slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won't make it in time, anyway. By the time he arrives, I'll probably already be gone. I might as well tell him where I am..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Hannah reluctantly sent her location to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you'd better keep your word! Now that I've told you my location, you must promise you won't go after the Bowman family in revenge! I can't talk any longer; I need to prepare for battle! My chances of survival are slim, but I have to fight, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Hannah hung up the terminal</span><span> and</span><span> steel</span><span>ed</span><span> herself for what was to come.</span></p><div class="pagination">
