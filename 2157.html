  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others were only Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings. No matter how gifted they were, they could barely hold their own against most Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings. Facing Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, they were already struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Icy Five, an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, attacked them, they felt an overwhelming sense of suffocation, the chilling breath of death washing over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, fear didn't grip their hearts, for they all knew one crucial truth&mdash;They couldn't die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long ago, Osborne had copied their life essences. As long as he was alive, even if they were killed, he could bring them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they faced this moment with a fierce determination, unafraid of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just them; the Blood Demon members and the Hudson family soldiers had their life essences copied too. Even if they </span><span>were killed</span><span>, resurrection awaited them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, at the request of the God of Light, Osborne had also copied the life essences of key figures within the Human Community, including the God of Light herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Anastasia had insisted the God of Light was still alive, urging the Human Alliance to hold on and resist the Dark Deity Legion. She believed that when Osborne returned, he could swiftly revive the God of Light and turn the tide of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, no one believed her, and no one listened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Five's eyes burned with madness. The thrill of being able to personally annihilate the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, such prodigious talents, sent waves of excitement coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Anastasia and her friends as though they were already corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their strength, their cultivation levels were simply too low to withstand the full force of his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were as good as dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, massive dragon figures suddenly surged forward, swirling around Anastasia and her companions, forming a protective wall of dragon shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Draconic Formation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Draconic Formation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless colossal dragon shadows appeared, creating an imposing barrier in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique&mdash;the Draconic Formation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Blood Demon members saw the danger facing Anastasia and the others and didn't hesitate to unleash this powerful defensive technique, one that Osborne had taught them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand Blood Demon members activated the Draconic Formation simultaneously, terrifying dragon figures intertwining to form a solid, formidable wall of defense that stood like a Veil of Despair against Icy Five's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Five's devastating attack crashed against the barrier, causing it to tremble slightly but not shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Icy Five was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Blood Demon members were merely ordinary Deity Kings, not even Supernal Deity Kings. To him, they were like ants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, these ants had somehow managed to use the Hudson family's deadly forbidden technique to block his full-force attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened. "Damn it! This is just a desperate struggle! No matter how strong your defense is, it will eventually break! And how long can you sustain this, you pathetic insects?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Hudson family's forbidden technique consumes life force! Once activated, your bodies will drain like a funnel until your life force is exhausted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Icy Five commanded, "Everyone, attack together! Smash through their defense! We will eliminate the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Dark Deity Legion began to converge, launching a frenzied assault to shatter the Veil of Despair and obliterate Anastasia and her friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faces of the Blood Demon members flushed red as they struggled to maintain their formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were still just peak Deity Kings, not even Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing tens of thousands, even millions of enemies who were at or above their cultivation level, they realized that even combining their efforts in the Draconic Formation wouldn't be enough to hold the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, more dragon phantoms surged into the sky, multiplying with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Jethro's command, hundreds of thousands of Hudson warriors joined the fray, unleashing the Draconic Formation without hesitation. Regardless of their cultivation levels, they stood shoulder to shoulder, creating an even more formidable Veil of Despair, a wall of shifting dragon silhouettes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This massive barrier spanned nearly half the battlefield, standing firm against the relentless assaults of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The storm of attacks crashed down upon the Veil of Despair, shaking it violently, yet it held firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every Hudson warrior wore a solemn expression, pouring their life force into erecting this unbreakable wall of defense for the Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Jethro's voice rang across the battlefield like a clarion call. "All soldiers of the Human Community, listen up! The God of Light is not dead! She will return soon! The Human Community has not been defeated! We still have a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, fall back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat to the final line of defense at Peaks City! Trust me, if we endure, victory will certainly shine upon us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Light will return!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night will also come back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ultimately, victory belongs to the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's urgent cries echoed in every Human Alliance soldier's ears, but their faces were etched with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They mused, "The God of Light isn't dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could that be possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she were alive, why isn't she here helping us? We have all witnessed her grievous injuries and seen her hurled into the Sanctum of Light, watched in horror as it collapsed around her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That incredible explosion was enough to shatter even the Sanctum of Light! How could the God of Light possibly survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Human Alliance still was stagnant, Jethro's anxiety peaked. More than a million Hudson soldiers were simultaneously employing the deadly forbidden technique, the Draconic Formation, but against the vastly </span><span>larger</span><span> numbers of the Dark Deity Legion, it wouldn't hold for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Draconic Formation broke, the Human Alliance would be doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fall back! Retreat now!" Finally, a few soldiers snapped to attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only a handful were willing to surrender. As long as there was even a glimmer of hope for victory, they'd rather fight tooth and nail than throw in the towel or meet their end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with over a million Hudson soldiers sacrificing themselves to cast the Draconic Formation, it was the perfect moment to pull back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they began to retreat, more and more soldiers from the Human Alliance joining them as they sought refuge back to Peaks City, aiming to safeguard their final defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion attacked relentlessly, crashing against the shield formed by the Draconic Formation, which trembled but did not shatter. Each Hudson family warrior burned their life force, desperately maintaining the integrity of their nearly invincible defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to their resilience, even more of the Human Alliance pulled back, finding safety behind the dragon-shaped barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Five seethed as he observed the unfolding scene, his anger swelling. "Damn it! Hudson warriors, your valor is commendable! Sacrificing yourselves to protect the Human Alliance... But alas, your efforts are destined to be in vain! Once I'm through with you, the entire Human Alliance will meet its end!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
