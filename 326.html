  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne put all the other combat drones into the Dimensional Space. Just as he finished all this, several figures quickly appeared on the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were none other than Ryan, Nathan and Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Further away, there were two figures hiding in the darkness. They should be the Class A- elders of The Wise Order from the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle that took place two miles away ended quickly, leaving the passengers on the Alisa Ship unaware of what had happened. However, for true experts, even the cries of agony from two miles away could be faintly heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan and his companions rushed over to investigate the situation after hearing the screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they reached the deck, they found that Osborne had already arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, in a state of astonishment and doubt, exclaimed, "Could it be another pirate attack? Damn, they are getting too audacious! Do they really think the Augustine family is easy to bully?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face looked gloomy, but he didn't say anything. Instead, he scanned the dim sea. His eyesight was very good, and Ryan actually saw the dozen or so pirate ships left behind two miles away, as well as the hundreds of pirates who fell on the ships, with no scars on their faces but already dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of surprise suddenly appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pirates!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're all dead!" Ryan pointed into the distance and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan and Yulissa both wore expressions of surprise. However, in such dim lighting, their vision couldn't reach that far. Fortunately, they quickly fetched a telescope to get a clear view of the distant situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of those dead pirates was fully armed, and even had a dozen rocket launchers scattered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, expressions of fear appeared on their faces. If these pirates hadn't been eliminated and had gotten a bit closer, launching their rockets together...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Alisa Ship would definitely be severely damaged!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, it was unknown how many tourists would be injured or even die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Alisa Ship also had to be towed back to the shipyard, and they did not know how much it would cost to repair it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were expressions of shock on the faces of the three, and they all looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's going on?" Nathan asked. The pirates would naturally not die for no reason. The most likely reason was that Osborne, who arrived before them, took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly, "They were just a group of ordinary pirates, attempting to attack the Alisa Ship, but I discovered them in advance and killed them effortlessly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them gasped as they heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne spoke with understatement, they were well aware of the difficulty in accomplishing these tasks. Firstly, the pirates' ships were small and close to the dim and vast sea surface, making it difficult to detect them. By the time they noticed, the pirates had already entered striking range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the reason why the Augustine family's ships had an accident before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how careful the escort team was, it was difficult to avoid a group of pirates who wanted nothing more than to blow up the ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne discovered this group of pirates in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he detect them, but he also effortlessly dealt with the pirates, eliminating them two miles away, without giving them any opportunity to attack the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There wasn't even much noise. If the pirates' screams hadn't faintly reached their ears, they wouldn't even know what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, how did you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Yulissa's face was full of curiosity, and she looked at his eyes with great surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time she went out to sea, she was also attacked by pirates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, it was only after the pirate attack that the escort team and Yulissa discovered the pirates. After a fierce battle, the ship was nearly destroyed, the escort team suffered heavy losses, and she herself narrowly escaped death on the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, facing the same situation, Osborne solved it easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was very curious about how he did it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemies were all dead two miles away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that Osborne used his powers to kill all the enemies, but what kind of power could attack at a distance of two miles?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary Class A masters could not do this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the two Class A- elders from the Augustine family in the dark looked at each other with shock in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because they couldn't kill the enemy from two miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "How did I do that? Yulissa, they are just ordinary pirates, so you can just kill them casually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Yulissa, Ryan and Nathan were all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he casually kill them off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a distance of two miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't know that Osborne had a combat drone, so they thought wrongly, thinking that it was Osborne who took action personally, and looked at him in surprise and doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had long since acknowledged his strength and were in awe of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just because Osborne had once defeated them single-handedly in a four-on-one battle, but also because he had effortlessly dealt with Yohan and forced Lauren to jump into the sea with just one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they did not know his true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even did not know what kind of powers Osborne possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he could control other people's attacks in turn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, Nathan's Boiling Sea of Fire was counter-controlled by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, Queenie's Mind-control Arrow was also controlled by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another simple example was that Yohan's thunder was also controlled by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all suspected that Osborne's power was to control the attacks of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard they racked their brains, they could never know that the reason Osborne was able to counter-control those attacks was simply because he had the fire elemental essence and lightning elemental essence within him, along with stronger manipulation abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his mind control was stronger than Queenie's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, you guys guard the Alisa Ship. I'm leaving for a while! The leader of those pirates has escaped. I need to catch up and find their lair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as we catch them, we may be able to get information about the mastermind behind this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, Osborne was ready to take action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
