Prepare a fake transfer contract to make it look like we're handing over the diamond mine. Then we'll strike when the time is right!" Derek sneered with a cruel smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes burned with a seething rage. "They killed my son, and I won't let them off easy. Let them enjoy their moment of triumph before plunging them into despair. I can't wait to see the look on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to make them suffer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's flay them alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling finality, Derek's orders were swiftly executed, and his men set to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the convoy from </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services rolled into the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything appeared calm on the surface, but Valentin and the others were on high alert, gripping their weapons tightly, fully aware of the danger they were stepping into.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Chevalier family was no ordinary clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With nearly a millennium of history, their influence in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> was immense, wielding power in both the shadows and the light. They were a force to be reckoned with, far beyond anything </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security Services could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wrong move could spell disaster for them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, the area is secure," Valentin reported.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, donning a lifelike mask, stepped out of the vehicle, his demeanor calm yet resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek was waiting, flanked by a handful of sharp-eyed men, each exuding an air of lethal competence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne emerged, Derek's gaze darkened, a flicker of cold hatred igniting within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the man who had taken his son, Apollo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek longed to exact his revenge right then and there, to make Osborne pay in the most excruciating way, but he restrained himself, fixing his icy stare on his adversary instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought you'd actually show up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged nonchalantly. "Why wouldn't I? According to our agreement, the Chevalier family has lost ownership of this diamond mine to me. This is a </span><span>ten-billion-dollar asset, and I'm here to claim what's mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's eyes narrowed. "Very well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As an ancient family, we pride ourselves on our integrity. Since you've come to accept the mine, I'll oblige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just make sure you're alive to sign it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied with a smirk, "Let's skip the pleasantries and get right to the transfer agreement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, no problem," Derek replied, a sinister smile creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clapped his hands, and one of his men stepped forward with the transfer document, handing it over to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly scanned the contract before passing it to Valentin for a closer look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's expression shifted to one of alarm as he leaned in to whisper to Osborne, his voice barely above a murmur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled coldly, "It seems, Mr. Chevalier, that you're not quite ready to part with the mine after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The terms of this agreement seem fine, but the ink is a special kind that will fade in a matter of hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, everything written here will vanish, rendering this contract meaningless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's face paled, disbelief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected his little ruse to be so easily uncovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his eyes flared with a more intense fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had planned to let you enjoy a brief moment of happiness before you faced your doom. But since you've caught on, I'll cut to the chase and send you on your way sooner than anticipated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! You think I'd hand over a ten-billion-dollar diamond mine just after you killed my son? Ha! Do you take the Chevalier family for fools?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, you'll all meet your end here. I'll personally snap your neck and flay your skin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Derek's furious words echoed through the mine, a terrifying aura erupted around him. A roaring blaze instantly enveloped his body, transforming him into a massive fireball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense heat radiated throughout the entire diamond mine, causing even his subordinates to retreat a good distance, too wary to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class B+, fire elemental metahuman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with surprise. Among all elemental powers, the fire was renowned for its sheer ferocity and wide-ranging destruction&mdash;arguably even more explosive than lightning elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had long desired to absorb the essence of a fire elemental to amplify his own powers but had never encountered one until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Derek to be a fire elemental metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze fixed on Derek like he was eyeing a hidden treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smirk, he said, "Mr. Chevalier, ready to fight already? You're quite impatient. But honestly, thinking a Class B+ fire elemental metahuman could kill me? You're </span><span>underestimating me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek sneered coldly, "Confident, aren't you? Too bad for you, today's your end! Not even a Class A power master could save you now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the entire mine trembled as a wave of fearsome energy burst forth from the tunnels. Powerful figures emerged from the darkness, their numbers totaling over three hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They surrounded Osborne and his team, their eyes icy and full of lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin and the others were taken aback, their faces paling in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had anticipated an ambush, but the sheer scale of the threat before him still took him aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy fluctuations alone revealed the strength of his opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense three Class B+ levels of power and over ten Class B levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a hundred warriors above Class C stood ready&mdash;truly a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer scale of their might was terrifying.</span></p><div class="pagination">
