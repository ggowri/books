  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana casually struck, directly crushing Dalia. Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't believe Dalia just died like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia was a warrior of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. In the Phantomagic Realm, she was nearly invincible. Out of hundreds of thousands of warriors who reached Empyrean Sacredness and entered the Phantomagic Realm, only a few thousand managed to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's view, Dalia should have already reached the peak of Empyrean Sacredness and could break through at any moment to become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness super warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, she was easily crushed to death by Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was also just a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Could the strength gap at this cultivation level really be that vast?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Primordial was shocked. He said to Osborne, "Osborne, this woman is extraordinary! I didn&rsquo;t notice before, but the Sacred Power within her is incredibly pure. She&rsquo;s the one who could break through to become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness at any moment!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness cultivation level, there are probably very few who can defeat her with sheer strength. Even in the deeper parts of the universe, she would definitely be considered a super genius!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That monster Dalia is nothing compared to her! No wonder she was easily crushed... However, even though Dalia's body exploded, she&rsquo;s not dead yet! That body was just her puppet; her true strength lies in her soul!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne looked toward Dalia in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw a semi-transparent monstrous figure still standing there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a giant monster resembling an octopus, but with more tentacles, more terrifying, and uglier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, it was merely a soul, glaring angrily at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You deserve to die! Die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia shouted angrily, "I'll kill you! I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana reached out her hand again and gently grabbed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Dalia couldn't continue speaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her soul was also seized by Adriana's Sacred Power giant hand. Osborne noticed that it was a massive hand purely formed by condensed Sacred Power. He realized Adriana hadn't used the power of any Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said calmly, "You have strong soul power, but it's too mixed! Relying on devouring others' power will never make you a true warrior! You demonic cultivators progress quickly in the early stages, but later on, that cultivation method has many drawbacks. So, your power is hardly worth mentioning."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that Adriana's words were not just directed at Dalia but also at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's heart stirred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is Adriana worried that I might take the path of a demonic cultivator to quickly gain power?" Thinking of this, Osborne felt a bit warm inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana continued, "Whether it's a demonic cultivator or a virtuous cultivator, it's just a different way of gaining power. Some demonic cultivators aren't evil... but you schemed to massacre hundreds of thousands of Empyrean Sacredness warriors, an unforgivable crime!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, disappear forever!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana's Sacred Power palm pressed down with force again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia felt the true breath of death and shouted loudly, "Don't kill me! Don't kill me! I can be useful to you. I'm willing to be your slave, I'm willing to work for you! Just spare me..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not necessary! I have no interest in someone like you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana completely ignored Dalia's pleas, and the Sacred Power palm clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a crack, Dalia's soul was instantly crushed and vanished into the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia was completely dead, entirely vanished from the world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana turned to look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you okay?" Adriana asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne completely relaxed and quickly nodded. "I'm fine! That monster didn't hurt me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana gave a faint smile. "That's good! Hundreds of thousands of Empyrean Sacredness warriors were slaughtered by that demonic cultivator, leaving only a few thousand survivors, and yet you're still alive and completely unharmed. It's truly a miracle. I knew I wasn't wrong about you. You not only have strength and skill but also incredible luck!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the future, I might need your help."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked a bit embarrassed. "I'm just lucky, that's all. My strength is nothing compared to yours, not even worth mentioning! But if I ever have the ability to help you in the future, I definitely won't refuse!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You saved me again, thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sincerely expressed his thanks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, I should be the one thanking you! If it weren't for your information, I wouldn't have come here. And without that, I wouldn't have been able to kill that demonic cultivator!" Adriana said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Speaking of this, Adriana waved her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her hand appeared a Dimensional Bag. It was Dalia's Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This demonic cultivator may not be very strong, but he's quite wealthy! There are several Supreme Sacred Artifacts inside, and even more Legendary Sacred Artifacts. Besides, there are plenty of Sacred Crystals and various resources here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, I guess I made a fortune!" Adriana said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana put away the Dimensional Bag. "I killed the person, so I won't share this Dimensional Bag with you. Don't blame me for being stingy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly said, "Adriana, these are your spoils of war. Even if you share them with me, I can't accept them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, Osborne had already obtained Dalia's best items.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had taken all ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne didn't say these words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns drained the power of the Phantomagic Realm, with a great chance of merging and transforming into an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Imperial Artifacts are too precious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne trusted Adriana, he wouldn't reveal it easily. After all, the temptation was too great, and if Adriana became interested in the Bewitching Lanterns, it would be troublesome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, you must be tired, right? Go back and rest! I won't stay any longer. I still need to rush back to Racial Convergence Planet to handle some matters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Adriana prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and took out a few jadeflare vials.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These jadeflare vials contained Dragon Elixir, most of which were Top-grade Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, there were over a thousand drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost everyone who entered the Phantomagic Realm was killed by Dalia, but Osborne obtained their Dimensional Bags.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Dimensional Bags contained plenty of Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dimensional Bags of those over twenty warriors who reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection contained a large amount of Top-grade Dragon Elixir, and even Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out a thousand drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and two hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Ms. Alba, this is Dragon Elixir. Consuming it can help you enter the Enlightenment State and boost your strength. I hope it&rsquo;s useful to you! If you can&rsquo;t finish it, please pass it on to Isa and Clarissa for me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana paused for a moment, then gave a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've heard of these Legendary Dragon Elixirs before, but I've never seen them. For me right now, they are indeed still useful. However, twenty drops are enough for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll pass the rest on to them for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, thank you for your kindness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana finished speaking, took all the Dragon Elixirs, and waved at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Adriana disappeared in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked in the direction where she disappeared, his face full of longing. He murmured, "When will I be as strong as Ms. Alba?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But for now, figuring out how to save my parents is more important!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
