  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's voice came through the communicator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm already in Frost Peak City! When are you gonna get here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a faint smile. "I'll arrive tomorrow morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara nodded and continued, "Frost Peak City's a madhouse right now! I've never seen so many powerful warriors of the same level all in one place. A bunch of people have asked me to join their teams, saying they'd give me tens of thousands of Sacred Crystals if I lent them a hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Did you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not! I already promised to team up with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft laugh. "But I won't give you any Sacred Crystals, not even a single one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want your Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Then why do you want to team up with me? What's in it for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara said calmly, "A chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, I don't know those other people well. I don't wanna team up with them! Anyway, during the state duel, I'll do my best to help you get a better ranking. If we rack up enough points... then help me get a good ranking too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne talked with Clara for a bit before ending the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a day went by. The Mystic Sirius Sect's warship took off once again, with cheers from numerous sect disciples ringing in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Danilo of Peak One and Angela of Peak Seven were still in charge of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were making their way to Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frost Peak City was quite a distance from Tempest Fortress City. So, their warship only reached Tempest Fortress City. From there, they had to use the Translocator in Tempest Fortress City to get to Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, the group of five arrived in Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frost Peak City was blanketed in snow throughout the year. It was a gorgeous winter paradise, and the city was extremely bustling. Since it was the location for the state duel, everyone who wanted to watch had flocked here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spotted all kinds of peculiar creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tempest Fortress City was predominantly inhabited by the Human Community, so the majority of its residents were humans. However, the entire Zephyr State boasted a hundred cities and was home to hundreds of different races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the more powerful ones were the Human Community, the Ember Phoenix Clan, the Stellary Wolf Clan, and the Ebony Sheep Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head to the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's where the Zephyr State officials have arranged accommodations for the state duel participants!" Angela announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they found themselves in front of a massive complex. A glistening plaque hung above the main building, bearing the words: [Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, a continuous stream of warriors was going in and out of the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex, each exuding an intimidating aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne, Bethan, and Jamar completed the registration process, they each got a badge and a key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendant at the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex informed, "Osborne, you're ranked 108th on the state duel strength list. Your accommodation is in Zone One, Courtyard 8.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bethan, you're ranked 825th. Your place to stay is in Zone Eight, Courtyard 25.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jamar, you're ranked 950th. You'll be staying in Zone Nine, Courtyard 50.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback by what the attendant said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We are going to be staying in different places?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It seems that our accommodations are directly tied to our positions on the strength list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Apparently, the higher one's ranking, the better the accommodation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't resist asking, "Where do the top 100 ranked participants stay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendant flashed a smile and replied, "The top 100 all reside in the Celestial Zone. Each of them is assigned to a courtyard there according to their ranking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is clearly a form of discrimination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But in this world, the strong reign supreme. The higher your rank, the more powerful you are, and naturally, you should enjoy better living quarters. This kind of arrangement also helps to fuel the competitive spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Those with lower rankings will surely be more motivated to prove themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. First, let's get settled in," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the key in hand, Osborne made his way deep into the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex. Soon, he realized that the entire complex was built on a magnificent mountain peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zone Nine was located at the foot of the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one ascended the mountain, there came Zone Eight, Zone Seven, Zone Six, Zone Five...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each zone boasted hundreds of courtyards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The courtyard allocated to Osborne was Courtyard 8 in Zone One, situated nearly at the mountain's peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above Zone One lay an even more opulent and vast expanse of courtyards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the Celestial Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perched right at the summit of the mountain, the Celestial Zone seemed to be saturated with a denser concentration of the world's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gazed up at the courtyards in the Celestial Zone and couldn't help but let out a little sigh. He was just eight ranks shy of making it into the top hundred and earning a place in the Celestial Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he didn't really let it bother him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The state duel strength rankings were nothing but numbers. Defeating someone with a higher ranking didn't hold much weight either. The ultimate victory would be decided in the state duel itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne located Courtyard 8 in Zone One. He inserted the key to deactivate the defensive formation and stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he entered than several figures materialized from the neighboring courtyards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were three men and two women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like another one's joined Zone One," one of them remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Courtyard 8! Let me take a look at the strength rankings... The one ranked 108th is named Osborne Augustine. He's from the Mystic Sirius Sect in Tempest Fortress City. Wow! He's actually the city duel champion of Tempest Fortress City!" The woman's face lit up with surprise as she finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A champion from Tempest Fortress City? This could be tricky. Champions are usually full of pride. Even though Tempest Fortress City isn't that powerful, I'm afraid he won't be willing to join our team and play a supporting role for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the group frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, let's give it a shot and invite him first. We can offer a hefty sum. If he turns us down... well, we'll figure something else out. He's only ranked 108th. It won't make or break the state duel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, Gustave Fanny, nodded. "Quintina, go and knock on the door. We'll have a chat with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, Gustave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman called Quintina Hobson strolled over to Osborne's courtyard. She channeled her power and sent a gentle jolt through the defensive formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne swung open the courtyard door, looking at the five strangers with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I help you?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave flashed a smile and said, "Hey, Osborne! I'm Gustave Fanny. Sorry to intrude. We're here to invite you to join my team. As long as you lend me a hand in the state duel, regardless of my final ranking, I'll fork over 50 thousand Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if I make it into the top ten, the reward doubles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've just arrived in Frost Peak City and barely settled in, and already someone's trying to recruit me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">From what Gustave's saying, he wants me to play second-fiddle and help him break into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And if he does, I'll pocket 100 thousand Sacred Crystals? That's mighty generous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sized up Gustave and quickly rummaged through his memory of the strength rankings to confirm the man's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave hailed from the Ember Phoenix Clan and was a disciple of the Luminary Plume Sect, a Second-rate Power in Frost Peak City. In the Frost Peak City duel, he'd clinched the third-place spot. Given Frost Peak City's overall might, his position on the strength rankings was higher than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave was ranked 103rd!</span></p><div class="pagination">
