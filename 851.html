  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was at a loss for words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Level Four Realm? Seriously?" he thought. "Most Class S Lesser Gods can't even dream of reaching a Level Four Realm in their lifetime.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I don't really get how these Realm levels work, but from what the God of Star said, my Light Realm used to be Level Three, and now it's Level Four? That's way beyond what most Class S Lesser Gods manage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But I don't feel like I did anything special to make this happen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like this Level Four Light Realm just comes with my light powers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Where did these light powers even come from?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If most Lesser Gods can't hit a Level Four Realm, but mine just comes with it, could it mean my light powers were godly from the start? That would make sense."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's brow furrowed. He wondered, &ldquo;But Isa gave me these light powers. How did Isa get her hands on godly light powers? I've got to ask her about this next time I see her."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne asked, "God of Star, is a Level Four Light Realm very strong?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star smiled, "Oh, it's definitely strong. But remember, the strongest force is always the person, not the Realm. Your own strength is what truly matters.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, it seems you're not very clear about Realm levels. Let me give you a quick rundown. Realm is an advanced application of powers. All powers ultimately manifest their strength through Realms.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The levels of Realm are Primary Realm, Level Two Realm, Level Three Realm, Level Four Realm, Level Five Realm, and Level Six Realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Primary Realm is just the beginning. The power forming the Realm is very scattered, like a sandcastle. A bit more power and the whole Realm could crumble.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Level Two Realm is where the powers start to connect, like strands of rope. The Realm becomes less prone to collapse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Level Three Realm is where these strands are woven together in a crisscross pattern, much like weaving fabric. The Realm is now quite solid and resistant to breaking.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Level Four Realm takes it a step further, where the power forms a solid plate of iron. Even someone a whole tier above you would find it hard to shatter your Realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Level Five Realm is even stronger, like steel that has been forged through countless trials. It's generally a level only true deities can reach.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And Level Six Realm is said to be the pinnacle. The power of the Realm merges with space-time itself, becoming intangible and invisible. Ordinary means can't break it, and only a deity of the highest order can achieve such a level.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The higher the Realm, the greater the boost to your power and the stronger the suppression it exerts on your enemies. Of course, it also demands more from your mental strength. Even though you've mastered a Level Four Light Realm, your current level is too low to sustain it for long periods.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, be cautious when using Light Realm."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star's words left Osborne with an expression of sheer amazement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Realms went up to Level Six.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By this standard, even though his Light Realm was Level Four, his Thunder Realm, Space Realm, and Spirit Realm were still only Primary, not even reaching Level Two.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, God of Star, for clearing that up," Osborne said sincerely.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With God of Star's explanation, it would be much easier for him to improve his Realm levels in the future, at least avoiding some missteps.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God of Star smiled, "No need for such formality. You helped me immensely by taking down Dark Deity. Otherwise, once he escaped, he would have come straight for me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, let's move on. I'll teach you some offensive techniques for your light elemental power!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face lit up with excitement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The attack methods of a light elemental? He knew that his current mastery of Dissolving Light had become insufficient.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to teach you my own techniques. They're called Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays. Relax your body, don't resist!" God of Star said, his voice brimming with enthusiasm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, God of Star's finger jabbed sharply at Osborne's forehead.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, an invisible stream of information surged into Osborne's mind. He was flooded with vivid scenes&mdash;God of Star himself demonstrating Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Using mental strength to transfer information!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could use this method too, but he never thought it could be used to teach combat skills to others. His eyes went wide with surprise.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the images he saw, the God of Star's Destruction Orbs exploded into bright lights, covering a huge area. Anything that touched them was wiped out instantly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Disintegration Rays were like a supercharged version of Dissolving Light. Tons of rays shot out, easily breaking through enemy defenses, shattering their Realms, and disintegrating their bodies. It was seriously powerful.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was amazed. "The Destruction Orbs are insanely strong! And the Disintegration Rays&mdash;just as intense!"</p><div class="pagination">
