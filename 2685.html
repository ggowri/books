  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "You're so smart! You guessed it right!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne widened his eyes, feeling a bit incredulous. "Are you talking about these Soulbane Parasites?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right," Primordial said calmly. "I told you before. The explosion of the Chaotic World was like a singularity bursting open, forming the cosmos. In every corner of the cosmos, various creatures were born.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Due to the different environments of their birth, these creatures vary in form, type, and strength, but they can generally be categorized as Carbon-based Lifeform, Silicon-based Lifeform, and Singular Lifeform."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps because Adriana was here, Primordial showed off his knowledge again, recounting the birth of the cosmos and the various types of creatures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was already very familiar with this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued, "Among them, Carbon-based Lifeforms are the most numerous, the smartest, and can elevate their life level more quickly. So, they gradually took control of vast Stellar Regions, galaxies, and star clusters."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, in the cosmos, there is still no absolute Master. Every powerful being and every powerful race desires to dominate the cosmos. Thus, the Cosmic Tempestuous Battle erupted."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Cosmic Tempestuous Battle occurred over hundreds of times. Some lasted hundreds of thousands or millions of years, while others stretched for billions. However, there were no winners in the Cosmic Tempestuous Battle, nor could anyone defeat all opponents to truly dominate the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Later, Empress Kira was born, becoming the queen of the Bug Clan and leading them to launch another Cosmic Tempestuous Battle. That battle was called the Cosmic Ultimatum Battle because the result was Empress Kira's Bug Clan defeating the Beast Clan, Spirit Clan, Plant Clan, Silicon-based Lifeforms, and Singular Lifeforms, emerging as the ultimate winner."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Empress Kira became the first Master of the cosmos, ruling for countless ages, until the Spirit Clan's warriors, together with warriors from other races, defeated Empress Kira."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, these are not very relevant to what we are discussing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Empress Kira became the first Master of the cosmos not only because of her unmatched strength at the time and the power of the Bug Clan but also due to the Soulbane Parasite."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although the Soulbane Parasite seemed inconspicuous, it played an immensely significant role in the Cosmic Ultimatum Battle, as it could parasitize any creature's Soul Current Ocean, suppress their consciousness, manipulate their memories, and control their bodies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At the most critical moment of the Cosmic Ultimatum Battle, warriors from other races were shocked to discover that many of their own had long been parasitized and controlled by the Soulbane Parasite."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Soulbane Parasite took control of their bodies at crucial moments, causing heavy casualties among the warriors of various races, ultimately leading to their defeat by Empress Kira and the Bug Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It was also due to the parasitic ability of the Soulbane Parasite that Empress Kira and the Bug Clan were able to rule the cosmos for ages. Much later, other races finally discovered a way to counter the Soulbane Parasite. Eventually, they joined forces to defeat Empress Kira and became the next Master."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The way to counter the Soulbane Parasite was the Undying Flame, which only the warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan could wield."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After hearing Primordial's words, Osborne and Adriana were completely shocked."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To them, these secrets of the cosmos felt too distant."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Primordial hadn't spoken, they would never have known these secrets."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana bit her lower lip, feeling extremely distressed. 'Is the Soulbane Parasite really that terrifying? Once parasitized by the Soulbane Parasite, can only the Ember Phoenix Clan's Undying Flame resolve it? Does that mean May can't be saved?'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Soulbane Parasite, which only the Ember Phoenix Clan's Undying Flame can resolve, is absolutely beyond their ability to handle, and they simply cannot eliminate the Soulbane Parasite."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Aside from the Ember Phoenix Clan's Undying Flame, nothing else can resolve the Soulbane Parasite. In a way, they are practically immortal beings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fortunately, they themselves have no real power and can only parasitize in other creatures' Soul Current Ocean, controlling others' strength. Otherwise, they would cause even greater trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, can we only kill May and imprison the Soulbane Parasite? Or should we directly imprison May?" Adriana's eyes were filled with pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"May was the person she trusted and was closest to. Moreover, May was the one who raised her with her own hands. But now, she had no ability to save May. How could she not feel heartbroken?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But at this moment, Osborne frowned and said, 'Perhaps we have another way.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Immediately, Adriana looked at Osborne in surprise. 'What way?'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne shook his head. 'I'm not sure if this method will work. I can only say we have a bit of hope. I can only try to find out.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, even Primordial looked at Osborne in surprise. 'You have a way? Osborne, the only nemesis of the Soulbane Parasite is the Undying Flame of the Ember Phoenix Clan, and it's impossible for a warrior of the Ember Phoenix Clan who wields the Undying Flame to come to the edge of the cosmos. What way could you possibly have?'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you thinking of seeking out that Ember Phoenix Clan girl? I'm telling you, she can't help you. She's too weak."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana looked at Osborne in surprise. 'Who is the Ember Phoenix Clan girl?'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She narrowed her eyes, her gaze filled with danger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne was speechless, knowing Adriana was getting jealous again, so he quickly explained, 'She's Agnes. You've met her. She went with Angela and me to Stellar Region M72 to save my parents. However, Agnes is her alias, and her real name is Agatha.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's the one who awakened the Dark Phoenix Bloodline during the state duel in Zephyr State and almost defeated me, Agatha."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana was a bit surprised. 'So she's the Dark Phoenix. Turns out, you saved the Dark Phoenix. Even I wasn't confident in defeating those mysterious warriors who were hunting her back then, yet you managed to save her. Do you think she can save May?'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She put away the jealousy on her face."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne shook his head. 'The method I mentioned has nothing to do with her. I have another way.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial looked at Osborne in confusion. 'Osborne, don't you understand what I'm saying? I've already told you. The only nemesis of the Soulbane Parasite is the Undying Flame of the Ember Phoenix Clan. That's something we absolutely cannot obtain.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, May let out a cold laugh."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looking at Primordial, she said coldly, 'You Plant Clan people sure know a lot. You even know about the great achievements of the Soulbane Parasite Clan. That's right! The Soulbane Parasite Clan is just that powerful.'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Except for the Undying Flame of the Ember Phoenix Clan, no one can defeat the Soulbane Parasite Clan. I won't die. Don't think you can pull me out of her Soul Current Ocean. Even if you completely crush her body, I still won't die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At most, you can only imprison me. If you want to save her, you'd better obediently listen to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe, when I'm in a better mood, I won't completely crush her consciousness. Once I find a better host, I'll naturally leave her Soul Current Ocean. By then, she'll be fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May's expression was full of disdain. "So, you'd better release me quickly and obediently help me find a better host. Otherwise, she's doomed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Adriana clenched her fists, her expression growing even more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne couldn't help but laugh and said, "Who says only the Ember Phoenix Clan's Undying Flame can counter the Soulbane Parasite Clan? I know someone. She's definitely your nemesis."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May roared, "That's impossible!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
