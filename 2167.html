  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the reflection of the water mirror, Ricky was horrified to see his once youthful skin now wrinkled and his hair turned white, as if he had aged tenfold in an instant. No longer the robust middle-aged man he once was, he now looked like a frail old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted in rage, a terrifying killing intent radiating from him, threatening to consume everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time, you're dead meat!" he bellowed, knowing full well that the source of his predicament was that devastating lash from the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That whip, a projection of the River of Time, had done more than just strike him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had siphoned away a significant portion of his lifespan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky realized that with each hit, he was losing years, transforming from a vibrant middle-aged warrior into a decrepit elder. If he were to endure even a few more strikes from the Whip of Time, he could very well die of old age right here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, he was supposed to enjoy a long life, with plenty of time ahead of him. But now, because of the Whip of Time, his precious time was being stolen away, and his lifespan was rapidly dwindling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he not be furious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lifespan wasn't something one could easily replenish. To regain his youth, Ricky would either need to break through to a higher cultivation level&mdash;since the higher his level, the longer his life&mdash;or he would have to find some rare Sacred Elixirs that could restore his vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those were hard to come by, and the thought of living with this aged face for a long time made Ricky seethe with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you!" Ricky ground his teeth and shouted at the God of Time again, though he dared not act recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he unleashed his divine power, enveloping himself in layers of defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky even pulled out several Apex divine artifacts, positioning them in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he couldn't afford to take a direct hit from the Whip of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weapon wasn't just powerful; its speed was uncanny, making it nearly impossible to evade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky was left with no choice but to brace for impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he couldn't withstand it, his lifespan would plummet, a consequence he simply could not accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he had surrounded himself with five or six Apex divine artifacts, Ricky felt a bit more at ease. He fixed his icy glare on the God of Time, inhaling deeply before speaking, "Your skills are impressive. You can use the River of Time's projection to drain my lifespan! I'm giving you a chance: restore my life, and I'll let you go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't even get involved in this matter anymore; I'll just walk away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time let out a cold laugh. "Restore your lifespan? Dream on! Even if I could, I wouldn't lift a finger to help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's expression darkened, his teeth grinding as he spat. "You little brat, you're asking for it! If you won't cooperate, I'll make you wish you had! No matter how powerful your Whip of Time is, if you can't hit me, it's useless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I catch you, you'll be at my mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious shout, Ricky launched his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hands, summoning a tidal wave that surged toward the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time scoffed and swung the Whip of Time with precision, striking the incoming waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whip shattered the tidal wave, sending it crashing apart before it lashed out at Ricky, instantly breaking one of his Apex divine artifacts into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's face contorted in pain, a deep sense of loss washing over him as he watched the remnants of his artifact scatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had plenty of Apex divine artifacts, but even they couldn't withstand the relentless assault for long. Each artifact had cost him a fortune to acquire, and losing them to the God of Time would be a devastating blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, after shattering one of his artifacts, the Whip of Time was finally blocked, sparing him from further harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Now let's see what else you've got! Die!" he taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surging waves were lashed apart by the Whip of Time, yet they swiftly converged once more. With even greater speed, they bore down on the God of Time like an avalanche, a colossal mass of water crashing towards her in an all-encompassing onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time's face darkened with resolve as she snapped her whip once more, the air crackling with menacing energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening roar reverberated through the area, like thunderclaps echoing across a storm-tossed sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each fierce lash, the towering waves that had been relentlessly surging forward were shredded apart, their foamy crests exploding into a fine mist that hung in the air. But the toll of such a furious onslaught was evident. The God of Time no longer had the strength to spare for an offensive against Ricky. Instead, she was reduced to a desperate defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky laughed coldly. "Is this all you can do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how tricky the Whip of Time is, it </span><span>works only when it</span><span> hit</span><span>s</span><span> me! If we were at the same cultivation level, </span><span>I</span><span>'d be running for the hills! But here you are, floundering like a fish out of water!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just give up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His relentless assault intensified, waves crashing and rising to engulf her. The God of Time swung her whip again, breaking through the waves, but they kept coming, inching closer and closer to submerging her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Sweat trickled down her forehead as she struggled against the mounting pressure, her resolve hardening as she bit her lip, refusing to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Human Alliance watched in growing dread as the tide turned against the God of Time. Faces filled with worry and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over! God of Time can't hold on much longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn that Lord Malevolence! He has so many powerful allies! An Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King? Only the God of Night could step in and turn the tide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time has already done remarkably well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She can't hold on any longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really hopeless for the Human Community? Besides that Ascension Eight</span><span> warrior</span><span>, there are still six Ascension Seven warriors left! How can we fight this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Alliance was engulfed in despair, while the Dark Deity Legion, witnessing the situation, erupted in cheers and shouts of encouragement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time's face showed signs of exhaustion. Even wielding the projection of the River of Time as her weapon, she struggled to maintain control. Each swing drained her divine power significantly, and she couldn't keep this up for much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things didn't change soon, defeat was imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Time frowned, weighing her options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Should I just run?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ricky's cold voice cut through the air. "Tyrese, you all need to jump in! She might try to escape! Don't let her get away! Someone who can wield time power like this, someone who can summon the River of Time's projection, would be a huge catch for us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surround her and make sure she can't slip away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Tyrese and the other five Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings exchanged glances, and in an instant, they sprang into action, fanning out to encircle the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, their powers intertwined, forming a massive circular shield that enveloped an area spanning tens of thousands of miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too late to escape now!</span></p><div class="pagination">
