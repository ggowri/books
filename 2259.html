  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way back to their quarters, Bethan and Jamar exchanged glances filled with confusion and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear they had something to say, but the words seemed to stick in their throats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan finally blurted </span><span>out</span> <span>,</span><span> communicating telepathically,</span><span> "Osborne is incredibly bold! Betting ten thousand Sacred Crystals on himself to win? Does he really believe he can pull it off? What if he loses? That's enough to buy a top-tier quasi-Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar </span><span>nodded,</span><span> his expression serious. "I'll admit, I don't have the guts to take a risk like that. We're not cut from the same cloth as him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan said, "Still, his confidence is a good thing! Even if he doesn't win, his chances of placing in the top five&mdash;or even the top three&mdash;are definitely looking better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar replied, "True. And if he does well, that increases our odds of winning our bets too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, word of Osborne's audacious wager had spread like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson from Fantasia Isle's expression turned icy. He scoffed and said, "What? The head disciple of Mystic Sirius Sect, Osborne, just bet ten thousand Sacred Crystals on himself to win? What gives him the right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who does this guy think he is? Where does he even get that kind of Sacred Crystal? He's way too overconfident! I can't even say for sure that I'll win, and he's just an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King thinking he can take the crown?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting! Now I can't wait to cross paths with him. I'll show him in the arena just how ridiculous his confidence is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tyson closed his eyes, sinking into a meditative state to prepare for the upcoming duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not too far off, Marreese caught wind of the news and stopped in his tracks for a moment. A sneering smirk, dripping with contempt, spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a clueless idiot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he really think he can take the championship? That's a total joke! Maybe he had a tiny shred of hope in the past, but this year, with Leroy in the picture, he doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell! As long as Leroy doesn't drop the ball, the rest of us, me included, will be scrapping it out for second place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy is a once-in-a-blue-moon talent from Azure Haven Academy! Forget about the city duel; she's a shoo-in for the top ten in the state one, no doubt about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy's ten thousand Sacred Crystals are just going down the drain! But now I'm </span><span>kinda</span><span> intrigued by him. I'm crossing my fingers we'll face off in the arena soon&mdash;I'm dying to see what's giving him all that big-headed confidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Marreese got himself settled and started gearing up for the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in their lodgings, Osborne had just gotten back when he heard Angela calling out to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, come over here a sec!" He veered off and stepped into Angela's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard you placed another bet? Ten thousand in Sacred Crystals? Betting on yourself to win?" Angela's eyes were fixed on him, </span><span>a look of mixed shock and worry</span><span> on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she first got wind of this, she was floored. To her, ten thousand Sacred Crystals was no chump change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to figure out what was going on in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you're not just acting on a whim?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a little smile. "Ms. Olsen, I'm just having a bit of fun with the bets! That ten thousand was from the Sect Tournament winnings. Even if I lose it, it's no biggie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela wrinkled her nose, clearly not buying it. "Is that really how you see it? Or do you actually think you can take the championship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Sure, I've got some self-confidence! If I didn't believe in myself, why would I even bother signing up for the city duel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela could tell that Osborne was beating around the bush and not giving her a straightforward answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> she dug deeper. "Just be honest with me. How confident are you that you'll win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh and was at a loss for words for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>spoke up, trying to be as objective as he could, "I'd say my chances are about fifty-fifty. After all, I haven't gone up against Leroy yet, so I've got no clue about her full strength and abilities. All I know for sure is that she's already mastered Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, when it comes to taking her on, I can only be fifty percent confident at the moment. The same goes for Clara from Fantasia Isle. I haven't seen her in action either, and she could very well stand in my way of winning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's eyes popped in shock as she took in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly hit her that, in Osborne's book, the only real roadblocks to his victory were Leroy and Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he hadn't crossed paths with them yet, he was feeling unsure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Marreese and Tyson? It seemed he didn't see them as serious competition, having already sized up their capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela stared intently at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> her face </span><span>dead serious</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, she finally said, "Alright! I get it now! I just hope you're not all talk. Let me be the first to wish you luck in making it to the top three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and didn't say anything else as he turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela hesitated for a second and then called out, "Come here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Olsen? What's the matter?" a disciple asked, looking confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's ten thousand in Sacred Crystals. Take this to the casino and place a bet on Osborne winning the championship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciple's eyes bulged in disbelief. "Ms. Olsen..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela waved her hand nonchalantly. "Don't even try to talk me out of it! Osborne is my disciple from Peak Seven. If he's bold enough to bet ten thousand Sacred Crystals on himself, why shouldn't I have faith in him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, it's just ten thousand Sacred Crystals. If I lose, I'll just roll up my sleeves and earn them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I win... well, that's a mind-boggling 1.3 million Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That'd be more than enough to deal a heavy financial blow to Azure Haven Academy! And it'd keep me well-supplied with resources for ages."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin spread across Angela's face as she let her imagination run wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her excitement was practically oozing out. "Of course, all this hinges on Osborne actually pulling off a win! If he does, I'll get in touch with Ms. Alba right away and make sure we get Osborne over to Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Angela's eyes were alight with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was completely oblivious to the fact that Angela had also placed a ten-thousand-Sacred-Crystal bet on him. If he'd known, he would've surely given her a </span><span>thumbs</span><span>-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne, he was still deep in thought, musing about how to create more foundational carriers for his Fusion Vessel to tap into greater power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time zipped by, and before long, the day of the city duel rolled around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city duel in Tempest Fortress City was about to get underway, with the draw of lots in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, Tempest Fortress City was home to three Second-rate Powers&mdash;Azure Haven Academy, Fantasia Isle, and Mystic Sirius Sect. Each of these powers had sent ten disciples to take part in the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, hundreds of Third-rate Powers had picked their thirty-four best disciples, bringing the total number of participants in the duel to sixty-four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city duel was scheduled to last six days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, the sixty-four contestants would draw lots to be divided into sixteen groups of four, where they'd go head-to-head. The top performers from each group would move on to the top sixteen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, the top sixteen would face each other, eventually deciding the champions and the top three contenders who'd represent Tempest Fortress City in the state duel.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
