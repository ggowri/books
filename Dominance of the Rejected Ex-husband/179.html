        <h1>Chapter 179</h1>
        <div><p>Charles sighed as he stared back at Tracy. Who was looking at him, like she had done something bad.</p><p>“What happened, why did you stop me?” Charles asked in an unwelcoming tone.</p><p>Tracy gulped and said, “I just want to apologize for what I did, I also abused you and mocked you, thinking you really knelt down to beg the kid for money”.</p><p>Charles scoffed and said, “Really?”</p><p>Tracy nodded quickly. “Yeah. I felt bad for saying all that.”</p><p>“Hold your apology,” Charles said. “I don’t even care what you say about me. Our relationship already ended, so let’s act like that. There’s no point apologizing for bad behavior when you’ll just do it again.”</p><p>Tracy frowned. “Why are you angry at me? I gave you a chance to come back. To continue our happy life. You didn’t. It&#x27;s too late because Collins came into my life.”</p><p>Charles rubbed his hair and laughed dryly. “This is the peak of delusion. I don’t want you again. I will never want you. You are in a relationship with Collins and I don’t care. Drop this pathetic act.”</p><p>Tracy’s eyes hardened. “I know. You always act pathetic and arrogant. You are talented. You have potential. But you keep hanging around women and families that don’t value you. The Moretti family won&#x27;t accept you no matter what you do”</p><p>“None of your business,” Charles said.</p><p>She went quiet for a second, then dipped her hand into her bag and pulled out a thick envelope. “This is ten million dollars. It’s supposed to help you start your life again. You were good at mold crafting during our marriage. I will open an exhibition center for you. You can finally use your life for something.”</p><p>Charles stared at the envelope, not understanding what game she was playing. She really thought such money could bend him. Then she added, “Don’t spend it on women this time.”</p><p>Charles pushed the envelope back. “Hold your fucking money. What are you even doing? I don’t need any of it. Why are you doing this, Tracy?”.</p><p>Her face twisted with anger.  “So, you will still keep acting like this,” Tracy said, her voice rising. “You are poor and nobody, and that tag will follow you around. Serena, and all those ladies are using you for momentum”.</p><p>Charles didn’t reply.</p><p>“You will soon realise” she snapped, “I’m the only one who ever wanted greatness for you. Keep fucking women around. That’s all you are good at. I tried my best”</p><p>With that, she turned and stormed away.</p><p>Charles watched her leave and scoffed. “So stupid. So full of pride”.</p><p>At that moment, Charles’s phone pinged.</p><p>He glanced at the screen.</p><p>LizzyPie: Done. We can move now.</p><p>Charles smirked and typed back.  “Okay.”</p><p>××××</p><p>Meanwhile, at the police station, Mr. Damien stood frozen as the commander-in-chief, Mr. Jay, ordered his release.</p><p>The handcuffs clicked open.</p><p>Mr. Jay stepped in front of him and bowed. “I’m sorry, Mr. Damien.”</p><p>Mr. Damien blinked, confused. At the banquet, this same man had acted like he didn’t even know him. He frowned. “Why did you do that?”</p><p>Mr. Jay straightened and lowered his voice. “You know we had to put on a show. Everyone needed to believe I wasn’t with you. Just drama.”</p><p>Mr. Damien’s lips slowly curved into a smile. “Really?”</p><p>“Yes,” Mr. Jay said calmly. “You can go home. Your seized items and your company will be returned. It was all for shows.”</p><p>Relief flooded Damien. He laughed, he thought he had lost everything,  but it was just a show.</p><p>“Hahaha”, he laughed hysterically “I will be forever grateful. Take sixty tons of gold from my assets. That’s already worth a billion dollars.”</p><p>Mr. Jay smiled. “Sure. Now go immediately before you attract attention.”</p><p>Mr. Damien didn’t waste a second. He rushed out, flagged down a taxi, and said, “Euphoria Hotel.”</p><p>The car pulled away.</p><p>As the city lights passed by, Mr. Damien’s smile faded. His face hardened. Boiling with revenge “I swear I will kill that motherfucker,” he muttered. “Charles. I will show you what I’m made of. You will regret this.”</p><p>The driver spoke calmly, “Really? Maybe you should say that to him directly.”</p><p>Mr. Damien frowned. “Huh?”</p><p>Something in the voice felt wrong. He leaned forward and looked at the driver properly.</p><p>His eyes widened.</p><p>It was her.</p><p>“The woman…” he stammered. “You are the one who helped Charles the other day.”</p><p>LizzyPie’s lips curved into a thin smile.</p><p>Before he could say anything else, she slammed the gear and took a sharp corner at full speed.</p><p>Mr. Damien grabbed the seat, his heart pounding.</p><p>He started shouting, his voice shaking. “What are you doing? Why are you taking me here?”</p><p>LizzyPie didn’t reply. The engine roared louder as she kept speeding.</p><p>“Answer me!” he yelled, panic creeping in. “What are you doing?!”</p><p>The car suddenly swerved off the road. Gravel flew as they headed toward a dark riverbank. LizzyPie slammed the brakes.</p><p>The car stopped.</p><p>It was late at night. No streetlights. No people. Just the sound of water moving slowly and the wind brushing through the trees.</p><p>Mr. Damien shoved the door open and staggered out. “What is wrong with you? Why did you bring me here? Do you know who i am”</p><p>LizzyPie stepped out calmly and shut the door behind her. “To finish the mission.”</p><p>His blood ran cold. “Mission? What mission?”</p><p>Mr. Jay didn’t release you because of loyalty. He did it because Charles instructed him to.</p><p>According to the Godfather’s mission, they were meant to take his wealth, and then kill him. They already did the first and here to finish things off.</p><p>At that moment, Charles appeared. </p><p></p></div>
