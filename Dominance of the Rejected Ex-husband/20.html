        <h1>Chapter 20.</h1>
        <div>Charles couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Him?. As the next godfather?. That was nearly impossible for him to grasp.<br/>Even though he knew this was his grandfather, and taking the position shouldn’t feel strange, but it wouldn’t be easy. <br/>Becoming a mafia leader would mean doing cruel things. The power and the wealth could be tempting, but you could die if you weren’t smart enough.<br/>He gulped and asked, “Do you really mean it? Can I?”<br/>Mr. Vincent spread his arms. “You are the only family I have. It only makes sense I give everything to you. But becoming the mafia leader is not just about being rich and wealthy. It consists of many things, and I don’t know if you can handle it.”<br/>I know it,  Charles thought.<br/>Then Mr. Vincent added, “Before you can inherit it, you will have to pass ten trials. For each one you pass, I will give you some aspect of my property, riches, and power. You have to prove you can handle it. And I can tell you, each trial can be hard..and life-threatening.”<br/>“But… if you don’t want to be the mafia godfather, that’s okay,” he continued. “I can give you the rest of my wealth, just not the mafia part.”<br/>Mr. Vincent leaned back. “You don’t have to reply now. You can come back later. In the meantime, I will provide anything you need to survive.”<br/>Charles thought about his life. Since he was a kid, he had suffered and been looked down on. When he met Tracy, her family didn’t even want her to marry him because he was poor. And now, the only comfort he had–Tracy– had betrayed him.<br/>This was a great opportunity to turn everything around. With this, he could take back everything he had lost and finally live without shame.<br/>“I will take the trials. ”Charles replied firmly.<br/>Mr. Vincent said, “Please think it through. It will be harder than you think. Are you sure you are ready?”<br/>Charles nodded. “I am ready, Grandfather. I want to become your heir.”<br/>Mr. Vincent nodded and smiled. “I like your bravery already.” He paused for a moment before adding, “Do you have any woman in your life?”<br/>Charles sighed at the question. If this had been asked two weeks ago, he would have happily mentioned Tracy, he was crazy in love with her then. But now, he was lonely, with no woman.<br/>He shook his head. “No, I don’t.”<br/>“You will need a good woman by your side. So that will be your first trial…your first trial will be to get engaged to the third heiress of the Moretti family.”<br/>Charles thought he must have misheard. The Moretti family was one of the four most powerful families in the city. Everyone knew the third heiress, Serena. She was the number one beauty in the city, rumored to have rejected over a hundred men. How could someone like him...broke, unknown, powerless, ever get engaged to her?<br/>To make matters worse, Mr. Vincent added, “Also, you will have to do this on your own. You won’t use my name or our family connection.”<br/>What chance would Charles have, with no connections, no reputation?<br/>“I won’t even use your name?” Charles asked again.<br/>Mr. Vincent made it clear. “No. I won’t offer any help, except for the money you will be provided to survive. If you can’t do it, you will not be recognized as my heir.”<br/>Charles scoffed, already regretting saying he was ready. How could someone as poor and ordinary as him attract the heiress? Even an ordinary woman would reject him outright. And here he was, expected to win over the city’s most coveted woman. He was clearly troubled.<br/> Vincent said, “Go and show me what you’re made of. As I told you, with each trial, I will unlock each aspect of my riches.”<br/>After everything, Charles left the room feeling defeated. Some moments ago, after hearing that Mr. Vincent was his grandfather, he had imagined this would be some MyFiction novel or a flashy Reelshort TV show where he would just be spending money anyhow.<br/>This was real life, and he would have to prove himself. Mr. Vincent had already given him a card key to another room in the hotel, on the lowest floor, where he would live for now. <br/>Eating and drinking would be free for him...that was the only support he could rely on until he got Serena to marry him. making the impossible possible.<br/>That night, Charles couldn’t sleep. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. With it, he could prove Tracy wrong. That he could live without her, make her regret her decision, and intimidate Derek.<br/>He stayed up all night, searching online about Serena. He was drowned in her beauty, she was ridiculously stunning.<br/> He even found pictures of her coming out of a helicopter, surrounded by over a hundred men as her bodyguards. With that many people protecting her, how could he ever get close to her?.<br/>The next morning, Charles woke up early and had his meal. He still had his old, worn-out clothes...Mr. Vincent hadn’t even given him anything new. <br/>Fuck… he really meant it when he said I’m on my own.<br/>After dressing, he went to the PentVilla, the place he had discovered last night where Serena was rumored to be residing. renting a motorcycle so he could follow her around and get to know her lifestyle.<br/>As he arrived, he hung around, staring up at the massive villa, feeling completely out of place. He didn’t even know what to do.<br/>Hours passed. He stayed there from morning until nightfall, and he still hadn’t seen her. He knew that trying to enter would get him killed instantly. Exhausted, frustrated, and on the verge of giving up, he was about to leave when the gate of the villa slowly opened.<br/>A lady stepped out, dressed in black. The moonlight caught her silhouette, showing just how striking, and undeniably sexy she was.</div>
