        <h1>Chapter 160</h1>
        <div>They reached Winchester very late in the night, they were very quiet as they parked in front of Sapphire’s house. The front door stood slightly open.<br/>Charles felt it at once. Someone had been here. He looked around.<br/>Sapphire stepped inside first, then froze.  The room was in shambles. Drawers were pulled out, shelves overturned, wires and tools scattered across the floor. Her breath hitched and panic rushed into her voice.<br/>“Oh…My chip.”<br/>She spun and ran for the back hallway, toward her workroom. Charles followed fast, already tense, already ready.<br/>She shoved the door open.<br/>“—!”<br/>She barely had time to gasp before she stumbled back, her hand raised in shock. A cold metal barrel pressed against her temple.<br/>“Don’t move.”<br/>The man pointing the gun at her wasJasmine.<br/>Mr. Damien’s hound.<br/>Charles lifted his gaze slowly, measuring the room and every angle. <br/>Jasmine smiled thinly. “I know you come back here. I  told you Mr. Damien never forgives. You can run as far as you want. He will always find you.”<br/>Sapphire swallowed hard. “Jasmine… please.”<br/>“Quiet,” Jasmine snapped, tightening his grip. Then he looked back at Charles. “One step and I blow her head off.”<br/>Charles exhaled slowly. “Be careful with that gun and lower it.”<br/>Jasmine laughed. “You really think I’m scared of you because you beat a few men last time. This is different.”<br/>The door behind Charles burst open. Footsteps filled the room as several men poured in, spreading out and boxing him in. Jasmine motioned once and they rushed him together.<br/> Charles let them grab him, let them force his arms down.<br/>Jasmine watched closely, then smirked. “Good choice. Mr. Damien would like a word with you.”<br/>Charles said nothing. His eyes were cold and focused. Maybe this meeting was exactly what he needed. With this meeting, he envisioned that he could use the opportunity to see who Mr. Damien was physically, and maybe even killed him.<br/>Jasmine snapped her fingers again. One of the men stepped forward with a syringe, the liquid inside glinting under the light.<br/>Sapphire screamed. “Charles!”<br/>He turned his head just enough to see her face. “It’s fine,” he said quietly.<br/>The needle plunged into his neck.<br/>The world tilted. Everything becomes blurry.<br/>“Charles!” Sapphire cried as his knees buckled.<br/>His vision went dark and his body hit the floor<br/>Thud!<br/>The last thing he heard was Sapphire calling his name as they dragged her away.<br/>×××××<br/>A dull ringing filled Charles’s head.<br/>Dong. He groaned and tried to open his eyes. They felt heavy, like someone had poured lead into them. He forced them anyway.<br/>Everything was blurry before. Until it started becoming clearer.<br/>He sucked in a breath and found out he was bound. Not with rope, but with something like a handcuff, in his wrist only.<br/>His hands were locked together behind him, clamped.<br/>He twisted his wrists and pulled hard. Nothing moved. It was solid. Too solid.<br/>“what the heck is this”<br/>He strained again, muscles tightening, veins standing out. The cuffs did not even tremble.<br/>“Charles… Charles, are you okay?”<br/>His head lifted slowly.<br/>Sapphire was sitting a few meters ahead of him. Her hands were tied behind her back. Her hair was messy and her eyes were red<br/>“I’m fine,” Charles said hoarsely. “You?”<br/>She nodded quickly. “I’m okay. I think so. Thank God… Thank God.”<br/>Charles tested the cuffs again, this time pushing power into his arms. Pain shot through his wrists, sharp and electric. He hissed and stopped.<br/>“Fuck, what's that!”.<br/>Just then, slow footsteps echoed through the room.<br/>An old man stepped into view.<br/>He was dressed simply but expensively, a long dark coat resting neatly on his shoulders. His hair was white, slicked back, and his eyes were calm in a way that felt unnatural. Behind that calm was something cold and absolute.<br/>He stopped in front of Charles.<br/>“Don’t bother,” the man said mildly. “Those are electronic magnetic handcuffs. They were programmed and can only be uncuffed by a remote.  I can even electrify you to death with it”.<br/>The old man smiled. “Even the strongest object in the world can’t short them. They were designed for monsters.”<br/>Behind the man was Jasmine. <br/>Charles stared at him for a long second, then said quietly, “So this really is you. Damien.”<br/>The man’s smile widened.<br/>“Yes,” he said. “It’s me.”<br/>He spread his arms slightly, as if presenting himself.<br/>“Mr. Damien. The man people fear to offend. The man nobody should dare look down on. But I heard you did.”<br/>He leaned closer to Charles, his voice lowering.<br/>“You told my people I should watch out for you. You called me nobody, who the hell do you think you are?”<br/>The room went silent.<br/>Charles scoffed.<br/>“Yeah,” he said, lifting his chin. “I said all of that. Maybe I should repeat it to your face.  Just because you are rich and powerful doesn’t mean people are your toys. You don’t get to control anyone just because you want to. You are nobody in people’s personal lives. Fuck you.”<br/>The room went still.<br/>Then Mr. Damien laughed softly.<br/>“Wow,” he said, glancing sideways at Jasmine. “You weren’t exaggerating.”<br/>He reached out and Jasmine collected a small black remote into his hand.<br/>Click.<br/>A violent current surged through Charles’s body.<br/>“YAAAAAA—!”<br/>His back arched hard against the chair as electricity ripped through his nerves. Every muscle locked. His teeth clenched so tight his jaw screamed. Pain exploded everywhere in his body at once. <br/>“Yaaaaa”. <br/>Then it stopped.<br/>Charles slumped forward, gasping as sweat poured down his face.<br/>Mr. Damien crouched slightly so they were eye level. “I don’t think you have the power to run your mouth here. If you anger me again, I will kill you.”<br/>Charles lifted his head slowly, breathing hard, eyes burning. “Your days are numbered, motherfucker. I will kill you myself.”<br/>Damien’s smile faded.<br/>He straightened. “Let me educate you. If I press this for one minute, you will be crippled. Three minutes and your organs shut down. You will beg for death. Five minutes…” He tilted his head. “You explode from the inside.”<br/>He leaned closer. “Talk shit about me one more time and I will end your life here. Slowly.”<br/>Charles stared at him. Then he smirked.<br/>“So let me repeat it,” he said hoarsely. “Because you are rich doesn’t mean you can control anyone. Fuck you.”<br/>For the first time, Mr. Damien looked genuinely shocked. Even with his threat, Charles didn't budge. <br/>Then his face twisted with anger.<br/>“Fine,” he said coldly. “If that’s what you want.”<br/>Click. He pressed it again.<br/>SHRRRRRK—<br/>The electricity hit harder this time.<br/>“YAAAAAAAAAAAA—!”<br/>Charles screamed as his body convulsed violently, veins bulging, vision flashing white and black as pain tore through him.</div>
