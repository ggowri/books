        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div><p>Charles squinted slightly, wondering what Lizzypie meant.</p><p>Lizzypie continued as she removed the container’s lid. Inside was a circular green tablet,  the Fig of Vigour.</p><p>“I was told this can’t work by itself,” she said. “Especially if we want to use it for heart disease. We have to mix it with a rare stone — the Nytheris Black Stone. We will grind the stone into powder and mix it with the pill. That’s the only way it will work.”</p><p>Charles nodded slowly. He hadn’t expected this to be easy, just as Lizzypie had claimed. </p><p>Sickle cell complications that affect the heart had never been officially curable. For a single pill to heal something that severe, it would have to be almost magical. Hence, the Nytheris Black Stone. That was the true source of the miracle.</p><p>“Oh… but I heard the Nytheris Stone doesn’t exist anymore, that it vanished years ago. How are we supposed to get it?” Charles asked.</p><p>The Nytheris Stone was one of the lost relics from the First World War; no one had ever set eyes on it again.</p><p>“Well,” Lizzypie said with a small grin, “here’s the good news. Some archaeologists recently found a group of buried stones deep under a mountain and Nytheris was among them. Tomorrow, the stones will be auctioned.”</p><p>Charles’ eyes brightened. “Really? Nytheris is among them?”</p><p>“Yes,” she confirmed. “I checked, it’s on the list for tomorrow’s auction.”</p><p>“Okay, then let’s go get it,” Charles said eagerly.</p><p>“Mmm… how?”</p><p>“By stealing it, of course,” he said, half-grinning. “I told you, my eyes are improving. My speed and reflexes are getting crazy, stealing it won’t be a problem.”</p><p>Lizzypie sighed, shaking her head. “You always want things fast and easy, Charles. That’s not how this works. The auction is being held at the National Hall, government property. Do you know how much security will be there? These archaeologists aren’t ordinary people either; they study ancient relics,  some probably have their own powers. You could be killed before you even get close.”</p><p>Charles fell silent.</p><p>“For you to get that stone,” Lizzypie said softly, “you will have to bid  like everyone else. The auction starts tomorrow.”</p><p>Charles slumped back on the sofa, rubbing his temples. “That stone is priceless. Since it’s one of a kind, the price will shoot up. My sixty million dollars won’t even stand a chance.”</p><p>Lizzypie shrugged lightly. “Well, that’s for you to figure out.”</p><p>He sighed heavily and leaned deeper into the cushions. “Damn… I’m so tired. So tired.”</p><p>Lizzypie’s shadow fell across him. Her tone softened.</p><p>“Well,” she murmured, “maybe I can help you ease the stress.”</p><p>Charles looked up at her, confused but intrigued. “Ease my stress? How?”</p><p>Lizzpie just smiled, and before he knew it, she went on her knees, bent to where his trousers were, and started undoing them.</p><p>“What… what… what are you trying to do?” Charles stammered as he gulped.</p><p>Lizzpie blinked. “Mmm, what do you think? Trying to ease your stress, or should I stop and not mind?”</p><p>“No, no, please continue… continue,” he grinned.</p><p>Lizzypie dropped down his trousers and also his underwear, before she got hold of his now very hardened cock.</p><p>Without hesitating, she shoved it straight to her mouth.</p><p>“Mmmm”, Derek hummed, feeling very much better, as he held her hair, urging her to go forward.</p><p>Lizzypie knelt on the floor, her hands firmly pushing Derek’s thighs apart, spreading his legs wide to give herself room. </p><p>She was steady with It, as she moved up and down, In fact, spatting on his cock. </p><p>She flicked her eyes up, catching his gaze, and with a sly grin, she took one of his balls into her mouth, rolling it gently with her tongue. </p><p>“Wow”, Derek let out a deep moan, the sound sending a thrill through her. </p><p>She swished it around, savoring the warmth, then switched to the other, her hands gliding along his thighs, stroking in slow, firm circles. </p><p>She drew both balls into her mouth, her tongue tenderly licking, lips enveloping them fully up to the base of his cock. </p><p>His breathing turned heavy, ragged, and she felt his body tense under her hands.“Oh, Lizzypie!” Derek groaned.</p><p>Her hands moved to his cock, stroking slowly, then faster and faster. </p><p>Charles moans grew sharper, his body tensing, and she felt the telltale tremor in his thighs. </p><p>Lizzypie didn’t let up, her lips and tongue relentless, pushing him closer until his grip tightened in her hair.</p><p>  “Lizzypie!” He called out her name. His body shuddered, a sharp gasp breaking free as he finally came, and she slowed her movements, before making sure, she swallowed every drop of his liquid.</p><p>Lizzypie pulled back, wiping her mouth with a quick swipe of her hand, a satisfied smirk curling her lips as she met his dazed eyes. Charle’s head lolled back.</p><p>“Are you better now”, she asked.</p><p>“Fuck… yeah”, he managed to answer amidst his heavy breathing. Then, lizzypie just stood up, and made her way to her room, leaving Charles alone. </p><p>×××××</p><p>The next morning came quickly, and Charles and Lizzpie dressed up to go for the auction. On their way in the car, Charles began, “About… yesterday…”</p><p>Lizzpie immediately interrupted him. “That… that was nothing. I just did that to ease your stress, and as a form of apology for what I said. It’s nothing. Mmm, can we not talk about it?”</p><p>Charles just scoffed as he nodded and  pressed the pedal.</p><p>Their exotic red Ferrari C-10 stopped in front of the National Hall, and everyone couldn’t help but admire it. Charles was the first to get out of the car, then he opened the door for Lizzpie, and she gently stepped down, Charles holding her hand.</p><p>As soon as people saw that it was Charles, whispers started flying around.</p><p>“That’s the man who struck the yellow sapphire yesterday.”</p><p>“He is worth 100 million dollars now!, I heard he was just an ordinary firefighter before”.</p><p>“Who the heck is that hot lady beside him? I heard he’s engaged to Ms. Serena, but already with another woman!”</p><p>They ignored the murmurs and were about to enter when a voice called from ahead</p><p>“Just a little win yesterday and you are already here?”</p><p>Charles sighed, already knowing who it was, and gazed up to see Tracy and Derek.</p></div>
