        <h1>Chapter 21.</h1>
        <div>Charles watched from afar as Serena, the beauty, spoke to a bodyguard. After a few minutes, she entered a car and drove away.<br/>Charles frowned. Why would she be going out without a bodyguard? He immediately picked up his motorcycle and started following her. He kept his distance, staying far enough behind so she wouldn’t notice.<br/>After several minutes of riding, they reached a quiet stretch of road. From afar, Charles saw cars appear from nowhere, blocking Serena’s path and forcing her to a sudden stop.<br/>It was so sudden and dangerous that Serena nearly lost control. She swerved sharply to avoid crashing. Then, another car slid in from behind, trapping her completely. Charles’s gut twisted, he could see everything happening.<br/>“What the hell is going on there?” he muttered, braking hard and jumping off his motorcycle.<br/>The car doors flung open. Men poured out, some gripping heavy batons, others brandishing guns that gleamed under the dim light.<br/>Charles’s eyes narrowed. His stomach dropped. She’s been ambushed.<br/>“Oh, fuck!” he hissed, and rushed forward.<br/>Before he could even reach them, the fight had already begun. Serena wasn’t helpless, she was fired in motion. <br/>One thug swung a baton, but she ducked under it, her heel slamming into his knee. He collapsed, screaming. <br/>Another lunged with a crowbar...she twisted, slammed her elbow into his ribs, and finished him with a savage kick to the jaw.<br/>Charles stopped for a split second, stunned. She can fight!.<br/>Serena  fought with lethal elegance. She flipped one thug over her shoulder, his body crashing against the car door with a metallic thud. She grabbed another by the wrist, twisted until the bone cracked, then hurled him to the ground. Three were already down, groaning in agony.<br/>Bang! Bang!<br/>Gunshots shattered the air. Serena froze, her eyes widening as the leader stepped forward, pistol leveled at her head.<br/>“Quite the show,” he sneered, lips curling. “But this is where it ends. You will die now.”<br/>Serena ’s jaw tightened. She gulped, but there was no fear in her eyes. The man smirked, raising the gun.<br/>“Goodbye.”<br/>And that was when Charles chimed in.<br/>He came in like a storm, his boot slamming into the leader’s wrist. The gun spun across the ground, clattering into the dirt. Time slowed, the leader staggered back in shock, the other thugs momentarily stunned, and Celinina’s eyes snapped to Charles, trying to figure out who the hell he was.<br/>The leader snarled, pointing at him. “Who the hell are you? How dare you interfere in a matter that doesn’t concern you!”<br/>“Harming such a pretty woman does concern me,” Charles shot back, his voice hard.<br/>“You’re begging for death. Kill them both!” the leader barked.<br/>The thugs raised their weapons.<br/>But in the blink of an eye Charles moved. <br/>Satan Eyes activated.<br/>His eyes glinted darkly, something almost unnatural flashing in them. He blurred forward, striking with brutal precision.<br/> He sprinted amidst them, ripped the magazine out, and cracked its owner across the face with the butt. <br/>He spun, drove his fist into another thug’s throat, and dislocated another shoulder with a vicious twist.<br/>Simultaneously, he swept toward the leader, a devastating kick smashing into his knee. Bone cracked, and the leader dropped to the ground with a scream.<br/>“Yaaaaa”.<br/>When it was over, Charles stood, even surprised of himself.<br/>He was smirking, breathing steady as he dropped a handful of magazines to the ground, their ammo stripped clean. <br/>The gang stared in shock. He had disabled them all in a blink. And all his gang was writhing in pain.<br/>“He is a moaster!”. They cried.<br/>“Please… don’t kill me,” the leader begged, eyes wet with terror.<br/>Serena  stepped forward, marveling at the man in front of her. but keeping her composure.<br/> She pressed a gun to the leader’s forehead. “If you want to live, tell me who sent you.”<br/>The leader trembled, his voice breaking. “It… it’s the Bone Fraternity!”<br/>Serena  frowned. That wasn’t the name she wanted. The Bone Fraternity was nothing but a local gang. She had expected him to say the Eason family...the sworn enemies of the Moretti family.<br/>She hissed in frustration.<br/>Just then, more cars roared onto the scene. Celinina’s bodyguards spilled out, weapons ready.<br/>“Ma’am, are you okay?” their captain asked.<br/>“I’m fine. Kill them all,” Serena ordered coldly.<br/>The thugs screamed in protest. “Please! You promised to spare us!” The leader dropped to his knees, crying.<br/>But Serena didn’t care. She gave a simple gesture, and her men opened fire. Bullets tore through flesh. Blood sprayed across the road. The ambushers fell like broken dolls, their screams dying into silence.<br/>Charles stood frozen, horrified. Blood spattered across his face, sticky and hot. Thank God he had hidden behind Serena, otherwise, he might have been caught in the hail of bullets.<br/>He swallowed hard, bile rising in his throat. <br/>“Is this the woman Mr. Vincent wants me to engage with? … I’m already dead”.</div>
