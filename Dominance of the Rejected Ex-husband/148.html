        <h1>Chapter 148</h1>
        <div>The leader smirked, pocketing his phone with satisfaction. “See? That wasn’t so hard. You asked nicely”<br/>Charles stood there, and repeated “The inhaler. Give it to me now.”<br/>The boy chuckled, shaking his head. “Oh, right. That thing? It’s in the dustbin outside. We tossed it there after snatching it. Go fish it out yourself.”<br/>Charles’s eyes widened in disbelief, but there was no time to argue. He bolted out of the unfinished building.<br/>There—near the entrance, a rusted metal dustbin overflowing with trash. He plunged his hand in without hesitation, rummaging through until he found it. <br/>He yanked it out, wiped it hastily on his shirt, and sprinted back toward the alley where the girls were.<br/>One minute past the deadline he’d calculated. Panic surged through him. The ambulance hadn’t arrived yet. What if he was too late?<br/>He skidded into the alley, knees hitting the ground beside the girl. She was still jerking faintly.<br/>“Here—hold on!” Charles shouted, shaking the inhaler vigorously. He pressed it to her mouth, and pushed it.<br/>One puff.<br/>She didn’t respond immediately.<br/>He pushed again—two drags, just as needed.<br/>Suddenly, her eyes snapped open wide. Her chest heaved as air rushed in. She coughed violently, then gasped <br/>Charles helped her sit up straight, supporting her back. “Are… are you okay?”<br/>She nodded weakly, still catching her breath, tears streaming down her cheeks as the oxygen returned.<br/>Charles turned frantically to her friend, who was hovering nearby, pale and trembling. “I told you to call the ambulance! Where is it?”<br/>The friend wrung her hands, voice shaking. “I did!! But this is a rural area… they always take time. Sometimes forever.”<br/>Charles decided to wait for the ambulance for proper treatment, but minutes dragged on for like five to ten, maybe more than that. It felt like an eternity. There was nothing. <br/>Finally, the girl who’d nearly died steadied her breathing. She looked up at Charles with wide, grateful eyes. “Let’s go home. I’m fine now. The ambulance isn’t coming.”<br/>Charles frowned with anger. “No, we wait. I will call again—”<br/>She reached out weakly, grabbing his arm. “Please, uncle. I’m perfectly fine now. The inhaler is all I needed. Really.”<br/>Her friend nodded vigorously, tears in her eyes too.<br/>Both girls turned to him then, their voices overlapping in a rush of apologies and thanks.<br/>“I’m so sorry for everything,” the recovered girl said, bowing her head. “We didn’t mean to drag you into this. You saved my life. If not for you… I would have died.”<br/>“Yes, thank you so much,” her friend added, nearly sobbing. “We are so grateful. You’re a hero. We will  never forget this. Sorry for the trouble, sorry for everything…”<br/>Charles softened, waving it off. “It’s nothing. It's my duty, I can't just ignore that.”<br/>He glanced around warily, the boys’ faces still fresh in his mind. “Where’s your home? Get in the car—I will drive you. It’s not safe here.”<br/>They hesitated, exchanging glances. “It’s okay, uncle,” the girl said shyly. “We can walk. It’s not far.”<br/>“No,” Charles insisted firmly. “Who knows what those boys will do if they see you again? Come on. Get in.”<br/>After that, they nodded gratefully and climbed into his car, murmuring more quiet thanks as he started the engine and pulled away from the alley.<br/>Charles kept his eyes on the road, as he asked “who is that boy? The one who took the inhaler?”<br/>The recovering girl stiffened. “He’s a demon, uncle. He bullies us every day.”<br/>Charles frowned. “Then why didn’t you report him to the police?”<br/>The girl let out a small, bitter scoff. “Police? They won’t do anything. Nobody dares his father in this city.”<br/>Charles turned sharply at that, “who is his father”. But the slump of her shoulders told him she was done talking. He let it go.<br/> The car rolled deeper into the outskirts of the city.<br/>After a few minutes, they arrived at a rural area. The buildings changed. The paved roads gave way to cracked, faded concrete. Houses leaned tiredly against each other, their walls patched with mismatched cement. <br/>Corrugated roofs sagged at the edges. Rusted gates hung crooked. <br/>“We are home,” the friend said quietly.<br/>Charles pulled over beside a narrow compound with peeling paint and a door that looked older and shabby. They climbed out, murmuring thanks again and again.<br/>The girl who’d nearly died turned to him. “Uncle, can you wait and eat with us? Just to show gratitude. It’s the least we can do.”<br/>Charles almost laughed. “No, no. It’s fine. Don’t bother yourselves.”<br/>The other girl narrowed her eyes playfully. “Hmm. Because our house is old, right?”<br/>Charles blinked, then scoffed. “Oh no, nothing like that. Alright, alright—let’s go in.”<br/>They led him through the small yard. One of the girls knocked gently.<br/>The door creaked open.<br/>And there stood a woman. Setting eyes on him, Charles went into daze and lost.<br/> The woman, probably in her mid-40s stood there, tall, fair-skinned, wearing thin gold-rimmed glasses.<br/> A tight black sleeveless swimsuit covered her upper body. Her breasts were very big, heavy, and round, pushing hard against the thin fabric. The nipples were clearly visible, stiff and poking straight out, two small points pressing through the cloth with every breath she took.<br/>Her waist was tiny, almost too small for her body. Below it, loose grey trousers sat low on wide hips and thick thighs.<br/>Long black hair was tied loosely behind her head, a few strands sticking to her neck because of the heat. Her lips were full and red like roses. <br/>She blinked at Charles for a second, then smiled warmly.<br/>“Please… who are you mister”.<br/>Charles jolted back alive. “Uhm… uhmm…”.<br/>Then the girl told her everything that happened. <br/>“Fuck, when is that evil boy and his goons going to stop, they will kill you at this rate”, She sighed. <br/>Then avert her gaze to Charles,  “You saved my niece’s life,” she said in a low, smooth voice. “Please come inside. Let me thank you properly.”<br/>Charles gulped, “Yeah… sure”.</div>
