        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div><p>Charles sat up straight, excitement flickering in his eyes as he heard Lizzypie say,</p><p>“Really? You have a way, and you’ve been watching me all this while? Please, tell me!”</p><p>“Don’t get ahead of yourself,” she replied. “It’s not that simple. The thing is, Mr. Vasilios has an heir, his only son, twenty-seven years old. </p><p>He’s Mr. Vasilios’ favorite person in the entire world, the one he hoped to continue his legacy.”</p><p>Charles frowned, wondering where this was going.</p><p>“The problem,” Lizzypie continued, “is that the son is a sickler. He’s suffered from severe illnesses since childhood, and recently he was diagnosed with a heart disease. The doctors say he has only two months to live.”</p><p>Charles frowned again, a flicker of sympathy passing through him. He felt genuinely sorry for both the heir and Mr. Vasilios; such a loss would break any father. Leaning forward, he asked,</p><p>“So, how does this information help?”</p><p>“Well,” she said, lowering her voice slightly, “there’s this herb called The figs of Vigour. It’s rare, mythical, and magical not officially recognized by medical experts. But it’s said to cure the illness completely. The heart, the blood, everything. The heir would be healthy and normal again. Mr. Vasilios would trade anything in the world for it.”</p><p>Charles squinted, his curiosity deepening. He wouldn’t have believed it if not for the strange, magical things he had already witnessed lately. Anything seemed possible now.</p><p>“Okay then, where is it? Let’s go get it right now,” he said excitedly.</p><p>“Hey,” Lizzypie warned, “like I told you, it’s rare. And the only person who has it is Mr. Vincent, the godfather.”</p><p>That made Charles tense up. It was rare, yet somehow just within his reach. He quickly said they should call Mr. Vincent right away.</p><p>“Are you an idiot?” she snapped. “He made it clear he won’t help you. He’s not giving it to you for free. You can buy it though—forty million dollars!”</p><p>Charles’s jaw dropped. That was a hell of a lot of money.</p><p>“How can I get that kind of money? Will you lend it to me? I swear I will pay you back.”</p><p>Lizzypie stared at him in disdain. “Why would I lend you that much? You already live off me for free, and now you want me to lend you money? Well, first, I don’t even have that kind of cash. And second, this trial mission isn’t supposed to be easy. Mr. Vincent sent me to help you with work, not hand you money.”</p><p>Charles slumped, completely deflated then suddenly brightened.</p><p>“Let’s go to the casino and gamble. I have my X-ray eyes.”</p><p>Lizzypie shook her head in disappointment. “You really think you can walk out alive after winning forty million? That’s no small money. Most casinos don’t even operate with that much capital. If you win that kind of money, it exceeds their liquidity—they won’t pay you. They will kill you instead.</p><p>“And besides, you can’t play small games with your level of X-ray ability. Like I told you before, if you use it too much, your eyes will pop out.”</p><p>That struck him hard. Paying such a huge sum to a single player would bankrupt any casino. Now, Charles had exhausted every idea in his head.</p><p>Then Lizzypie said, “Dress up. I know somewhere you can make forty million dollars in a few minutes. And if you do well, you’ll even upgrade your eyes to level three.”</p><p>Charles was stunned. Lizzypie always had a solution.</p><p>××××</p><p>Charles and Lizzypie arrived at the biggest jewelry exchange store in the city—The Light Store.</p><p>Charles recognized the place instantly. Tracy used to come here most of the time.</p><p>It wasn’t just any jewelry shop; it was famous across the city for its dazzling display of pre-cut stones—from sapphires to rubies and diamonds.</p><p>But that wasn’t the big deal here. The real deal was Blind Stone trading.</p><p>It wasn’t ordinary trade; it was more of a gamble. A table would be laid with uncut, raw stones, and buyers would pick based on instinct, knowledge, or sheer luck.</p><p>Some of those stones contained veins of gold, raw gems, or even pure diamonds, while some contained nothing.</p><p>One good slice could turn a man into a millionaire overnight.</p><p>One bad cut, and a legacy could vanish in seconds.</p><p>That’s why the trade demanded more than luck. It required sharp eyes, trained instincts, and experience.</p><p>For Charles, that wasn’t a problem. With his X-ray eyes, he could see straight through the stones and know their content. To him, earning forty million here sounded almost too easy. Just spot the right stone and cut. Simple.</p><p>But what puzzled him was what Lizzypie had said earlier about this place helping him reach Level Three.</p><p>“How does this connect to upgrading my eyes?” he finally asked.</p><p>Lizzypie smirked. “After Level Two, it becomes almost impossible to advance. It could take decades, sometimes a lifetime. The only way for faster upgrade is if the eyes get nurtured by real energy, and some stones, especially high-level sapphire stones. It contains special mineral resources that could help. In simple terms, some stones contain spiritual power.”</p><p>Charles was so excited hearing this, he wondered what the next level of the Eye of Satan would be. Even with just the X-ray vision, it was already gold.</p><p>“Let’s go then… but I don’t have money. The stones require hefty sums to buy. The starting price is one million dollars,” he said.</p><p>The stones were so expensive—that’s why people lost their wealth in the trade. You make a wrong cut, you lose a million dollars, and it’s very addictive; you keep playing.</p><p>“Well, that’s up to you. You should find money to buy a stone,” Lizzypie said.</p><p>“But how? Okay, borrow me. Since I have these X-ray eyes, I will definitely get something valuable. I will pay you back with interest,” he said.</p><p>“Should I remind you, I said I can’t give you any money from my hand? You should learn how to get things done yourself,” Lizzypie said coldly.</p><p>Charles didn’t understand her. “Why are you acting like a witch, Lizzypie? Stop proving hard. We even slept together already.”</p><p>“One hook-up doesn’t mean cash-out. Anyway, I am leaving. I have done my part. I have somewhere to be.”</p><p>Lizzypie started walking away.</p><p>“Hey, don’t leave me,” Charles called after her, but she was already gone, leaving him behind. </p><p>No money. How would he play this then?</p></div>
