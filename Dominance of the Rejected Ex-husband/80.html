        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div><p>Again, Norman was forced to bow down to Charles; he couldn’t believe he was facing constant humiliation because of him. Although he didn’t have to follow what Janet said, he had to see Mr. Vasilios, and that left him no choice but to bow for Charles.</p><p>“I am sorry,” he muttered. His vein in his neck felt like it could pop out.</p><p>Janet smiled. “Well, I think we are good and okay now,” she said, and ordered the door to be opened for the two of them. They made their way in.</p><p>“How is Ms. Serena? How is she doing?” Janet asked, having a conversation with Charles. </p><p>Charles even asked about his fiancée, who was currently out of the country at the moment. This made Norman very angry.</p><p>“How is he even able to smitten them?” Norman muttered to himself. </p><p>Soon after they arrived at the very vast and wide living room of Mr. Vasilios. There were many guards with guns everywhere, and Mr. Vasilios sat in the middle of the king’s sofa, checking some documents.</p><p>As soon as he saw his daughter, he was very delighted. “Ohh, wow — my beautiful queen is here!” He rushed up, stood to greet her and hugged her.</p><p>At that moment his face landed on Charles. He slowly released his daughter and demanded, “We don’t have any appointment today. Why are you here, please?” He recognized Charles, but Mr. Vasilios was a very strict person: any visitor had to make an appointment, and the security guard should have called him before allowing entry.</p><p>Charles bowed. “Good day. I am ——”</p><p>Norman immediately interrupted him. “He is here to spew some bullshit! I even told the guard not to let him in, but I think he has some good history with Ms. Janet and she allowed him.”</p><p>Charles faced Norman. “I am not here to tell you bullshit. I am here—”</p><p>Norman cut through him again. “Sir, you shouldn’t even give him any opportunity to talk. Let me tell you myself what he is here for. He wants to negotiate with you that you should stop taking dues from the Moretti family! And he is planning on doing that by exchanging it with the Nyoheris stone he luckily got!”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios frowned. “Uh? Is that true?”</p><p>Charles sighed and decided to tell the truth. “Yeah. I am here to cut a deal.”</p><p>“What! So you think that stone will buy it? Though the Nytheris stone is very valuable and priceless, this is about my power and reputation. Look — if Mr. Moretti leaves under me, many contractors will join them and they will also stop paying me! Mr. Moretti is top of the game in mining, and for all other miners’ companies to join me, he must join me. That alone costs me over 1 billion per month. I can’t throw that away. Well, I can buy the stone at a very reasonable price from you so you will never be poor again, but I can never do that your deal!” he howled at him.</p><p>Charles maintained his composure and said, “Well, I will make you accept the deal.”</p><p>Norman was so pissed off. “What the hell are you doing?” he said. “He said he isn’t interested. Why are you being disrespectful, Mr. Vasilios? You can’t just be looking at him with disrespect!”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios also stepped forward. “The reason I haven’t tossed you out of here is because I think you have ambition and also because my daughter likes you, so I will respect you for that. If you insist on that rubbish deal of yours, you will give me no choice but to beat you out of here!”</p><p>Charles didn’t fear a bit. He stepped forward and said, “Maybe you should hear me out then. I have something to tell you — I can cure your son!”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone in the room froze, including Norman. He squeezed his face, wondering what this mad man was saying.</p><p>Janet stepped forward. “Look, I respect you, but I think you should respect my brother… don’t you dare mock him! Now get out of here.”</p><p>Norman saw this as an opportunity. “Ms. Janet, can you see it now? I always told you he is bitter, crazy. You shouldn’t even allow him in the first place. Now he is mocking your sick brother!”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios stepped forward right then and said, “Look, I know my son can’t survive this again, and I just want to spend the rest of his days with him and cherish his final moments. Don’t you dare think you can use his ailment to scam me or do anything? As my daughter said — leave!”</p><p>Norman grinned and thought Charles was so crazy for making that statement; that was so foolish of him.</p><p>“If you can just let me talk,” Charles demanded.</p><p>“You have no words in your mouth other than the nonsense you are spouting,” Norman sneered.</p><p>Mr. Vasilios added, “The best doctor in this world can’t even cure him, but you — I don’t think you are a doctor in the world who can do it. That is clearly a mockery, and I don’t take it.” He switched tones. “For that, you will be punished!”</p><p>“Guards, pin him up and teach him some lessons right now!” Norman grinned and believed again that finally Charles would be beaten and humiliated.</p><p>But the moment was cut off as one of the maids rushed in. She caught her breath. “It’s young master — he is acting funny. I think he’s in shock. You have to come and check him right now. He is even spitting blood!”</p><p>Hearing this, Mr. Vasilios dashed and sprinted with the maid; Janet followed. In fact, some bodyguards followed as well. Seeing this, Norman followed and Charles also followed.</p><p>They arrived at a room, and it was perfectly designed as a ward — in fact, one more efficient than a hospital. Mr. Vasilios had his son’s hospital at home just for situations like this.</p><p>Truly, Kyle was acting funny. The monitor was rushing and falling.</p><p>Beep, beep, beep followed each other. Kyle started to puff his chest up and down — a sign of shock. He was in shock and could die at any moment.</p><p></p></div>
