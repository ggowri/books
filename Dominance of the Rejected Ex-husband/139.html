        <h1>Chapter 139.</h1>
        <div>The moment Wilson hit the floor, the officers immediately rushed in. They pinned him down before he could even lift his head.<br/>One of them cuffed Wilson’s wrists. “You’re under arrest for murder and attempted murder!”<br/>The courtroom buzzed with disbelief as Wilson kept thrashing. He turned to face Norman and shrieked, “Norman! I swear, the moment I get out, I will kill you! You hear me? I will fucking kill you!”<br/>Norman gulped, shaking.<br/>The officers dragged Wilson out of the courtroom while he continued yelling threats. Then two more officers moved straight toward the prosecutor.<br/>“You’re coming with us,” one of them said.<br/>“What? No! They’re lying! This is a setup!” the prosecutor shouted. They cuffed him without further explanation and dragged him out alongside Wilson.<br/>People slowly began to rise from behind tables and benches. The panic faded, replaced by shock.<br/>Someone whispered loudly, “Wow… he took him down like it was nothing.”<br/>Another added, “He saved all of us. And he was the one accused this whole time.”<br/>They started praising Charles—because he had literally disarmed Wilson by himself without endangering anyone.<br/>“He was publicly shamed. Everyone called him a killer… and he still stepped forward to protect us.”<br/>“What a man.”<br/>The judge rose from behind the bench, still shaken. He cleared his throat and looked straight at Charles.<br/>“Mr. Charles… I—and everyone here—owe you an apology. You were treated unfairly by this court. Evidence was mishandled. Your name was dragged through the mud. Yet you protected everyone here without hesitation.”<br/>The room fell silent as the judge continued, “I hereby declare you not guilty on all charges. You are free to go. Furthermore, in light of the grave injustice you suffered, this court orders five million dollars in compensation for the damage done to your life and reputation.”<br/>Gasps erupted across the courtroom.<br/>“Five million?”<br/>“That’s huge.”<br/>“Wow… that’s a lot.”<br/>Charles shook his head calmly. “Your Honor, I don’t want the money. I only did what any citizen should do. My only request is that this court ensures the innocent never suffer for crimes they didn’t commit.”<br/>The crowd murmured again.<br/>“Wow…”<br/>“He refused five million?”<br/>“He’s unbelievable.”<br/>People now praised him openly. “He deserves ultimate respect.”<br/>Across the courtroom, Serena tugged at her lips in a soft smile.<br/>“I knew he’d turn it around,” she whispered to herself. “He always does.”<br/>Minutes later the courtroom emptied, but Charles’s name remained on every tongue. People walked out still talking about him like he was some kind of hero.<br/>Charles, Lizzypie, Natasha, and Serena stepped outside together. Natasha lifted her face to the sky, took a long, relieved breath, and grinned.<br/>“Yeah… we did it.”<br/>Serena nudged Charles lightly. “And you were really cool back there. Those lines you dropped? The media will be shouting your name by tomorrow.”<br/>Lizzypie looked up at him with a proud little smile. “You handled everything perfectly.”<br/>Just then, Norman wheeled himself toward them. He gulped hard and stopped right in front of Charles like a nervous child.<br/>“Uhmm…” he said quietly. “I helped you. So… can you please delete the video now? Please… don’t upload it.”<br/>Natasha and Lizzypie exchanged a look and burst into matching sly smiles. Then they explained to Charles and Serena what had really happened.<br/>That day, when Lizzypie and Natasha had gone to meet Norman. They pretended to go along with his original perverted threesome request, acting completely willing and seductive so he would let his guard down.<br/>They kissed him, touched him, undressed him, and even stroked his penis to make him believe he was finally getting what he wanted.<br/>Once he was fully aroused and defenseless, Natasha grabbed his testicles with extreme force, crushing and twisting them deliberately and repeatedly until she caused permanent, catastrophic damage. That was the real reason Norman ended up permanently in a wheelchair.<br/>At the same time, they filmed and photographed him naked and crying. They then used the material to blackmail him and force him to testify in court, telling the full truth about what he had really seen the night of the murder.<br/>Serena frowned at the thought of the pain Norman had endured. “Wow, that was totally brutal… but you deserved a lot more than that.”<br/>Charles scoffed and folded his arms. “You’re so foolish and disgusting you never think. Now you might never be able to have children.”<br/>They all burst into laughter. Norman just sat there, seething with anger, but there was nothing he could do.<br/>“Please… just delete it. I beg you,” he pleaded sincerely.<br/>“Well, we’ll keep our promise,” Lizzypie said. She pulled out her phone and showed him the video—it was utterly embarrassing. Then she deleted it in front of him.<br/>He gulped in relief. “There are no copies, right?”<br/>Lizzypie assured him there were none. So he wheeled himself away while they all laughed at him.<br/>Norman wished the ground would swallow him whole from the humiliation. This was his downfall; even his father wasn’t interested in what had happened to him and had vowed never to help him get revenge. But his heart boiled with rage, and he would never forget what had happened today.<br/>After Norman left, Charles and the others decided to head out too—when they saw Tracy coming toward them.<br/>She approached with a smile and said, “I knew you were innocent! Good thing you proved it. I’m really happy for you.”<br/>Lizzypie and the others felt their stomachs churn; they could have devoured her alive.<br/>Serena scoffed and stepped forward. “You’re happy for him? You knew he was innocent, but you never once came to check on him while he was in custody!”.<br/>Tracy sneered at her. “Hey, bitch, I’m not talking to you. Mind your own business!”<br/>Tracy had a habit of throwing around the word “bitch” like it was nothing. That set Serena off.<br/>“You just called me a bitch?” Serena snapped.<br/>“Yes, I did,” Tracy shot back, “for not minding your own damn business!”.</div>
