        <h1>Chapter 104</h1>
        <div><p>Charles stepped forward, his eyes locked on Norman. His voice was calm, but every word carried weight.</p><p>“Why are you so certain? They searched me—you all saw it. There’s nothing.”</p><p>Norman’s face darkened. “I swear he took it. Maybe he hid it somewhere else. Not in his pocket—maybe he even slipped it into Miss Serena’s bag without her knowing. We should check that too.”</p><p>A wave of disapproval swept through the crowd.</p><p>“That’s too much,” someone muttered. “Disrespectful,” another added. “You can’t accuse her like that,” a third said sharply.</p><p>Mr. Edward frowned, his tone cold. “Seems you don’t know what you’re saying, Norman. You said it was in his pocket, yet we’ve seen nothing.”</p><p>Norman’s jaw tightened. “I know what I’m saying!” he insisted, his voice trembling slightly.</p><p>Charles tilted his head, a faint smirk on his lips. “Well then, since they’ve checked me and found nothing, let them check you too.”</p><p>A hush fell. Several people frowned.</p><p>Norman scoffed, folding his arms. “What are you saying? Don’t try to shift attention.”</p><p>Charles didn’t blink. “We’re not shifting anything. You’re so desperate to prove I took it. Fine—then prove you didn’t. Let them check your body. Who knows? Maybe you’re the one shifting attention.”</p><p>Norman’s composure cracked. “You must be crazy! Are you implying that I stole the wristwatch—and blamed you?”</p><p>Charles shrugged lightly. “Who knows? That’s exactly what I’m suspecting.”</p><p>The crowd buzzed again, the whispers coming fast now.</p><p>“Well, that’s another angle,” one man said thoughtfully.</p><p> Another nodded. “It could be true. Maybe he’s trying to deflect blame.”</p><p>Norman spun toward them, eyes wide, voice rising. “Don’t mind this fool! He’s trying to twist your minds. He’ll sneak away once you all lose focus, he stole it!”</p><p>Serena stepped forward, voice firm and sharp. “And how exactly would he ‘sneak away’ from all of us, Norman? There are guards everywhere.” </p><p>She took a step closer, eyes narrowing. “You said we should search Charles first, and we did. Nothing was found. Now let’s do the same to you—it’s not a harmful thing, right?”</p><p>Gasps and murmurs followed her words. All eyes turned to Norman again. </p><p>Norman stood tall, masking the unease twisting inside him. He was confident—after all, he had planted the wristwatch inside Charles’s pocket himself. </p><p>There was no way it could be found on him. Still, being asked to be searched felt humiliating.</p><p>He frowned and said, “What if they search me and find nothing?”</p><p>Charles stepped forward calmly. “Then I will accept being thrown out of here.”</p><p>The crowd gasped.</p><p>Hearing that, Norman’s lips curled into a sly smile. Good, he thought.  they would find nothing, and Charles would be thrown out, he would take that as a win . </p><p>Maybe the watch had fallen or slipped deeper in Charles’s clothes—that had to be why the guards didn’t find it. Either way, if nothing turned up, Charles would be ruined.</p><p>Serena turned to Charles in panic. “Why would you say that? It’s just a search, like they did to you!”</p><p>Charles didn’t respond to her. His eyes stayed on Norman, cold and steady. “They should just check him.”</p><p>Norman raised his chin proudly, trying to sound unfazed. “Fine. Come and search me real quick.”</p><p>The guards stepped forward again. The room went dead silent. Even the air felt heavy. They began patting him down—his jacket, sleeves, trousers. Norman stood still, confident.</p><p>Then one guard hesitated. His hand brushed against the inside pocket of Norman’s trousers—the one at the back. He frowned, pressed again, then slipped his hand inside.</p><p>For a heartbeat, the room held its breath.</p><p>The guard slowly pulled his hand back—and in it gleamed gold and diamond.</p><p>Mr. Edward’s roar shattered the silence. “What the fuck! That’s my wristwatch! What’s it doing with you, Norman?”</p><p>The room erupted.</p><p>“What!?”</p><p>“He had it all along!”</p><p>“That’s the reason he was shouting so much!”</p><p>“What a bastard—framing another man for what he did”</p><p>“I can’t believe this. All that acting!”</p><p>Norman’s face was drained of color. “No… no, no, wait—I don’t know how the fuck that got into my pocket!” he stammered. “I swear, I don’t know!”</p><p>He turned toward Charles, disbelief and fear twisting his features. Charles stood where he was, quiet, a faint smirk pulling at his mouth.</p><p>In truth, the moment Norman had “accidentally” bumped into him earlier, Charles had felt the shape of the wristwatch slip into his pocket. He knew instantly. That was why he had refused to let Norman search him, so that moment, when Norman first grabbed him, Charles twisted his arm and used that brief motion to slide the watch back into Norman’s own pocket using his flash power. So fast no one saw him. </p><p>Now Norman was staring at him, realization spreading across his face. He knew this was Charles doing.</p><p>Charles met his eyes and said softly, “Guess you should have checked your pockets first.”</p><p>Norman froze. He understood it now. He’d been outplayed—again. And this time, in front of everyone of a theft!. Karma hit him hard.</p><p>Norman gulped. “I swear I don’t know how that ended up in my pocket,” he croaked. “I—, I am sure Charles planted it on me. He framed”</p><p>Serena snapped, voice raw and bright. “I’m tired of all this drama. Norman stole a watch. He lied about my fiancé. Now we found it on him and he still tries to blame Charles? I’m done. I’m leaving.”</p><p>The room froze. The organizers knew the party would collapse if Serena walked out. They moved quickly. People shoved phones forward. Someone had already started filming. Little bright rectangles glowed, recording everything.</p><p>“He is wicked,” someone spat into a phone. “I nearly believed him.”</p><p>“Lying on someone like that. Disgusting!” A woman hissed.</p><p>“Throw him out. Now.”</p><p>Mr. Edward’s face had gone stone. “You have disrespected me. You have disappointed me. Your father would not be proud.” He pointed. “Out. Now.”</p><p>Norman fell to pleading, as he knew, “No—no—this is a misunderstanding. Believe me. Charles planned it. It was his doing”</p><p>Just then, hands grabbed his arms. Two guards seized his jacket. “Any more words, and we will brush your teeth with punches,  leave now, or we will drag you out”.</p><p>Norman staggered. He clawed for words. “No, listen, listen—”</p><p>They bundled him toward the door. A chorus of shouts rode behind:</p><p>“Shame!”</p><p>“Get out!”</p><p>“Theif”.</p><p>Norman’s protests thinned as the corridor opened and cold air hit his face. The crowd pressed forward, hungry for spectacle. Phones recorded his humiliation. </p><p>As Norman was shoved past the door, he screamed once more, raw and hoarse. “Charles really did it. He—”</p><p>They closed his mouth and bundled him out in the most humiliating way.</p></div>
