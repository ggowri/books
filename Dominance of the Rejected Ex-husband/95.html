        <h1>Chapter 95</h1>
        <div><p>Charles frowned hearing about the Titan family for the first time. He didn’t know who they were or what they did, so he asked Lizzypie.</p><p>“You see, basically… The Titan family are thugs. One of the kings of the underworld—brutal, ruthless. But they use business to cover their real deals. Their front is selling stones. And trust me, they sell only real, original stones,” Lizzypie explained.</p><p>Charles listened quietly, unfazed. “All we have to do is give them money for the stones and they’ll give us what we want. So, nothing hard about that.”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded slowly. “Yeah, it should be that simple. But the Titan family is unpredictable… and they only sell to rich and well-known families. They might refuse to sell to you.”</p><p>Still, Charles didn’t see any problem. “Then let’s just go there and ask,” he said. He believed he had enough money—buying a few stones shouldn’t be hard. Just pay them and get what he came for.</p><p>He requested to be discharged immediately. After that, he and Lizzypie headed straight to Titan Corporate. When they arrived, they stood before the massive building, staring at it for a few moments before deciding to go in.</p><p>“What… what is this? What are you two doing here?” someone called out sharply.</p><p>They turned to see Tracy storming toward them, furious.</p><p>Lizzypie sneered at Charles, whispering, “You two must be made for each other. Why do we always run into her everywhere?”</p><p>Charles sighed. He already knew what was coming—Tracy’s usual nagging.</p><p>She stopped right in front of him, face flushed with anger. “Charles, did I ever wrong you? You’re the one who asked for the divorce. I tried to keep our marriage together, but you wanted to leave! So why are you sabotaging me everywhere? Why are you trying to destroy my life?”</p><p>Charles frowned and scoffed. “What the heck are you talking about? Who’s trying to destroy your life?”</p><p>“You, of course!” Tracy snapped. “Don’t pretend. I already know. First, you keep showing up everywhere I go. And now I find out your fiancée is about to be announced as the next IAA recipient. I was told to prepare for it, everything was set—and then, at the last minute, they gave it to your fiancée, Serena!”</p><p>Charles looked genuinely lost. He hadn’t even heard of the IAA until yesterday.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.</p><p>“Oh, you know better!” she shot back. “Do you know how much I spent on this? Trying to impress the right people, being good to everyone? They told me it was mine, Charles, until the last minute! Then they changed their minds and gave it to Serena. It’s obvious you’re behind it!”</p><p>Her voice broke. Her eyes were red, and she looked like she’d actually been crying.</p><p>Then she added softly, “Look, I’m sorry if I ever hurt you. I’ve always loved you, even after the divorce. But you… you’re just cruel. You want to see me fall. And now you are here again—I’m sure you’re here to sabotage me!”</p><p>Charles couldn’t believe her hypocrisy. She was twisting her own failure and blaming him, and also trying to gaslight him that she still loves him. </p><p>He sneered. “Bullshit. If you really care about who’s sabotaging you, go confront Derek and your mother. Not me.”</p><p>Tracy blinked, confused, but Charles didn’t bother explaining. He just turned and walked inside, with Lizzypie following.</p><p>Tracy scoffed. “He’s just mentioning Derek and my mother to distract me,” she muttered bitterly.</p><p>Lately, everything has been going wrong for her. Collaborations were collapsing. Some shareholders had pulled out. And this IAA thing, she had paid several people for that spot, people who had assured her it was hers. Then, suddenly, it went to Serena.</p><p>She was convinced Charles was behind it. Maybe as revenge.</p><p>Now, she was here to buy some stones herself—trying to venture into stone trading like Natasha. But seeing Charles here again only made her more certain he was plotting something.</p><p>She took a deep breath, steadied herself, and walked inside.</p><p>****</p><p>When Charles arrived and told the receptionist what he was there for, he was directed to the CEO of Titan Company — Wilson, the heir of the real owner and head of the Titan family, Mr. Eden.</p><p>Wilson, a young man about Charles’s age, greeted him with a wide smile and easy laughter. He was friendly, polite, and surprisingly calm.</p><p>Charles explained what he came for — to buy some stones.</p><p>“We have stones,” Wilson said. “Fifty stones cost seventy million dollars.”</p><p>Charles still had that money with Lizzypie. After some discussion, they agreed to the deal. Wilson insisted that payment be made before taking them to the stone garage, and Charles didn’t see any problem with that.</p><p>Wilson didn’t look anything like the thug Lizzypie had described. He seemed like a businessman…. clean, well-dressed, and confident.</p><p>When they arrived at the garage, they found Tracy already there. She was also buying stones, and the workers were loading them for her.</p><p>Tracy frowned the moment she saw them, her eyes burning with anger.</p><p>“Ma’am, these are your stones,” one of the staff said politely. Tracy nodded and called her transport truck to come carry them.</p><p>But then Charles noticed something.</p><p>Using his X-ray vision, he scanned the stones — and froze.</p><p>Not a single gem was inside any of them. They were all empty.</p><p>He checked Tracy’s stones again, and it was nothing just like Natasha’s.</p><p>This was a wholesale stone seller, and even though not all stones should contain gems, at least thirty percent normally would. But here, none did.</p><p>Charles’s stomach tightened. If Tracy took those stones home, she would lose everything.</p><p>At first, he wanted to ignore it and just focus on what he came for. But then he scanned the entire garage, every crate, every barrel.</p><p>Shock hit him again. Over a thousand stones here, and not one of them contained a gem.</p><p>Lizzypie had been right. The Titan family was dangerous. They were selling empty stones to customers.</p><p>He wanted to ignore it, pretend he didn’t see and just collect his own money back. But the thought of Tracy walking into ruin, twisted something inside him.</p><p>Tracy was already about to leave when Charles called out sharply.</p><p>“Tracy, wait.”</p><p>She turned, irritated.</p><p>He walked up to her. “Those stones are empty,” he said.</p><p>Wilson’s smile faded, and he raised an eyebrow.</p></div>
