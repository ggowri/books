        <h1>Chapter 138</h1>
        <div>The judge cleared his throat. “Well… this evidence will not be admitted. You can later be charged with perjury if it’s found to have been tampered with.”<br/>Lizzypie remained calm. “My lord, we have a witness who can testify to exactly what happened.”<br/>Wilson’s frown deepened. Who could it be?<br/>The courtroom door opened. All eyes turned as Norman rolled in on a wheelchair.<br/>Wilson’s voice cracked, muttering at himself. “What… What's he doing here? And in a wheelchair?”.<br/>The prosecutor was shocked to see him also, and yelled, “My lord, this… this witness wasn’t properly vetted!”<br/>Lizzypie stepped forward, unfazed. “We will explain why he wasn’t called earlier, your honor. You will understand everything shortly.”<br/>The prosecutor snapped, “Your honor, this should not—”<br/>Lizzypie held up a hand, locking eyes with the judge. “Please, my lord, hear him out. Once you do, the truth will be clear.”<br/>The judge sighed, then nodded slowly. “Very well. The court will allow the witness to speak. Proceed.”<br/>Norman’s fingers trembled slightly on the wheels as he drove forward. He was cleared to speak. <br/>He began, “I… I saw exactly what happened that night. I know who killed Mr. Eden—and it wasn’t Charles.”<br/>“What!... what Is he saying!”.<br/>“He saw it?. He could go to prison for this?”.<br/>Everyone started muttering. <br/>Lizzypie chimed in. “Norman, you said you saw the person who did it. Who was it?”<br/>Norman swallowed hard. His hand trembled as he lifted it… then slowly pointed straight at Wilson.<br/>A stunned gasp rolled across the courtroom.<br/>Wilson shot to his feet, chair screeching back. “What the fuck are you saying? You think this court will believe you just because you pointed at me?”<br/>Norman didn’t flinch. “I have the evidence that you did it.”<br/>Wilson scoffed. “What… what? Evidence?”<br/>Norman reached into the side pocket of his wheelchair and pulled out a phone then opened a video folder.<br/>Lizzypie stepped aside as the video feed hit the courtroom screen.<br/>The footage played. Wilson stood over his father in a dim room. Wilson’s face twisted with rage as he stabbed him again and again. All was on the video which made it undeniable that he killed his father. <br/>“What…” Wilson staggered back. “That… that is fake.” he kept denying it.<br/>Lizzypie shook her head. “It’s not. We vetted it already and passed the authentic  check”<br/>It turned out that night, Wilson had already planned to kill his father. He found out his father had an illegitimate son and intended to give that son most of the inheritance. Wilson was only set to receive a small share. He told Norman everything. That was the reason he killed him that night, and  Norman was secretly recording it.<br/>The courtroom erupted again.<br/>The judge slammed the gavel. “Order!”<br/>A panelist asked, “But… What about the voice recording that said Charles killed him? That went through a professional check.”<br/>Norman raised his voice. “It was fake. The original was tampered with. Wilson paid the prosecutor to lie.”<br/>Wilson’s face was drained of color.<br/>Norman continued. “They sent the money back and forth through my account so it wouldn’t look suspicious. But I kept everything.”<br/>The prosecutor’s jaw dropped. “Why are you lying? This is perjury. They are trying to frame me!”<br/>Norman unlocked his phone and held it up again. On the phone, there were transactions, messages and even some voice recordings. Which clearly showed that the prosecutor was in it with Wilson. That was how they frame Charles perfectly.<br/>“what?, I can't believe this… so they are framing that guy”.<br/>“That man was innocent”.<br/>They were referring to Charles, who just calmly sat down. <br/>Meanwhile,  Wilson, knew he was fucked up, he had been exposed and due to this, he would be arrested. <br/>He immediately stood up and then brought out a gun.  The courtroom froze as Wilson pulled out the gun.<br/>For some moment no one moved. Then everywhere turned chaos <br/>People screamed. Chairs scraped as they drove under the table<br/>Boom!<br/>Boom!!<br/>Wilson made two warning shot in the air, The blasts shook the room.<br/>The judge ducked behind the bench, voice cracking. “What are you doing!”<br/>Wilson swung the gun at him. “I’m going to walk out of here and you will do nothing, or I’ll kill you right here!”<br/>“what the fuck, he is crazy”.<br/>“Someone please save us and collect the gun from him”.<br/>He was immediately surrounded by the two police officers that were present. But they couldn't shoot because Wilson was threatening innocent people. If things went wrong, he might really shoot one of them.<br/>Charles scoffed, stood up, and walked toward him like the gun meant nothing.<br/>Wilson jerked the muzzle toward him. “Fuck! Take one more step and I will kill an innocent person right now!”<br/>Charles kept walking. “You’re being reckless. Do you really think you can walk out of here?”<br/>“I have my men outside!” Wilson barked. His hand shook but his eyes were wild. “Their cars are waiting. As soon as I step out, I’m gone. They might even come in and kill everyone here!”<br/>Charles let out a dry laugh. “You think those men will still work for you after it was revealed you killed their boss?”<br/>Wilson gulped hard. His eyes twitched. “That old fucker deserved to die! And the Titan family listens to me. They will forever serve me!”<br/>Charles just shook his head. “Drop the gun now.”<br/>Wilson screamed, waving the gun. “I said move! I will shoot you and anyone that acts funny!”<br/>Charles smiled,  then raised his hands like he was surrendering.<br/>Behind him, Norman began moving  backward towards the door. He was escaping. <br/>Just then….. Swwrrrrrr<br/>Charles flashed forward so fast Wilson didn’t even see him coming.<br/> The gun was knocked from Wilson’s hand and clattered across the floor. In the same breath Charles hooked his arm, twisted his balance, and flipped him over.<br/>Thud!!!!<br/>He hit the ground so hard.</div>
