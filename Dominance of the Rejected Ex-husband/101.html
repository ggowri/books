        <h1>Chapter 101</h1>
        <div><p>Serena was furious, fuming from the inside out, but she kept her chin high. </p><p>What Tracy had just called her was beyond insulting. As the daughter of the Moretti family, Serena knew her status carried weight. She had the power, reputation, to step on Tracy and make her eat grass for what she said.</p><p>Tracy should have known better than to provoke her.</p><p>But Serena stayed calm. For now.</p><p>“I don’t want any commotion today,” she said coldly, “Be grateful for that… or lose your tongue. I swear I’ll rip it out of your mouth.”</p><p>Tracy gave a dry laugh. “Oh, I won’t be surprised if you do. You’re that kind of bitch who rides on her father’s wealth and power. You use your name to crush others. That’s all you’re good at, you fucking bitch!”</p><p>That word—bitch—made something snap in Serena. Her patience broke like glass. Her body moved before her mind caught up. She stepped forward, fury flashing in her eyes, and raised her hand to slap Tracy.</p><p>But before she could, Charles caught her wrist.</p><p>His grip was firm. “Don’t,” he said in a low voice. “This is exactly what she wants. She wants to make you lose control. If you do, she’ll use it against you. She will paint you as the violent, spoiled Moretti daughter and ruin your image.”</p><p>Serena glared at Tracy, biting her lip hard. She slowly pulled her hand back. Charles was right—she couldn’t let this fool bait her tonight.</p><p>She frowned and said, “Why are you doing this, Tracy? What’s your problem?”</p><p>Tracy folded her arms, her voice shaking with fury. “Stop pretending you don’t know. You took what’s mine!” </p><p>Her voice grew louder, drawing the eyes of a few nearby guests. “Today was supposed to be about me. I should have been the one standing on that stage as Business Woman of the Year. I spent money. I met the right people. I made connections. They told me I’d be the one to win! Then, out of nowhere, the result changed—and you got it instead. You and your filthy fiancé stole my success!”</p><p>Her full breasts rose and fell with her anger.</p><p>Charles frowned deeply. “Wait, you think Serena took your spot? You really believe she rigged the result?”</p><p>“Don’t act clueless!” Tracy snapped, pointing at him. “You’re both in this together. You did it deliberately to humiliate me. Especially you, Charles—you wanted payback for what happened between us. You blocked my chance and gave the award to your fiancée. You are a wicked, manipulative man!”</p><p>Serena stepped closer to her, her tone colder now, words deliberate. “So, if I understand correctly… you bribed people to make sure you’d win. Then when it didn’t work, you decided to blame me?” She tilted her head slightly. “You should be questioning your brain, Tracy. Maybe those people scammed you.”</p><p>Tracy’s nostrils flared. “Shut up! It wasn’t bribery. I just paid a few people to handle things behind the scenes. It was mine! You stole it, you witch! Don’t twist things around.”</p><p>Serena gave a small, cruel smile. “Do you really think I would stoop that low for something like this? I already have enough influence and power to be recognized without paying anyone. I was invited here, that’s all. Why would I spend my time and money fighting for something that should have been earned on merit? Especially against someone as petty and small-minded as you.”</p><p>Tracy’s fury exploded. “You bitch! Watch your mouth!” she screamed and lunged forward again.</p><p>Charles immediately stepped between them, pushing her back slightly with one arm. His voice was firm. “Can you please, you both should stay calm. This is no place to fight”</p><p>Tracy glared at him. “Oh, of course you’d say that. You’re protecting your asset—what you worked so hard for. You think you can play the noble man while hiding behind her money and name. You went as far as sabotaging me just to make her shine.”</p><p>Charles looked at her, baffled and disgusted. “You’re talking nonsense, Tracy. I didn’t even know about this banquet until today. And Serena isn’t the kind of person who cheats for titles. You’re delusional.”</p><p>Serena exhaled through her nose and took Charles’s hand. “Babe, let’s just go inside. People are already staring. This trash isn’t worth our attention.”</p><p>Her calm dismissal hit Tracy harder than a slap. Her face twisted with rage and humiliation, but she couldn’t do anything. She watched as Serena and Charles walked away, fingers interlocked, heads high.</p><p>Around them, people turned, whispering, smiling, greeting Serena, shaking Charles’s hand. They looked like the perfect couple. Powerful, composed, and untouchable.</p><p>Tracy stood frozen for a moment, her fists trembling. Then Derek reached for her arm. “Tracy, hey, calm down…”</p><p>“Leave me alone!” she hissed, jerking away. “I want to be alone!”</p><p>She stormed off, her heels clicking hard against the marble floor, leaving Derek and Mrs. Hailey standing there.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey sighed heavily. “She’s really upset. She worked so hard for this moment. And then that… animal just snatched it away. I’m sure Serena pulled strings.”</p><p>Derek smirked, his tone calm but dangerous. “You don’t have to worry about that, Mrs. Hailey. The night belongs to Tracy . Before it ends, Charles and Serena will face humiliation worse than they can imagine.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey turned toward him, her brow furrowing. “What are you planning, Derek?”</p><p>Derek slipped his hands into his pockets, leaning close. “You remember Charles’s sex tape? The one with that beautiful woman who’s always hanging around him? I still have a copy. I’m going to make it public. Once everyone sees it, it’s over for him.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey’s eyes widened. Then her face broke into a grin. “That’s brilliant. Once that video goes out, everyone will know he’s been cheating. He’ll be humiliated. And Serena—oh, she’ll be destroyed. Her image, her reputation will be gone. Especially tonight, when she’s being honored by the IAA. It will ruin everything for her.”</p><p>Derek gave a dark chuckle. “Exactly”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey nodded approvingly. “I love it. You have always known how to take care of my daughter… and me.”</p><p>Meanwhile, inside the banquet hall, Serena and Charles had completely stolen the spotlight. The hall glittered with chandeliers, the air thick with perfume and pride.</p><p> Everyone wanted a handshake, a smile, a picture.</p><p>But in the far corner, Norman sat alone with a glass of wine and a storm brewing behind his eyes. He felt like killing Charles. </p><p>Charles had humiliated him more than once. And worse he had taken the woman Norman wanted.</p><p>Now, watching them bask in the crowd’s attention, Norman was more angry. </p><p>It should have been me, he thought. He doesn’t deserve her. He doesn’t deserve this.</p><p>Then an idea crawls into his mind. Something sinister and perfect. He glanced at the table near him, where a man had just left—a rich figure from one of the top families, Mr. Edward. On the table, glittering under the lights, was a luxury wristwatch.</p><p>Norman looked around, making sure one was watching.</p><p>Quietly, he reached out, took the watch, and slipped it into his pocket. His lips curled into a smile.</p><p>His plan was simple. Plant the watch in Charles’s pocket. Accuse him of theft. </p><p>He sneered, “Finally, I&#x27;m taking my revenge, there is no way you will find your way out of this!”.</p></div>
