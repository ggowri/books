        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div>“What the hell are you doing here!” Tracy yelled as soon as she set her eyes on Charles.<br/>Charles stared at her, debating whether to tell her what he had just witnessed. He even had the evidence…it wouldn’t be hard to prove it to her. Part of him wanted to let her know; she didn’t deserve this, even despite their broken relationship and her betrayal.<br/>“Tracy…” he began.<br/>Tracy immediately cut him off. “Just hang it there. So, you are here to apologize, huh? I knew you would come back. I knew you would regret it! Now you have no place to sleep, and here you are.”<br/>Charles couldn’t believe Tracy was still stuck in her own delusions, convincing herself that he would come crawling back.<br/>“Who told you I’m here to come back?” Charles shot back.<br/>“Isn’t that what you are here for? Your little plan yesterday failed! How could you present a fake ring, thinking you could win Serena’s heart and buy your way out of your filthy, poverty-stricken life? Haha! They must have found out it was fake. Your plan failed, and now you are here to beg me!” Tracy spat.<br/>Charles could only shake his head at her arrogance. He decided this wasn’t the best time to tell her about Derek and her mother.<br/>But Tracy wouldn’t stop. “You know Derek signed a multi-million dollar deal yesterday. He’s rich now, and he can give me the life I have always wanted. So this is your last chance..just say how sorry you are.”<br/>Charles stood there, nodding slightly, though his thoughts were elsewhere. Tracy had no idea what was really happening inside her own house, in her own bedroom. She was blind to the truth, wrapped in arrogance, pride, and denial of her own misdeeds.<br/>“Whatever,” Charles finally said. “Keep dreaming. The last thing I will ever do is to come back to you.”<br/>He turned to leave.<br/>“Stop being stubborn!” Tracy yelled after him. “You have no choice but me. You will come back, you poor man!”<br/>Charles ignored her and kept walking, hoping Tracy would catch them by herself . But just as he reached the front of his hotel, three cars suddenly cut him off.<br/>He stepped back cautiously, eyes narrowing, trying to figure out who they were. Then the doors opened, and nearly ten men climbed out.<br/>His heart thudded as he recognized one of them…Fred, Serena’s bodyguard.<br/>What the hell was he doing here?. <br/>Charles froze as Fred stepped forward.<br/>“Mr. Charles,” Fred said evenly, “ Ms. Serena would like to see you.”<br/>Charles blinked, his heart skipping. “Really?” The excitement slipped through his usually calm tone.<br/>Fred simply nodded and pulled open the back door of the sleek black car. “If you may.”<br/>“Sure,” Charles replied quickly, wasting no time as he slid into the seat. <br/>As the car pulled away, his mind raced. Why had Serena called for him? What could she possibly want? Whatever it was, he told himself one thing for certain…he had managed to catch her attention and his trails were progressing.<br/>When they finally pulled into a gated compound, Charles looked out the window and realized where they were. A private gun range, guarded and secluded.<br/>Fred gestured for him to step out. Charles obeyed, his pulse climbing and walked in.<br/>Inside, the sharp cracks of gunfire rang out. <br/>Thud. Thud. Thud. <br/>Each shot echoed like a hammer to the chest. Charles followed the sound, then froze as his eyes found her.<br/>Serena.<br/>She stood with perfect posture, a pistol in her hands, her gaze narrowed as she aimed at the target dummy ahead. Three precise shots…straight to the heart, all in the exact same place. <br/>badass!<br/>Charles flinched, instinctively pressing a hand to his own chest as if the bullets had torn through him.<br/>When Serena finally lowered the gun, she exhaled slowly, then dropped the weapon onto the table with a metallic clatter. She brushed her long hair back, letting it flare and settle around her shoulders as she turned. <br/>Charles couldn’t stop himself…his throat tightened, and he swallowed hard, caught between awe and desire. She was devastatingly beautiful. <br/>Today, Her figure 8 showed more, and her big hips were alluring.<br/>He bowed slightly, “Ms. Serena.”<br/>Serena studied him for a long beat, the smile on her face slow and unreadable.<br/> “Charles, right?” she said at last.<br/>He nodded, throat tight. “Yes.”<br/>“That was quite a drama yesterday.” She said,  “And I can say you truly amazed me with your bravery.”<br/>A small, stupid thrill ran through him. He smiled, feeling briefly accomplished.<br/>Serena reached into her coat and produced the little ring box. She set it on the table between them. <br/>“Take this,” she said. “I can’t keep it.”<br/>Charles blinked. “What? Did I…did I offend you? Why are you returning your gift?”<br/>Serena’s eyes were steady. <br/>“I understand what happened yesterday. You are…poor, Charles. You couldn’t possibly afford something like this.” She tapped the box with a fingertip.<br/>He opened his mouth, started to protest, “It’s original, and I didn’t steal it”.<br/>“That's… the reason I am returning it. I ran a check on it yesterday and it is original. If it is fake I might keep it out of pity. But it’s real. And you are not the sort of man that can afford it.” She gently said.<br/>Hearing her words. Charles felt down. Especially the part where she talked about being poor. Serena could read his face.<br/>“I don’t mean to be rude,” she said quickly, softer now. <br/>“You saved me yesterday. You surprised me. The Moretti family can provide…anything. Money. A house. An island, Anything of your taste. Name it.” She said<br/>Charles felt his pulse spike. He immediately sees this as an opportunity. He swallowed and met her gaze. “I can really ask for anything?”.<br/>“Anything,” she confirmed, smiling back in place.<br/>He steadied himself. His eyes went to where the gun was and Fred was behind him. He knew this could cause him his life.<br/>He gulped and took the risk anyway  “I will be straightforward, Ms. Serena. If you want to repay me. Get engaged to me”.</div>
