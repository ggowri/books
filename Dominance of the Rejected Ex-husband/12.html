        <h1>Chapter 12.</h1>
        <div>“No way… this can’t be happening,” she muttered under her breath.<br/>“Charles, you think I can’t see through your act? You’re just holding out, waiting for me to give in. Well, I will never back down.” Shaken by his determination, she climbed into her car.<br/>Tears pricked her eyes as she slammed her fist against the steering wheel. “Charles, I gave you a chance today, and you threw it away,” she hissed, her voice trembling with anger.<br/>“Fine. I will make you regret every decision you’ve made.” Her tears glistened but refused to fall.<br/>She sat for a moment, steadying her breath until her cool, composed demeanor returned. After a brief pause, she pulled out her phone and dialed Derek. The call connected almost instantly.<br/>“Tracy? Wow, what a surprise! What’s going on?” Derek’s voice was warm, brimming with excitement.<br/>“Nothing major, Derek. I just missed you,” Tracy said, her tone softening, almost nostalgic.<br/>“What?” Derek paused, then broke into a wide grin, his heart lifting. “I miss you too, Tracy!”<br/>“Are you free tonight?” she asked.<br/>“Absolutely! What’s the plan?” he asked eagerly.<br/>“How about letting Francis watch some cartoons at home, and you and I grab a drink at the bar? Sounds good?” A charming smile curved her lips.<br/>“Hell yes, that’s perfect! I’ll be ready!” Derek replied without hesitation, his excitement spilling over.<br/>“Great. See you soon,” Tracy said, ending the call. She didn’t drive away immediately. Instead, she made another call to Mr. Zoe.<br/>“Ms. Tracy, what can I do for you?” Mr. Zoe answered promptly.<br/>“Tonight, I’m going out with Derek to the bar. Be discreet, but make sure Charles knows I’m with him. Understood?” Tracy instructed.<br/>“Uh… got it,” Mr. Zoe replied, caught off guard but quick to agree.<br/>Tracy hung up. Mr. Zoe stared at his phone, a frown creasing his brow.<br/>“Why is Ms. Tracy getting stranger by the day…?” he muttered.<br/>Meanwhile, free from Tracy’s shadow, Charles wandered the city streets, feeling lighter than he had in years, his thoughts turning to the future.<br/>His firefighter’s salary was solid, but compared to Tracy’s company empire, it was just a fragment.<br/>When they married, he had poured half his savings into their villa, making it joint property. Back then, Tracy wasn’t that wealthy, so they combined their money to build it together.<br/>The cars? All purchased by Tracy.<br/>The savings? Mostly hers too.<br/>Charles didn’t care about the cars or the accounts.<br/>But half of that villa was his. He had poured everything into it, draining his savings and even mortgaging his parents’ old home to Tracy to cover his share.<br/>Even if he walked away with nothing else, he’d fight to reclaim his  house.<br/> Charles realized five years of marriage had left him with little. But he didn’t mind. Freedom from a woman who never truly loved him was worth more than any material loss.<br/>Still, he needed a place to stay. His bank account was nearly empty. He had considered a hotel for a few nights, but Tracy’s sudden eagerness to push the divorce made him wary. She might pull some trick on Monday to delay things. Hotels were expensive, and renting made more sense. Since he had a stable job in the city and no plans to return to his hometown after the divorce, renting was the practical choice.<br/>After some thought, he spotted a real estate agency nearby, dragged his suitcase inside, and explained his needs and budget to the agent.<br/>The day passed quickly. By evening, Charles had toured several properties and finally found one he liked. But the rent was higher than he expected…$1,500 to cover the first month’s costs. He only had $1,200 left, and he still needed money for food.<br/>“Mrs. Dorris, please, can you help me here? I don’t have the full amount with me. Can I pay half now and settle the rest before next week?” he asked.<br/>The house owner, a woman in her forties, leaned back in her chair, chewing gum loudly. Her makeup was overdone, thick red lipstick that bled at the corners, heavy eyeliner, and powder caked unevenly on her face. She looked Charles up and down with a sly squint.<br/>“Uhn… half?” she drawled, snapping her gum. “I don’t take half. This is already the cheapest house you will ever find here.”<br/>Charles nodded, calm but desperate.<br/>“I know. I can testify to that. But I don’t have the full amount with me now. What about this...let me pay $1,000 today. I will balance up next week”.<br/> He was planning on using the  $200 just to feed himself.<br/>The woman tilted her head, and scanned him up and down.  Her eyes lingered on him in a way that made Charles uncomfortable.<br/>“As handsome as you are,” she said, smirking, “you are still a broke man.”<br/>“Please,” Charles said quietly, his tone firm but respectful.<br/>The woman narrowed her eyes, chewing slowly as if weighing something. Then she leaned forward, her perfume heavy and sweet, almost suffocating.<br/>“You married?” she asked bluntly.<br/>“No,” Charles replied after a pause. He wasn’t lying, Tracy was out of his life already, even without the papers signed.<br/>Her expression shifted strangely, lips curling into a mischievous smile.<br/>“Mhm… so you are single now. You’ve got muscles too. What work do you do?”<br/>“Firefighter,” Charles answered flatly.<br/>She leaned back in her chair and gave a low chuckle.<br/>“How about coming over and putting out the fire in my hole, firefighter?” she whispered, her voice suddenly filthy. Then placed her hands on him, and slid it down  beneath Charles.<br/>Charles froze, his jaw tightening. He could see where this was going.<br/>“What? I’m married. What is this nonsense?” he said firmly, shutting her down.<br/>Unbothered, the woman adjusted her blouse, pushing up her breast, her voice dropping lower.<br/>“Relax, sweetie. I just want you over me. One night. You won’t have to pay a dime for this month’s rent, not even the agreement or commission. Everything will be free.”<br/>Charles’s eyes widened in shock. The woman was literally offering him a place to stay in exchange for sex.</div>
