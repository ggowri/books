        <h1>chapter 74</h1>
        <div><p>Charles and Lizzypie were on their way home.</p><p>His eyes stayed fixed on the road, hands gripping the steering wheel tight.</p><p>Lizzypie cleared her throat before speaking.</p><p>“Uhm… your ex-wife. Are you still in love with her?”</p><p>Charles frowned and scoffed at the same time. “No. Why would I be? Why are you asking?”</p><p>“It’s just that…” she hesitated. “You two never seem to let go of each other. Every time you meet, you talk. You can’t let her go — and she can’t let you.”</p><p>Charles chuckled dryly. “I don’t understand what you’re saying. Tracy’s just full of pride. She’ll always try to make everything about her. That’s why we clash whenever we meet. It doesn’t mean we’re still emotionally attached.”</p><p>But Lizzypie didn’t let it go.</p><p>“Still… you offered her a ride. You pity her. But remember your second mission — time’s running out. Grandfather gave us a two-week deadline. You have to make her lose everything, Charles. That’s the mission.”</p><p>Charles didn’t respond. His jaw tightened, eyes narrowing at the dark stretch of highway ahead.</p><p>Then his phone buzzed. The name on the screen made Lizzypie scoff.</p><p>“Here she is — the ex-wife herself.”</p><p>Charles hesitated. He didn’t want to answer. But the memory of her standing in the cold came back to him. What if something happened?</p><p>He picked up. “Hello?”</p><p>“HELLO, CHARLES!” Tracy’s voice was shaking, almost panicked.</p><p>He straightened. “Tracy? What happened?”</p><p>“Listen— you have to turn around. Right now! I mean it— turn around, Charles!”</p><p>Her voice cracked, breathless, desperate.</p><p>“What is it?” Charles snapped into the phone.</p><p>“Norman—he wants you dead. He said ram you off the road. He’s hired someone. They’re coming—now. Turn around, Charles. Please, turn around.” Tracy’s voice was a knife.</p><p>“Really?” Charles heard Lizzypie behind him, sharp: “Turn. Now.”</p><p>Tracy didn’t have time to answer. </p><p>TOOOOM!!!!</p><p>From the left, a fat van was rushing at them like a battering ram. Its headlights were too bright, shining straight in their eyes.</p><p>TOOOM!!! </p><p>Another car appeared from behind them, closing fast. There was no way forward and no room to back.</p><p>“Charles!” Lizzypie screamed.</p><p>Charles’ hands locked on the wheel. </p><p>{EYES OF SATAN ACTIVATED}.</p><p>He  then stomped the brake. The rear car surged, trying to push them into the van. The van lunged, metal screaming against metal as it clipped Charles’ passenger door. The first hit was a thud.</p><p>Charles yanked the wheel left. Tires protested. He downshifted with his knee, felt the car bite. The van’s bumper glanced at their back wheel—then slid. </p><p>The impact would have spun most men, but Charles fed the slide, countered, letting momentum carry them past the van’s nose. The van’s driver overcorrected; their momentum threw the van onto the curb. It punched a lamppost and shuddered to a halt.</p><p>The second car tried to shove them into the crushed lane. </p><p>Charles slammed the gearstick, slammed the accelerator. The engine answered with a roar. He cut a hard right, clipped the curb, felt the car climb the pavement for a breath, then drop back onto the road.</p><p>Glass rattled as the radiator hissed somewhere behind them. This made the tire fire up and screeched, this made the car stop.</p><p>The car screeched to a stop. Smoke poured all over the car, and inside it. Charles coughed as  he yanked open his door. He shoved Lizzypie out, they both stumbled out.</p><p>Five men spilled from the van. They dressed In black coats, and the leader of them stepped forward. </p><p>“Wow. That was exceptional of you” He spat the name.</p><p> “What the heck are you doing? Did Norman really send you to kill me?”, Charles demanded</p><p>The leader’s smile. He nodded to his men. “Since you already know why we’re here, let’s make this easy. I’m here to kill you.” He jerked his chin toward Lizzypie. “Pity. This beauty goes with you.”</p><p>He drew a gun and aimed. The alley was narrow. It was quiet and no one could see them. Just as the leader’s hand hover on the trigger. Charles so fast and stepped out of the way.</p><p>BOOM!!!</p><p>The gun barked but the bullet screamed past, hitting the car where Charles had stood. </p><p>In a blink Charles shoved hard, shoulder into metal and drove the leader back against the van as the gun flew out of his hand.</p><p>A thug rushed him, Charles grabbed his arm and slammed him into the van. Another came swinging a baton, Charles hooked an elbow and dropped him cold.</p><p>Lizzypie moved quickly as she intervened, snatched the gun from the ground and smashed the butt into a thug’s ribs, he folded over.</p><p>The leader pulled a knife, Charles caught his wrist and twisted his hand, this made the blade slip, and Charles drove a knee into his gut, he fell. In a matter of minutes, the thugs were all on the floor groaning. </p><p>Charles and Lizzypie breathed hard as Lizzypie bent down, picked up the gun, and pointed it at them. Her eyes were so dark and fixed it was obvious she was going to shoot.</p><p>“Hey, what are you doing?” Charles asked carefully.</p><p>“What do you think? Killing them, of course. We have to send a message to Norman so she won’t dare try this again. We will kill them,” she said simply.</p><p>Charles gulped. He knew Lizzypie was right, but he didn’t want to kill anyone or watch her kill someone.</p><p>“I think this is enough — he’ll get the message. We beat them pretty bad already,” Charles told her.</p><p>Lizzypie was seething. The leader sneered, “Hah! You bitch. You better kill us now, or else we will keep coming for you! We are the Cheetah gang and we will have our revenge.” He laughed hysterically.</p><p>Boom!!!</p><p>Lizzypie pulled the trigger and sent a bullet into the leader’s head. </p><p>He dropped. </p><p>Charles’ eyes popped in shock.</p><p></p></div>
