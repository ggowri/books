        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div>They arrived at Lizzy Pie’s place, a towering penthouse on the 70th floor of a hundred-story building. It was called the Hera Penthouse, meant for people of power.<br/>Inside the massive suite, Charles couldn’t help but be amazed at the spacious layout and the elegant lighting. Everything looked so refined.<br/>“So, you’ll be living here with me,” Lizzy Pie said.<br/>Charles nodded, then asked, “Hmm. Aside from this room you’re offering me, did my grandfather give you anything else as part of my reward?”<br/>Lizzy Pie scoffed. “You bet. I’m excellent at fighting, hacking, disguising, basically all those ninja skills. Mr. Vincent asked me to give you all the basics for free. But some things, you will have to earn. They are premium.”<br/>“Premium? What are they?” he asked curiously.<br/>“You will find out when the time comes,” she replied, then showed Charles his wardrobe. He gasped at the quality, the finely tailored clothes neatly arranged on hangers.<br/>After showing him around, Charles asked, “Also, I’m curious… What can I do to unlock my Level 2 Satan Eyes?” He looked at her, hoping she might know.<br/>“That’s for you to figure out, also for you to know, level 2 of Satan eyes will give you X-ray power” she said, unbuttoning the top of her shirt until the upper curve of her breasts bounced free.<br/>Charles gulped, staring before he could stop himself.<br/>“What are you looking at, pervert? My breasts?” she shrieked.<br/>He immediately pulled back. “I… I wasn’t looking at your breasts.”<br/>“Haha, stop lying—you were! I understand. I’m beautiful, so it’s natural to look. But you  deem me not worthy some moment ago, I might have given them to you. But now, you will have to earn it!” she teased, smirking.<br/>Charles was about to reply when his phone beeped with a new message from Serena. He quickly checked it.<br/><Mr. Vasilios is having a party tomorrow night to celebrate her daughter's engagement. I want us to be there as a couple, so prepare yourself.><br/>Charles was a little shocked by the message. He had just gotten engaged to Serena today, and now he was already being invited to a high-profile social party. A party of that level felt far above him…he wasn’t ready for such circles. Not after Serena's birthday issues.<br/>He sighed and told Lizzy Pie about it.<br/>She only shrugged. “Well, that’s your problem to figure out. If you can’t handle one party, then you are not ready at all.” Her voice was calm but carried a sharp edge.<br/>Then, stretching her arms lazily, she said, “Anyway, I’m going to take a bath. You should get some rest too.”<br/>Without waiting for his response, Lizzy Pie disappeared into the bathroom, leaving Charles alone in the massive room. <br/>*****<br/>The next day, evening came so fast. At the night banquet, where the lights sparkled around the beautifully set event filled with expensive items and decorations, it looked more like a paradise.<br/>Tracy was the first person to arrive at the party, showcasing a sense of punctuality in a stunning blue short gown. The attendees raised their eyes to the beauty that had just entered.<br/>Tracy wanted some collaboration with Mr. Vasilios, that was the reason she was here. She had everyone behind her except Mr. Vasilios, so she wanted to impress him today.<br/>Just then, Derek also arrived.<br/>Tracy was excited to see him. “Wow, you came… I thought you said you’d be busy with Francis.”<br/>Derek nodded. “Yeah, I came to support you and will do anything to make Mr. Vasilios the collaborator. I’m close to him. Also, Francis is with my sister, so he’ll be fine.”<br/>Tracy smiled. “Thank you.”<br/>Then Derek excused himself, saying he wanted to have some talks with a few people.<br/>Outside the venue, a Ferrari sports car arrived, and people immediately knew who owned it.<br/>Serena!.<br/>Cameras started flashing around, everyone eager to capture her. Then the door opened, and Serena was the first person to come out of the car. She wore a long red gown, off-shoulder, stunning as always. People went crazy seeing her again…everyone wished to be just like her, beside her was Fred, the bodyguard.<br/>After that, Charles stepped out of the car in a sharp black suit, the crisp white shirt and polished shoes highlighting his handsome, commanding presence. Lizzypie had gone all out to make him look astonishing.<br/>“Wow, that’s the guy! That must be the lucky man Serena is engaged to.”<br/>“He’s certainly from a wealthy family.”<br/>“He might be a top mafia leader. Look at how handsome and manly he is!”.<br/>Tracy was seething with anger as she saw Charles. She saw it as an opportunity to talk to him, so she immediately walked over.<br/>“Hello, Charles.”<br/>“Hello, Tracy,” Charles replied casually.<br/>“I’d like to talk to you, please,” Tracy requested.<br/>“I don’t want to talk with you, please. As you can see, I’m with my fiancée,” Charles said.<br/>This made Tracy burn even more with rage, but she kept it cool. “Let’s just talk for a moment—it’s really urgent.”<br/>Serena, with hostility in her voice, asked, “Who is she, please?”<br/>“My ex-wife. We divorced already,” he answered.<br/>Serena scoffed and faced her. “Nice meeting you again,” she said, offering a handshake, which they exchanged.<br/>“You didn’t tell me you were friends with her during our marriage. We divorced, and you just got engaged with her,” Tracy said.<br/>“Why should I tell you? It’s none of your business,” Charles replied.<br/>“Okay, okay… I just want to talk to you, straighten something out,” Tracy said.<br/>“What is that? Say it here,” Charles coldly replied.<br/>“It’s something private, meant to be discussed between you and me. Withdraw any third party,” Tracy insisted.<br/>Charles stood his ground. “Either you say it here or nothing. I’m not following you anywhere.”<br/>“Why are you so cold to me? At least hear what I have to say,” Tracy demanded furiously.<br/>“Please, I don’t want any misunderstanding. Either we talk here or not at all. As you know, I’m here with my fiancée,” he stated.<br/>“Why are you ignoring me this much? You were not like this before. What makes you so changed and cold?”<br/>“Just as I said, I don’t want any misunderstanding. We have divorced. What could a lowlife like me be doing with someone of high standard like you?”<br/>Tracy was furious, in a hell of rage, believing Charles’s coldness was due to Serena. She suddenly became jealous.<br/>“I know you’re doing this because of her. We just broke up, and you are already with someone else. You don’t even respect our relationship!”<br/>Charles scoffed. “I can’t believe you’re talking about respect. What about you? You and Derek…aren’t the two of you in a relationship?”<br/>“Who told you I’m in a relationship with him? Stop bringing up irrelevant things to justify your actions.”<br/>“Well, seeing you with someone in a hotel, ordering condoms and lube is what?”<br/>“You are mixing things up here. That’s why I’m asking us to talk!”<br/>Just then, Derek appeared, approaching them.<br/>“Indeed. You two aren’t in a relationship, but he always follows you around,” Charles chuckled.<br/>Tracy exhaled loudly, choosing not to say anything.<br/>“Tracy, here you are. I’ve been looking for you,” Derek said, then noticed Serena and Charles together.<br/>He was furious to see Serena with her arms around Charles. Everyone in the city wanted Serana, even him.  And Charles just got engaged with her, just like that. <br/>To embarrass him, he said, “Isn’t this that lowlife husband of yours? That did not support your career and divorce you because of a little misunderstanding after you fed him for years”.</div>
