        <h1>Chapter 83</h1>
        <div><p>The doctor knew everything was over for him — how would he survive without his work? Without his license there was nothing he could do in medicine. He hadn’t expected this ordinary man, who wasn’t even a doctor, to treat what he had spent years trying to fix. In truth, he was the most talented doctor in the city.</p><p>“What? Give up my license? That’s impossible. I can’t do that.” He wailed.</p><p>But Charles stepped closer. “We had a bet. Give up your license right now.”</p><p>The doctor looked at Mr. Vasilios as if pleading for help. </p><p>Mr. Vasilios added, “You should do as he says. Give up your license — because if he had failed, I’m sure you would have humiliated him.”</p><p>With that, the doctor knew there was no way out. He immediately dropped to his knees and sobbed, “Please forgive me. I was arrogant and ignorant. I thought it was impossible to treat him; I’ve spent years and still couldn’t find a solution. Please forgive me. I beg you.”</p><p>Kyle chimed in, “Please forgive him… he’s been my best friend all these years. He was always there for me. I know how shocked he would be for someone to treat him like that. I’m still in shock.”</p><p>Because of what Kyle said, Charles decided to let it drop — but not without a lecture. “Next time, take care of things professionally. Don’t be arrogant and never look down on people. Okay?”</p><p>The doctor nodded dramatically. “Yes sir, yes sir… Thank you so much. I am very grateful. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Charles left him and turned his face toward Norman. </p><p>Norman was almost freezing where he stood. Charles had demanded the doctor’s license, and now he knew what else he would ask.</p><p>“Okay, now give me your fingers,” Charles demanded.</p><p>Norman instantly stepped backward. He motioned to his guards to circle him, and they immediately did.</p><p>“What is happening here? Are you going to cut off my fingers — for an ordinary bet? We didn’t even mean it, it was just a bet. Who in their right mind would cut off someone’s fingers over a bet?” he ranted.</p><p>Charles scoffed. “But you wanted them to cut mine off some moment ago because you thought I failed. Now the table has turned — you’re paying for it.”</p><p>To everyone’s surprise, Mr. Vasilios stepped forward. “You even made me a witness to your bet, so you have to follow your own command. Your fingers will be cut off — and that is final.”</p><p>Norman was shocked. Mr. Vasilios motioned to the favoured men and they immediately surrounded him, closing in.</p><p>“Hey! you better know what you’re doing! Do you know my father? The owner of the consortium? He won’t forget any of you if you dare touch me. You better stay back right now.”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios snorted, annoyed. “You think your father will scare me? Even if your father came here, I’d have his fingers cut off too. You don’t know who I am. Your father can confirm that for you.”</p><p>With that it became clear: in the city’s hierarchy, Mr. Vasilios wasn’t a  businessman, he was a big investor who was connected to every powerful man, including Norman’s father. They all passed through him to become that big. It was like. Without him, Norman’s father wouldn’t be this great. </p><p>Norman realized it was over.</p><p>The guards moved without wasting time and seized him. Hands grabbed his arms hard. Two pulled while one shoved from behind. Norman’s feet scraped the floor. His knees left thin red streaks on the concrete.</p><p>“Stop—please—please!” he screamed, “please, Charles forgive me. I will do whatever you want, I am sorry, please, have mercy” He spat the words like a prayer.</p><p>A guard’s boot knocked his shin and forced his hand out, while another brought out a knife. This made him broke, and cried his eyes out.</p><p>“Please…. Charles. No, don’t let them do this, I am sorry for everything I ever did to you, I will be respecting you every time”</p><p>“Release him”, Charles chimed in and they did. Norman cries turned hiccups.</p><p>  “But I want him to go down on his knees and crawl from here to there five times,” Charles ordered. Pointing from the far opposite of the room to the end</p><p>“Fifty times? I will die!” Norman cried out.</p><p>Janet hauled him up close. “Shut the fuck up and be grateful that this isn’t worse. You better get down and do whatever he says.”</p><p>Norman’s eyes went cold and desperate. “If you try to act funny, it won’t end with your hand, I will plug out your eyes, so you better do what he asked you”</p><p>“Okay,” he whispered brokenly.</p><p>Norman dropped to his knees. He started crawling. The floor was rough, tearing his skin with each move.</p><p>“One… two…” he muttered, dragging himself forward. </p><p>“Three…four…”</p><p>By ten, his breath was shaking. By twenty, his knees were raw and burning. He cried, “Please… Charles… forgive me. I can’t take it anymore.”</p><p>Charles didn’t answer. He just watched, arms crossed. The guards stood close, monitoring him</p><p>Norman kept crawling. </p><p>“Thirty…” he gasped, his voice weak. Blood ran down his legs. He fell, pushed himself again.</p><p>At forty, he was sobbing. “Please… stop… I beg you, I can&#x27;t do this again, I will die.”</p><p>Charles said coldly, “Maybe losing your fingers will be better, right?”</p><p>Norman froze, shaking his head fast. “No! Please, Charles. I’ve learned my lesson. I’ll never do it again. Please let me go.”</p><p>Charles stared at him a moment, then said, “You have received your punishment well enough. You can leave.”</p><p>The guards stepped back. Norman struggled to his feet, legs trembling. His knees were bleeding badly. He limped toward the door, head down, not looking at anyone. He dragged his legs out. Regretting crossing with Charles.</p><p>After he had left, Mr. Vasilios faced Charles. “I don’t even know how to show my gratitude. I am very grateful. From today on, you have my respect. Please tell me whatever you want — I will do it.”</p><p>Charles smiled. “I’m pleased you saved your son and treated him, but I want you to know it wasn’t to get something. I saw the treatment and knew he needed it. Also, he will need to get treatment from me occasionally — for about three months  until he is stable.”</p><p>Mr. Norman was very happy. “Okay, pal. I understand. I understand.”</p><p>Kyle bowed. “Thanks, doctor. I am very grateful. Just tell us whatever you want and we will do it.”</p><p>Charles deliberately pushed his first request onto them. He said, “Well… I have something I feel you can do for me, and I will be very happy.” He began.</p><p>Mr. Vasilios asked, “Tell me. Tell me what that is. I will do it. Please.”</p><p>Charles gulped and said, “I want you to stop collecting area dues from Mr. Moretti,  forever — and let him transport his goods where he wants without you charging him.”</p></div>
