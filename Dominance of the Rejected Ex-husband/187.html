        <h1>Chapter 187</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a minute, the lobby shifted.</p><p>Boots scraped against marble. As the uniformed guards closed in from every direction. Batons hung heavy in their hands, black and unforgiving. In seconds, Charles and Serena were boxed in.</p><p>Jude spat on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even try to beg,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to break your legs no matter what you say.&rdquo;</p><p>Charles didn&rsquo;t flinch. He looked at the circle of guards and let out a short scoff.</p><p>&ldquo;Who told you we are going to apologize?&rdquo;</p><p>Jude&rsquo;s lips curled into a cruel smile. &ldquo;Good. Then this will be easy.&rdquo;</p><p>He lifted his hand and pointed sharply.</p><p>&ldquo;Security. Beat them. Cripple them.&rdquo;</p><p>The guards hesitated. No one moved.</p><p>A few exchanged uneasy glances. Batons tightened in their grips, but their feet stayed planted because this wasn&rsquo;t right. They knew it.&nbsp;</p><p>Jude noticed them.</p><p>His face twisted with rage. &ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo; he barked. &ldquo;Anyone who refuses will be sacked. Consider your job gone. Kiss it goodbye.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, the hesitation cracked. One guard took a step forward. Then another. The circle tightened.</p><p>Serena&rsquo;s nails dug into Charles&rsquo; sleeve. Her breath came fast now, shallow and sharp. &ldquo;Charles&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;This is bad.&rdquo;</p><p>Just as the first guard raised his baton&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</p><p>The shout cut through the lobby like a blade.</p><p>Everyone froze as heads turned toward the reception desk. It was the receptionist,&nbsp; who stood there, hands clenched at her sides.</p><p>&ldquo;Please stop.&rdquo;</p><p>Jude slowly turned.</p><p>His stare was deadly. &ldquo;What did you just shout at me, Quincy?&rdquo;</p><p>The room went silent.</p><p>Quincy, the receptionist swallowed hard. Her shoulders stiffened, then she lowered her head slightly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that, sir,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;All I&rsquo;m saying is&hellip; this isn&rsquo;t right. We shouldn&rsquo;t beat people. If there&rsquo;s an issue, we should detain them and call the police. That&rsquo;s the proper way.&rdquo;</p><p>Jude&rsquo;s jaw tightened. If the police were too involved, he would be the one to be blamed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Just shut up,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;You have no say in this. I&rsquo;m the COO. I can do whatever I want.&rdquo;</p><p>Quincy lifted her head again. Her hands were shaking now, but she didn&rsquo;t step back.</p><p>&ldquo;They came here with a proposal, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We should at least let them present it. What do you think the boss will do if she hears about this?&rdquo;</p><p>Jude&rsquo;s eyes flickered.</p><p>For a brief moment, doubt slipped through the cracks of his fury. The CEO&rsquo;s face flashed in his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Linda noticed immediately.</p><p>She shot Quincy a venomous glare. &ldquo;You are just a receptionist,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Know your place.&rdquo;</p><p>She whispered, &ldquo;will you let this dirty bitch talk down on you!&rdquo;.</p><p>Linda&rsquo;s words pushed Jude over the edge completely.</p><p>He spun toward the reception desk, his face dark with fury. &ldquo;Quincy &rdquo; he snapped, voice sharp and trembling, &ldquo;say one more word and I will sack you immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he turned back to the guards, spreading his arms in rage. &ldquo;What are you waiting for? Do your fucking job.&rdquo;</p><p>He sneered and added coldly, &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t fool yourselves. The CEO is on a two-week trip. I&rsquo;m the only one who can contact her directly. Everything I decide here is final and no one can change that.&rdquo;</p><p>He pointed straight at Charles. &ldquo;So beat him up like I ordered.&rdquo;</p><p>The guards had no choice now. They moved in.</p><p>Collins&rsquo; grin stretched wider as he watched, arms crossed, already savoring the outcome.</p><p>Just as one guard lifted his baton&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Step aside.&rdquo;</p><p>The voice rang through the lobby, firm and commanding, cutting straight through the tension.</p><p>Everyone froze.</p><p>Heads turned toward the entrance as the guards instinctively moved apart, a path opening without anyone quite realizing why.</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Sapphire has arrived!!!.&rdquo;</p><p>The words landed heavy in the air, and in that instant, the entire lobby went silent.</p><p>Jude froze.</p><p>The color drained from his face as the words sank in, his confidence collapsing in an instant. He had personally followed Sapphire to the airport yesterday.</p><p>He watched her board. That was the only reason he had acted so almighty today. She was supposed to be gone for two full weeks.</p><p>Why would she be back already?</p><p>He swallowed hard.</p><p>Then she came into view.</p><p>Sapphire stepped into the lobby dressed in a pristine white suit, tailored to perfection, elegant without effort.&nbsp;</p><p>Every line of her carried quiet authority, every step radiating power. Her beauty wasn&rsquo;t loud, but it was undeniable, refined, commanding.&nbsp;</p><p>This was the richest woman in the nation, the kind whose presence is overwhelming.</p><p>Behind her, a line of security men in black suits moved in formation, sharp-eyed and disciplined.</p><p>Jude reacted on instinct.</p><p>He bowed deeply, almost folding in half.</p><p>Around the lobby, employees snapped into motion. Heads lowered.&nbsp;</p><p>Even the guards surrounding Charles and Serena stiffened and stepped back.</p><p>Jude slowly raised his head, forcing a smile that barely held together.</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Sapphire,&rdquo; he said carefully. &ldquo;Why are you back so soon? You said two weeks. Did something happen.&rdquo;</p><p>Sapphire smiled faintly as she adjusted her cufflinks. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied calmly. &ldquo;Something came up and I had to take care of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Her gaze drifted across the lobby then, taking in the guards, the tense faces, Linda on the floor, the frozen expressions of Tracy and Collins.</p><p>Her eyes briefly passed over Charles.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t react like he recognized him.&nbsp;</p><p>Then she looked back at Jude.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here,&rdquo; she asked lightly. &ldquo;It seems my company is already on fire after just one day away.&rdquo;</p><p>Jude&rsquo;s throat tightened.</p><p>He swallowed again, his mind racing as lies began forming in his head.</p></div>
