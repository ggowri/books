        <h1>Chapter 144</h1>
        <div><p>“I will repeat it,” Tracy snarled, stepping forward. “You are a bitch.”</p><p>SMACK</p><p>She barely finished the word before Lizzypie’s palm cracked across her cheek. The sound punched through the air. Tracy staggered, knees wobbling, she nearly fell down. </p><p>Lizzypie didn’t even blink. “Keep running your mouth and I will rip your mouth this time .”</p><p>Tracy steadied herself, breathing hard, fury shaking through her.</p><p>“You bit…” She lunged, but Charles grabbed her waist and yanked her back.</p><p>“Hey—are you two seriously trying to fight in the middle of the road?” he snapped. “Everyone is watching!”</p><p>“I don’t fucking care!” Tracy screamed.</p><p>Lizzypie smirked, calm like she was watching a child throw a tantrum. Handling Tracy was the easiest thing on earth. If she wanted, she could snap Tracy’s bones in seconds. She didn’t even bother stepping back.</p><p>“I swear I will hit you back,” Tracy spat.</p><p>Charles frowned. “You already hit her. And you called her bitch.”</p><p>Tracy looked at him like he’d betrayed her soul. “Do you even listen at all? I just told you she nearly ruined me. Slapping her is the least thing I should have done!”</p><p>She tried to break free again, but Charles held her tighter.</p><p>“Stop.” His voice was low.</p><p>She froze, staring at him. “Charles… When did you become horrible? You’re defending someone who almost destroyed my life. Someone who almost turned me poor.”</p><p>Charles exhaled, long and heavy. His chest tightened with the urge to explain to tell her about the mission and that he was the secret investor who kept her company alive.</p><p>But he knew she wouldn’t understand.</p><p>Tracy saw his silence and snapped.</p><p>“You are horrible!” she screamed. “A poor, useless man who will do anything just to stay beside a rich woman!”</p><p>Her voice cracked. Rage swallowed her. She swung again toward Lizzypie, but Charles pulled her back harder this time.</p><p>“Tracy!” he shouted her name.</p><p>Tracy jerked wildly to break free. Her wrist slipped from his grip, her heel twisted, and she lost balance—falling straight to the ground with a thud.</p><p>Just then another voice cut through the chaos.</p><p>A man’s voice. </p><p>“How could you push a lady like that?”</p><p>They turned when they heard the voice.</p><p>Collins. Serena’s brother.</p><p>He was already striding toward them, jaw tight, eyes fixed on Charles.</p><p>“Charles,” Collins said sharply, “how could you handle a lady like that and just push her away? Do you want to injure her?”</p><p>Charles didn’t react. He just stared back at him, calm and unreadable.</p><p>Collins ignored him and bent down to help Tracy. He lifted her gently, steadying her by the elbow. “Are you okay, pretty?”</p><p>Tracy nodded slowly. “Yeah…”</p><p>Once she was standing, Collins straightened and faced Charles again.</p><p>“Apologize to her,” he ordered. “Right now.”</p><p>Charles scoffed under his breath. He didn’t even understand why Collins was here, or why he was yelling like he witnessed a murder. Still, he said nothing.</p><p>Collins stepped closer. “Why? You are not going to apologize? When you nearly injured her?”</p><p>Lizzypie spoke before Charles could. “I don’t see why any of this is your business.”</p><p>Collins snapped his head toward her. “Hey, whore. Stopping horrible people from injuring a beautiful lady is exactly my business.”</p><p>Tracy’s heart thumped hard when she heard that, he called her beautiful lady. She blinked, stunned.</p><p>Collins kept going, voice rising. “If you won’t apologize, I will call the police and have you both charged with assault.”</p><p>Charles frowned. “What will you even tell them? She slipped on her own.”</p><p>“You fucking liar!” Collins yelled. “I saw everything. I knew you were a liar the first day I laid eyes on you. Always hanging around with this bitch and still engaged to my sister. You piece of garbage.”</p><p>That was when Tracy finally understood who he was.</p><p>The only son of Mr. Moretti.</p><p>Her heartbeat kicked faster. Why would someone from that level take her side? What did that even mean? A thousand thoughts swarmed her at once.</p><p>Collins stepped forward, chest rising with anger. “I saw you mishandling a beautiful woman. I have every right to step in. Apologize, right now, or  I will take matters into my own hands before I even call the police.”</p><p>Charles scoffed again. “Look, I’m not apologizing. So stop sweating yourself.”</p><p>Collins didn’t move back. He squared his stance. He had trained in martial arts for years. Won first place in his school tournament. He was confident that he could take Charles on.</p><p>Charles couldn’t help the small laugh under his breath. “Drop it, Collins.”</p><p>He turned to Lizzypie instead. “Let’s just go.”</p><p>But Collins moved fast. He stepped in front of Charles, blocking him completely.</p><p>“You’re not leaving,” Collins said, chest puffed, voice firm. “Not until you apologize.”</p><p>Charles stared at him. Collins was being serious. But he was doing all these to impress Tracy. </p><p>From afar, the moment Collins set eyes on Tracy,  something hit him hard. Tracy’s beauty shone in his eyes like a spotlight. The short skirt showing her legs, the curve of her hips… her perfect round boobs… he fell in love instantly. He wanted her attention.</p><p>And this was the perfect chance to impress her. He would go as far as he needed to win her admiration.</p><p>And it was already working.</p><p>Tracy looked at him with a mix of surprise and subtle admiration. </p><p>She stepped forward, her voice suddenly softer. “Charles is not that hard. You and your… lady here should just apologize, and everything will be okay and end fine.”</p></div>
