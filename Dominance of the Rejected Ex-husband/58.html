        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div><p>Charles summoned his courage and stepped into the store.</p><p> The moment he entered, a rush of brilliance swallowed him whole. The interior shimmered under soft golden lights that bounced off every surface. Rows of glass showcases stretched before him, displaying sapphires, emeralds, rubies, topaz, and diamonds.</p><p>Charles took a slow step forward, glancing at each one of them.</p><p>“Hey! Please, leave me alone. I’m sick and tired of you disturbing me!” a woman shouted from near the counter.</p><p>A man’s voice followed. “Why are you acting stubborn? I told you, I will spend like mad on you. I will take this store to the next level! You need someone like me in your life.”</p><p>“I don’t,” the lady shot back. “I want peace in my life. Please, just leave me alone. You’re disturbing me.”</p><p>“Hey, stop doing this to me,” the man said, his tone darkening. “I want you… and that beautiful body of yours. Let me have it.” He stepped closer and reached for her arm.</p><p>Before he could touch her, Charles moved without thinking. It was clear the man was harassing her. His hand shot out, gripping the man’s wrist tightly.</p><p>“Hey, you should stop already,” he said firmly.</p><p>The man turned, face twisting in surprise.</p><p>It was Derek.</p><p>Derek was just as stunned to see that it was Charles who had stopped him. He felt exposed, caught in the act of flirting with another woman.</p><p>Charles looked at him with disgust. When it came to despicable human beings, Derek topped the list. Moments ago, this same man had been sleeping with Tracy’s mother in a filthy BDSM affair, and now he was here, forcing himself on another woman who clearly wasn’t interested.</p><p>Charles couldn’t understand how Tracy had ever met someone like him, let alone allowed him to wreck their marriage.</p><p>Derek yanked his arm free. “Get your dirty hand off me!” he barked.</p><p>Charles released him and said coldly, “You’re an outright jerk. You should know when to back down. She said she isn’t interested. Accept defeat, you loser.”</p><p>Derek’s jaw tightened. He didn’t want Tracy to ever hear about this, so he quickly lied. “What the hell are you talking about? I was just discussing business with her, not what you are thinking.”</p><p>The lady immediately spoke up, her voice sharp and angry. “Hell no! You were harassing me. You even tried to touch me!”</p><p>Charles turned toward her and for a moment, he was caught off guard. The woman was strikingly beautiful, clearly of mixed American and Asian descent. Her face was delicately round with large eyes. She had a graceful figure with soft curves and perfect, balanced proportions. She wasn’t as voluptuous as Lizzy, but she was captivating in her own way.</p><p>He suddenly understood what had made Derek lose control, but attraction never justified disrespect. When a woman said no, it meant no.</p><p>Charles turned back to Derek. “You shouldn’t even bother lying, you disgusting womanizer.”</p><p>Derek’s face flushed red with anger. “What the hell are you doing here? Do you even know where you just walked into? Are you lost?”</p><p>Charles glared at him. “It’s none of your business.”</p><p>Derek scoffed. “Obviously, you are clueless. This place isn’t for someone like you.”</p><p>Before Charles could respond, the lady stepped between them, straightening her posture. Her tone shifted to calm professionalism.</p><p>“Welcome to The Light Store. I’m Natasha, the owner. Please, how can I help you?”</p><p>Charles blinked in surprise. The woman Derek had just been harassing was the owner of the entire store.</p><p>Damn, that was something. That meant she was worth millions, in fact, hundreds of millions even. This business wasn’t child’s play. Natasha wasn’t just beautiful; she was powerful and rich. No wonder Derek had been drooling over her.</p><p>“Oh, you are the owner here,” Charles said. “I would like to do stone trading.”</p><p>Even though he had no money, he said it with quiet confidence.</p><p>Derek let out a mocking laugh. “You? Doing stone trading?” He folded his arms, still smirking. “You think this is some kind of game? What do you even know about stones?”</p><p>Charles’s jaw tightened. “It’s none of your business, Derek.”</p><p>Derek sneered. “You’ve been fooling around with Ms. Serena, haven’t you? Using her money for your little games. And now you want to gamble it away?” He chuckled darkly. “You will lose every damn cent.”</p><p>Before Charles could respond, Natasha spoke, her voice calm but firm. “Enough.” She turned to Charles, her eyes softening. “Have you ever done a blind stone cut before?”</p><p>Charles hesitated. “No.”</p><p>“Then I’d advise you not to,” she said. “Normally, I don’t care if people who know nothing about these stones want to throw their money away—but you seem decent. You helped me deal with this filthy man,” she added, casting a glare at Derek. “So take my advice. Don’t get into it.”</p><p>Charles gave a faint smile. He appreciated the warning, but a quiet confidence stirred inside him.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” he said calmly. “I know what I’m doing.”</p><p>Just as he finished, a gruff voice bellowed from behind him.</p><p> “Do you really know what you’re doing, dumb man?!”</p><p>They all turned. It was Norman, flanked by three hard-looking men.</p><p>In his presence, everyone in the store froze. The air thickened with tension. Norman, </p><p>heir of the Consortium Enterprises.</p><p>Even Natasha hurried forward, her tone instantly shifting. “Oh, Mr. Norman, welcome. I wasn’t expecting you today,” she said, practically groveling.</p><p>The Consortium was the company that supplied stones to Natasha’s business in wholesales and absolutely raw. She was the one that handled the main cuts and resales.</p><p> Since they were her primary dealers, she would never want to offend them, especially Norman.</p><p>At that moment, Norman placed his hand on her ass. She didn’t like it, but she couldn’t say anything.</p><p>“What the heck is this useless and poor man doing in your store!”.  He was referring to Charles.</p><p>Instantly ,  it was obvious to everyone that there was bad blood between the two of them. Derek smirked. </p><p></p></div>
