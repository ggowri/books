        <h1>Chapter 150</h1>
        <div>Sapphire exhaled and said she was already planning to leave the city. She had been looking for somewhere else to continue her work.<br/> It hurt her that she wouldn’t be able to leave her legacy in the city where she was born, schooled and invested so much of herself. Starting from scratch again felt like a punishment. <br/>Charles shook his head. “No. You will do whatever you want here. It’s insane that you have to run because of him.”<br/>Sapphire scoffed. “So I should keep fighting him? When I can’t win? Uhn?”<br/>Charles leaned forward. “Don’t worry. I will take care of him. You will do whatever you want when I'm finished with him”<br/>They all burst into loud laughter. They thought he was bluffing or trying to sound heroic. Tina even joked that he watched too many action movies.<br/>After that they drifted into lighter conversations. The girls started teasing Sapphire about how she was basically a nun. No man in her life. No dating or any romance. .<br/>Sapphire rolled her eyes. “I only focus on my career. Men or any love life are distractions.”<br/>Tina nudged Amara and whispered loud enough for everyone to hear. “So she is a virgin at forty-three.”<br/>“What? That isn’t true,” Charles was amazed hearing this. His eyes widened. How could a forty-three-year-old woman still be a virgin?<br/>Sapphire scoffed. “Yeah yeah, it is true. Think whatever you want. I just don’t fancy sex.”<br/>Charles added, “That's because you never have it!”.<br/>She nodded in understanding, “Maybe that, I will try it one day”.<br/>It surprised Charles how easily they all talked about uncomfortable things even though they had just met. <br/>The room was filled with soft chatter, small jokes.<br/>It was already late in the night before Charles realized how late it was…<br/>Charles stretched his neck a little and said, “I think it’s about time I leave.”<br/>The girls paused. Amara frowned. “Wait… Uncle Charles, where did you live?”<br/>“Ravenport City,” Charles replied casually.<br/>Tina’s eyes widened. “Ravenport? That’s not even near here. That’s a three-hour ride.”<br/>Amara added, “And it’s already late. You will reach home around midnight.”<br/>Charles waved his hand. “It’s fine. I will manage. It actually nothing”<br/>Tina shook her head. “No.  Why don't you sleep over and go tomorrow.”<br/>Amara brightened up. “Yes! Stay with us tonight!” She looked at Sapphire. “Auntie, right?”<br/>Sapphire nodded gently. “You can stay, Charles. It’s safer. They are numbers of crime in Winchester”<br/>Charles looked around the room. Barely enough space for three people, let alone four. He didn’t want to be a burden.<br/>He sighed. “It’s okay. I will  get home safely.”<br/>Amara’s face instantly twisted. “Uncle Charles doesn’t want to stay because our room is small and not pretty.”<br/>Tina nodded with a pout. “Yeah. Uncle Charles is making me feel bad.”<br/>They both stared at him with matching whiny faces.  They had grown attached to him and didn't want to let him leave. They put on a cute baby's face. <br/>Charles lifted his hands in defeat. “Alright… alright. I will stay.”<br/>The girls cheered quietly. Sapphire stood and said, “Let me arrange the space so you can sleep somewhere comfortable.”<br/>She turned and walked to the small side room. Charles watched her move, her soft steps, and how her ass danced behind her. <br/>He still couldn’t understand how a woman like her ended up living this way.<br/>Amara leaned close to Charles and whispered loudly, “Uncle Charles… you will eat her up with your eyes at this rate.”<br/>Charles jolted. “What? What are you talking about?”<br/>Tina giggled. “Do you love my aunt?” Her eyes were bright with excitement. “Why don’t you woo her? I can help you!”<br/>Amara clapped her hands. “Yes yes! Please marry my aunt. You’re a nice man. Very handsome too.”<br/>Charles scoffed hard. “Get away with your weird ideas. What’s wrong with both of you?”<br/>The girls kept grinning. Tina nudged him. “So you don’t like her?”<br/>Charles scoffed again and didn't reply, he thought to herself ‘She’s  so damn beautiful , but she is over ten years older than me. And I have enough women troubling my life already’.<br/>Then, sapphire returned with a mattress and created a space for him. They had a lot of conversation before everyone drifted to sleep. Squeezing each other.<br/>×××<br/>The next morning, Charles was awakened by a tap. <br/>“Uncle Charles… uncle Charles”,  He groaned as he opened his eyes. The morning sun was shining in. <br/>He sat up straight and Tina who woke him immediately added. Her voice shook with panic, “You have to see this”.<br/>Charles rubbed his eyes. “What is it? What happened?”<br/>Tina didn’t answer. She hurried back to where Sapphire and Amara were standing. Both were glued to Sapphire’s phone, their faces stiff with shock. Charles slowly got up and walked toward them.<br/>“What’s going on?” he asked.<br/>Sapphire didn’t speak. She simply turned the screen toward him.<br/>Charles’ jaw tightened.<br/>It was the video from yesterday—the one Damien’s son recorded when he asked Charles to kneel.<br/>But this time, it was edited and twisted.<br/>A voiceover played. It was Paul’s voice, smug and calm.<br/>“This poor elderly shameless man ambushed me and my friend yesterday and asked us for money. He’s older and we’re kids, but he kept threatening us when we refused. I told him to kneel and ask properly. Such a shame. He said he didn’t have a single coin on him.”<br/>Then the actual clip played, where Charles was on his knees.<br/>Below the video, the numbers glared at him:<br/>Likes: 3 million<br/>Views: 100 million<br/>Shares: 5 million<br/>Which means the video has gone viral, It has exploded far beyond Winchester.</div>
