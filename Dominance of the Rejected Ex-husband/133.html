        <h1>Chapter 133</h1>
        <div>Charles made his way to the Pentemoon Hotel, his mind running in circles.<br/>How did Mr. Eden know anything about his father? Why call him this late?<br/>None of it felt right.<br/>He walked through the hotel lobby, silent, straight to the elevator, straight to Room 904.<br/>The hallway was quiet. <br/>He arrived at the door and knocked once. But there was no reply.<br/>He knocked again.<br/>Still nothing.<br/>Charles frowned, twisted the handle, and pushed the door open. It wasn't locked.<br/>The room was pitch dark.<br/>He stepped inside slowly.<br/>His foot bumped into something on the floor — a chair, maybe. He reached forward but grazed something sharp.<br/>“Ah—” he hissed as a knife edge grazed his hand, leaving a sting. He pulled his hand back, and the knife slipped into his palm by reflex.<br/>He searched the wall and felt a socket, he clicked the light switch.<br/>The room flashed into view. He frowned at what he saw. Blood. Everywhere.<br/>Across the carpet. On the walls and on the sheets.<br/>And on the cold floor, Mr. Eden lay motionless, his eyes open, hole in his throat.<br/>Charles whispered, “What the… hell…”<br/>The knife he picked up by accident was still in his hand.<br/>Before he could move—<br/>THUD!!!<br/>The door burst open.<br/>Police officers stormed inside, guns already raised.<br/>“DROP THE WEAPON! NOW!”<br/>“Hands where we can see them!”<br/>“Don’t move!”<br/>Charles blinked at them, stunned.<br/>He slowly lowered the knife and let it fall to the floor. His hands rose into the air.<br/>The officers rushed him, yanked his arms behind his back, and slapped cold handcuffs onto his wrists.<br/>“You are under arrest for the murder of Mr. Eden,” one officer said. “You have the right to remain silent…”<br/>Charles stared at the bloody room, at Mr. Eden’s lifeless body, at the officers dragging him away.<br/>At that moment,  he knew he had been framed. Perfectly. <br/>×××××<br/>[The next morning].<br/>In the Moretti mansion, the entire family was gathered in the living room.<br/>The TV blared with breaking news. A reporter stood in front of the Pentemoon Hotel speaking fast about the murder. The family had been watching it.<br/>“…and according to eyewitnesses, the culprit responsible for the brutal death of Mr. Eden of Titan Corporation is confirmed to be Mr. Charles, the fiancé of Ms. Serena Moretti…”<br/>Gasps filled the room.<br/>“…police arrived at the scene and found Mr. Charles holding the murder weapon. He was arrested immediately on the scene…”<br/>Mr. Moretti angrily switched off the TV, his jaw clenched hard.<br/>Collins shot to his feet. “Fuck, I knew something like this would happen. I knew that bastard would drag this family into trouble. He’s cursed. He’s poisonous. I told you all!”<br/>Allison scoffed. “He killed someone. Mr. Eden of all people. He didn’t even fear his power and he killed him. He just dragged a death sentence straight into this house.”<br/>Fiona, one of the cousins, folded her arms. “This makes me doubt Mr. Haron’s death honestly. I heard Charles was there that day too. What if Haron didn’t do what Serena accused him of and Charles just… killed him.”<br/>Serena snapped instantly. “Shut the fuck up. I recorded everything, I played it for all of you. He tried to kill me. Charles saved me. Charles didn’t kill him. He killed himself!”<br/>Collins scoffed loud. “Who knows if you and Charles forced Mr. Haron to make a false confession. How do we know you didn’t team up with him?”<br/>Allison added, “Father, Serena is dangerous. She shouldn’t even be in this family. Everywhere she goes, chaos happens.”<br/>Mr. Moretti rubbed his forehead, exhausted.<br/>Serena’s voice cracked. “What are you all saying… Why would Charles want Haron dead and just kill him? Use your brain”<br/>Collins fired back, “Maybe you should ask Mr. Eden’s corpse. That man Charles is a psychopath, he kills whoever he wants and you are still defending him.”<br/>Mr. Moretti finally spoke, slow and heavy. “Serena. How much do you really know this man?”<br/>Serena opened her mouth, then closed it again, trying to breathe.<br/>She hadn’t known Charles for long… but she knew  his character. He wasn’t someone who killed for fun or without reason.<br/>She looked up. “Sir… I know he’s not a cold-blooded killer. He has saved me many times”.<br/>Collins muttered, “They’re calling him the culprit, not the suspect. He was caught red-handed with the knife in his hand”<br/>Serena lifted her chin stubbornly. “If he really did it… then he must have had a reason.”<br/>Collins scoffed loudly. “So you are giving killing someone… a reason?”<br/>Serena stared him down. “Yeah. I am.” Her voice was firm, bold.<br/>Collins threw his hands up. “Serena is crazy.”<br/>Mr. Moretti exhaled sharply. “This will create a huge stain on our reputation and company. We will be dragged into the mud with him. Serena, I want you to publicly break up with him and make it clear you are not on his side.”<br/>Serena scoffed. “So you want me to just throw him under the bus without any clear investigation?”<br/>Allison snapped. “What investigation? He was caught red-handed with the knife. What more do you want?”<br/>Serena shook her head. “I want to meet him. I want to hear what he has to say.”<br/>Collins laughed darkly. “What does a killer have to say? What wisdom do you expect to hear from a man who stabbed Mr. Eden?”<br/>Serena ignored him and faced her father. “Please. Just give me today. Let me see him.”<br/>Fiona clicked her tongue. “You know meeting him alone can ruin your public image. Why are you being so reckless over a man?”<br/>Mr. Moretti looked at his daughter. He knew Serena. He knew that once she decided something, fire wouldn’t stop her, not even family. He sighed heavily.<br/>“You can meet him,” he said. “But be discreet. Very discreet. Go late at night.”<br/>Serena bowed her head. “Thank you, father.”<br/>Collins groaned. “You always give her chances. But not me. No matter what she does or how much damage she causes, you always have her back. Your favoritism is the reason Haron wanted to kill her… and honestly, I’m feeling like that too.”<br/>Everyone gasped.<br/>“What!” Serena shouted.<br/>Allison covered her mouth.<br/>Mr. Moretti’s expression turned cold and shocked.<br/>Collins didn’t back down. “Yes. That’s how I feel.”<br/>Then he stormed out of the room.</div>
