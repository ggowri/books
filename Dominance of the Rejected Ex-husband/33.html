        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div>Charles wondered how his grandfather always found new ways to surprise him. First, he was discovered, and instead of being given all his grandfather’s wealth, he was expected to complete a trial entirely on his own.<br/>He had been given a mission to get engaged to a powerful woman. Now, his grandfather had sent him another woman as a reward.<br/>The busty lady just stood there with a smile, and Charles couldn’t stop staring at her.<br/>“Yeah, I'm your reward. And stop standing there…hop in!” she shrieked, opening the car door and stepping inside.<br/>She started the car and vroomed away. Charles had no idea where they were headed.<br/>He had many questions, and one finally escaped his lips. “So…what’s your name, and who are you?”<br/>She faced him and smiled. “I'm Lizzypie… and I'm your reward. You can do whatever you want with me!”<br/>Charles stared at her, noting how her eyes remained glued to the road. Whatever he wanted to do… What else could he do with a woman like her? He still wondered why Mr. Vincent would send a lady as his reward.<br/>Then it struck him!.<br/>He had managed to open the Eye of Satan, level one, with Tracy’s first encounter. But it had always been like that for five years. After that first moment, he had never experienced another passionate encounter. All they had were Tracy’s instructions on what to do to him.<br/>What if what he needed now was a fresh, passionate experience? Maybe that was why his grandfather had sent her.<br/>He stared at her, forming images in his mind. Then Lizzypie turned to him. “Why are you looking at me like that? Are you disappointed Mr. Vincent sent me instead of money? You seem to think I’m not worthy of your reward.”<br/>“No… I was just…” Charles began.<br/>She cut him off. “Your reaction all this time says it. You know I’m not just going to give myself to you. You have to earn it. Huh?”<br/>Charles frowned, confused.<br/>“You have to earn it and show that you’re really worth being my master. Then I’ll do whatever you want,” she continued.<br/>Charles sighed and nodded.<br/>“By the way,” Lizzypie said, “your grandfather also told me to deliver your second mission.”<br/>Charles was wary. “What is it?”<br/>She said, “He asked you to take everything your ex-wife has and bring her back to zero.”<br/>Charles’ eyes widened. “What?! That’s awful.”<br/>Even though he had helped Tracy climb the ladder and built her company up with his guidance, only to be betrayed later. He had never thought of taking revenge like this.<br/>“That’s crazy. You know how many years it took her to build all that she has. And he wants me to destroy it?”<br/>Lizzypie scoffed. “Your grandfather was right all along…you are such a weak ass. Mr. Vincent knows everything about you, and what your ex-wife did. He wants you to teach her a lesson and make her regret it… but you can’t. Bet you still have feelings for her.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “I have no feelings. I just see it as inhumane. No matter what she did, I shouldn’t take revenge. Then I would be no better than her if I did.”<br/>Lizzypie rolled her eyes. “Well, it seems you wouldn’t be able to claim Mr. Vincent’s wealth after all!”<br/>Speaking of Tracy, Charles’ phone rang. When he checked, it was her. He frowned, wondering why she was calling.<br/>He had made up his mind not to speak to her again and had even blocked her number…though he forgot to do it earlier.<br/>He decided to pick up just this once. As soon as he hit the green button, Tracy’s voice shrieked from the phone.<br/>“What the heck, Charles! Are you for real? It’s not even been a week since our divorce, and you’re already engaged to another woman?”<br/>She must have seen pictures of him with Serena.<br/>Charles sighed. “We divorced officially and properly. What I do later is none of your business.”<br/>“Whoa, is that really it? I bet you were cheating on me even during our marriage! That’s why you kept pushing me away! You wanted the divorce and made it my fault so you could be with that bitch!” she yelled.<br/>Charles sighed again. Tracy obviously didn’t even know her new lover was sleeping with her mother, yet she still had energy to yell at him.<br/>“If that’s all you have to say, I’ll hang up,” he said.<br/>“I hate you, Charles! I hate you! And I’m sure you want to be with Serena because of her high status. You parasite, lowlife man! You can never do things on your own! Always looking for someone to leech off!”<br/>It was obvious Tracy was in pain over Charles getting engaged to Serena. He scoffed, why would she care, when they were divorced?<br/>Then the phone beeped again. It was a message from  Tracy.<br/>“Call off the engagement! Let’s meet…we have things to sort out!”.</div>
