        <h1>Chapter 123</h1>
        <div>After two days, Tracy’s company bounced back. Not fully, but enough to stand. Because of that mysterious 100-million investment, the stock rose a little and, seeing the sudden recovery, some investors and shareholders gambled on it and started rushing in again.<br/>With the money she had now, Tracy set up her company back. Not as big as before, but it was running again. Functioning again. Alive again.<br/>All the while, she was still investigating who that mysterious man was.<br/>She vowed that whenever she saw him, she would become his slave, she would drop to her knees as his dog if he asked — that was how grateful she was. But she didn’t know who the person was.<br/>Meanwhile, in Dynamite Bank…<br/>Charles and Lizzypie were walking out. They were premium customers in the bank, and they had just met with the manager to collect the Golden Black Card.<br/>The manager already knew Charles’s real identity, so he treated him with full respect.<br/>Just as they reached the exit and were about to walk away, a sharp tiny voice came from behind:<br/>“Wait! Isn’t that the bastard!?”<br/>Charles and Lizzypie turned.<br/>A teenage girl stood there, pointing at Charles with fire in her eyes. Charles immediately recognized her.<br/>Elena. Tracy’s little sister.<br/>She had been studying outside the country, and she just finished her studies and returned to town. Elena was always a little brat, and Charles knew that very well.<br/>Beside Elena stood Mrs. Hailey.<br/>Charles muttered, “Elena.”<br/>She shrieked instantly. “Hey! Just stop! Don’t you dare speak my name again! After everything my sister did for you, you still went ahead to cheat and divorce her because of one small misunderstanding?!”<br/>Charles looked at her. She was just nineteen, still a kid, and he didn’t take her words to heart. Just saw her as someone loud and stupid.<br/>He turned away and told Lizzypie, “Let’s go.”<br/>But Elena stepped forward sharply.<br/>“Ohhh, the truth hurts, ehn?! You don’t want to hear it? You displayed my mom’s sex tape all over the whole city to see and used it to destroy my sister’s career!”.<br/>Charles exhaled sharply. “Maybe you should ask your mom what they were planning before the sex tape got aired.”<br/>Elena snapped. “Shut up! Stop finding excuses, you ungrateful man!”<br/>Lizzypie stepped forward, her eyes cold.<br/>“I think stupidity runs in your family. Your mom’s sex tape got aired.  The one she made with your sister’s lover  and the person you’re angry at is Charles? Really?”<br/>“Shut up, you bitch!” Elena fired back instantly. “I have heard a lot about you. How you always drag him around. Heard he’s surviving on you now, he is your little toy, why wouldn't you back him up”.<br/>She continued “So what if my mother had sex with Derek or whatever? That is her personal life. And I later heard Derek wasn’t in ANY relationship with my sister. So why can’t he and my mom fuck?”<br/>Charles squeezed his face at her level of idiotic thinking. “You are even worse than your sister,” he muttered.<br/>Mrs. Hailey, who had been silent, finally found her voice. “Well… she’s telling the truth,” she said weakly. “What me and Derek had… it isn’t any issue or new thing. We just happened to attract each other sexually.”<br/>Charles looked at her sharply and shook his head.<br/>“Fuck… you have no shame. You shouldn’t even talk. Your whole mouth is leaking just like your asshole.”<br/>“YOU BASTARD!! Don’t you dare insult my mother!” Elena screamed.<br/>Lizzypie stepped closer with a smirk.<br/>“Should you even feel insulted? You don’t mind your mom fucking your sister’s lover. So what’s left to protect?”<br/>Elena’s face turned red with anger.<br/>“Anyway, people have already forgotten about it! And guess what…. My sister has bounced back! She’s doing well now! So whatever you planned FAILED!”<br/>Charles stared at her blankly.<br/>“Are you sure you even went to school? You talk like an illiterate junkie street kid.”<br/>That hit Elena hard. She shrieked in rage and lunged at Charles, trying to scratch his face.<br/>But before she could reach him —Lizzypie grabbed her wrist mid-air, twisted slightly, and shoved her back.<br/>Elena was lighter than what Lizzypie could imagine. She flew backward and crashed onto the glossy bank floor so hard.<br/>Her arm slammed the floor with a painful crack.<br/>“Aaaah!!” she cried out as blood started dripping from her elbow.<br/>Mrs. Hailey instantly screamed, “ELENA!!”<br/>She rushed to her daughter immediately. Blood was coming out nonstop from Elena’s arm. She turned and glared at Charles fiercely.<br/>“You want to kill my daughter!?” she screamed.<br/>Charles looked a little concerned but didn’t step forward.<br/>Just then a voice came sharply<br/>“Mom!? Elena!?”<br/>Everyone turned. It was Tracy, rushing  toward them and bent down beside her sister, eyes wide when she saw the wound.<br/>“What happened to you?” she asked.<br/>Elena pointed her shaky finger straight at Charles and Lizzypie.<br/>“It was those two people… they stopped us and started abusing us because of mom’s sex tape. They were shaming her a lot and even called her a bitch. I tried to stop them. Only for that lady to push me away!”<br/>She lied through her teeth.<br/>Mrs. Hailey nodded repeatedly.<br/>“Yes, yes… Charles was mocking me because of my shameful past. They pushed her!”<br/>Tracy gulped, anger forming, then she slowly stood and faced Charles.<br/>“Charles… I know what my mom did is a shameful and crazy act. But you should let it go already. You… already got what you wanted from it. My life was ruined because of it. That should be enough. Why are you still doing this?”<br/>Charles frowned.<br/>“Elena is lying. She was the first to come at me. She even tried to attack me before Lizzypie stopped her.”<br/>Elena cried harder.<br/>“They are lying! Lying! They are angry that you bounced back and took it out on me!”<br/>Tracy said strongly, “Charles, I can never tolerate this. Look at my sister’s hand bleeding. Don’t lie. I understand your rage and I will even forgive you. But hurting my family is too far.”<br/>Charles scoffed.<br/>“I’m not lying. Your sister is.”<br/>Tracy snapped back instantly.<br/>“My sister can’t lie.”<br/>Charles stared at her and said calmly<br/>“But I can?”</div>
