        <h1>Chapter 177</h1>
        <div><p>Hearing this, Mr. Damien went devastated and couldn’t believe what was happening. He had used his entire life to build this wealth, yet in the space of an hour, everything vanished.</p><p>He gazed at Charles and walked closer to him. “What did you do? Who the hell are you? And how were you able to kill Razor?”</p><p>Charles smirked and replied calmly, “You ask too many questions.”</p><p>Mr. Damien scoffed. “Let me tell you this is only temporary, because I work with the police and every agency in Winchester. They will release my company and my wealth, and when that happens, consider yourself finished.”</p><p>“I told you,” Charles said evenly. “This time, it’s different.”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted from within the crowd. “Hey! Everyone, you have to see this! Mr. Damien’s company, Cheng Enterprises, has just been declared bankrupt!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Unbelievable!”</p><p>Everyone immediately checked their phones to confirm the news, and they saw it for themselves.</p><p>Even Mr. Moretti and the others were shocked by what they found. Serena was deeply confused. Charles had confidently said Mr. Damien would lose everything, and now he truly had.</p><p>As she wondered how this was possible, the rest of the crowd did the same.</p><p>Another person spoke up. “Wait. Mr. Charles said Mr. Damien would lose everything, and he did. Did he cause this?”</p><p>“If he can do something like this, then how powerful is Mr. Charles?”</p><p>Speculation spread through the hall as murmurs grew louder. Mr. Damien suddenly yelled in anger.</p><p>“You’re all fools! This is just a mistake by the officials. They will return my company to me. I am Damien of Winchester. I own everyone here!”</p><p>He was still bragging.</p><p>Charles stared at him and scoffed.</p><p>At that exact moment, the doors of the hall flung open.</p><p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p><p>The floor trembled as police officers marched in with heavy boots. Four of them, dressed in SWAT uniforms, weapons in hand.</p><p>The crowd immediately parted as their leader, a man wearing a red cap, stepped forward and approached Mr. Damien, who stood frozen in shock.</p><p>The leader announced, “Mr. Damien, you are under arrest on charges of tax evasion, illegal property acquisition, abetting murder, human trafficking, drug trafficking, and ten other related charges.”</p><p>Gasps filled the room as the list went on. The hall erupted into murmurs.</p><p>“Did Mr. Damien really do all that?”</p><p>“Human trafficking?”</p><p>“I always knew he was a bad person.”</p><p>Mr. Damien trembled, his face flushing red as rage boiled over. “You don’t have the power to arrest me!” he shouted. “One call to your commander-in-charge and every single one of you will be sacked!”</p><p>Before anyone could respond, a commanding voice echoed through the hall.</p><p>“All hail Commander Jay. Salute.”</p><p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p><p>Three more officers entered, but this time they were led by a man in military uniform. His presence alone silenced the room. It was Commander Jay, the commander-in-charge.</p><p>Mr. Damien’s expression shifted. A confident smile crept onto his face as he rushed forward. “Jay, thank God you came in time. Your men are harassing me. Sack every one of them!!!”</p><p>He stood close, certain the commander would take his side since they were close friends. </p><p>Commander Jay stared at him coldly. “You’re despicable.”</p><p>Mr. Damien froze.</p><p>“You sold girls for sexual activities. You funded illegal activities. You destroyed lives,” Jay continued. “You will rot in prison.”</p><p>He turned sharply. “Arrest him. Now!!!.  Shoot anyone who tries to stop you.”</p><p>Instantly, Mr. Damien’s bodyguards stepped back.</p><p>“No… wait—” Mr. Damien struggled as officers grabbed him and dragged him away. “Jay! Jay! No!”</p><p>His voice cracked as panic took over. “After everything I’ve done for you, you will regret this!... I&#x27;m  Damien!. I will come back”</p><p>His screams echoed through the hall as he was pulled out, everyone  the despicable moment.</p><p>As Mr. Damien was dragged out, his screams fading down the corridor, silence settled over the hall.</p><p>Commander Jay turned back. Then, unexpectedly, he bowed in front of Charles and said.</p><p>“Sir.”</p><p>The word cut through the room. Everyone froze. The commander in chief of the nation just bowed and called Charles sir!!!.</p><p>“Sir?” someone whispered.</p><p>Murmurs erupted instantly.</p><p>“He called him sir?”</p><p>“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”</p><p>Serena’s eyes widened. She stepped forward, confused. “Sorry,” she said carefully. “You just called him sir. Who exactly is he to you?”</p><p>All eyes shifted to Charles.</p><p>The air grew tense. People stared harder now, reassessing him. The calm and  confidence. The certainty with which he had spoken earlier. Was he someone powerful?</p><p>Commander Jay stiffened. Actually,  he was called and informed by the state secretary about Charles and that he was the Godfather&#x27;s grandson.  </p><p>And everyone knew that after the president,  was the godfather. In fact, rumours had it that the godfather was more powerful and controlled the president. </p><p>But, he was told to keep his secret, and just do whatever Charles instructed him. But he just slipped. </p><p>He cleared his throat, visibly flustered. “Uh… actually,” he said, forcing a smile. “Mr. Charles here is a hero.”</p><p>The crowd leaned in. </p><p>“He was the one who uncovered Mr. Damien’s illegal operations,” Jay continued. “His warehouses where he stored all his illegal properties.” He paused,</p><p>“Because of him, we rescued over three hundred little girls today, just moments before they were trafficked.”</p><p>Gasps rippled through the hall.</p><p>“Oh… that an hero act indeed”</p><p>“That’s unbelievable.”</p><p>“So that’s why he knew Damien would fall.”</p><p>Serena slowly nodded as well. It was the only explanation that made sense.</p><p>Commander Jay straightened. “You should all respect him. He did what I could not.” He turned to Charles and bowed again. “My respect.”</p><p>Without another word, he turned and walked out with his men.</p><p>The doors closed behind them.</p><p>Everyone stared at Charles now. With respect. They all just stayed mute, staring at him. </p><p>Then, a voice shouted from the back of the hall.</p><p>“Hey! You all need to see this!”, as the person raised up his phone. </p><p></p></div>
