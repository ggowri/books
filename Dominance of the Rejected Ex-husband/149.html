        <h1>Chapter 149</h1>
        <div>They maneuvered him in. He gently walked into the tight, dull room and wondered how three people would fit in this place.<br/>There was also a tiny room at the side of the house with blinking lights coming from it. Charles was curious and kept glancing at the room.<br/>“Oh, that is my workspace. I’m an engineer and a programmer,” the beautiful lady—who was apparently the girl’s aunt—said.<br/>“Ohhh…” Charles replied, forcing a smile.<br/>“Please… let me quickly cook. Wait for dinner as appreciation,” the aunt said. Charles didn’t want to stress them and wanted to say no.<br/>But since the girls had said earlier that he was running away from their shabby house, he decided to stay. He put on a smile and nodded.<br/>The aunt turned into the kitchen, which was just another little space in the room. Charles’s eyes stayed on her. Even though this lady was about ten years older than him, she looked so pretty.<br/>“She is very beautiful, right?” one of the girls said, snapping Charles out of his thoughts.<br/>“Uh… no… no… actually,” he stammered.<br/>The other girl said, “You don’t have to explain or act shy. There is no man who looks at Aunt Sapphire once and doesn’t stare again. She is undeniably pretty. She has men lining up for her. I understand if your eyes can’t get away from her.”<br/>Charles felt embarrassed, but it was true. Sapphire was truly endowed.<br/>The girl with asthma said, “I don’t understand why she never dates any of those rich men. Such a waste.”<br/>Charles scoffed awkwardly, and to shift away from the topic he asked for their names. The one with asthma was Tina, while her friend was Amara.<br/>Although Charles didn’t ask much, they told him about their lives. Tina’s parents died when she was a kid, and her aunt had been taking care of her. Amara was a friend she met at school. She was from an orphanage house, and after she was sent away with nowhere to go, she started living with them.<br/>Charles felt pity for them. The girls were in their peak teen years, yet living in suffering, and those horrible boys still bullied them.<br/>They bonded so fast that they started joking with him and laughing together. They kept calling him uncle.<br/>After some minutes, Sapphire returned with the food she made—a simple pasta with some leaves and fruit to make it look pretty.<br/>Charles was the first allowed to taste it. Though the pasta looked cheap, it was so delicious.<br/>“Wow, this is the best pasta I have ever eaten,” he said. They all smiled and had dinner together.<br/>After they finished, Charles complimented the food more “Wow, I  wished there was more, thanks so much”.<br/> Sapphire shook her head and said, “No, it’s nothing compared to what you did. My niece would have died from that horrible boy…”<br/>Charles frowned. “This boy… What is it about him that you can’t report to the police?”<br/>Sapphire let out a long sigh as her smiled faded. “You know… he is the son of Mr. Damien. The most powerful, wealthy and influential man in this city.”<br/>Hearing the name, Charles raised his head. That was the information he had been looking for. This was what he was in Winchester for and the name just popped up like that. He leaned a little closer.<br/>“Really? If he is the son of an influential man that doesn’t give him immunity. He should suffer. In fact, the consequences should be worse since his father has more to lose.”<br/>They all scoffed, and Sapphire said, “I said he controls this city. Aside from that, Mr. Damien himself is a horrible man. He tramples on people, and he wouldn’t care if his son does the same.”<br/>Charles said, “Fuck… so he’s not a good man like the media paints him.”<br/>Sapphire scoffed. “Ugh, he owns them, so they will always say good things about him.”<br/>Charles sighed and finally understood why the Godfather wanted him to take the man’s wealth and kill him. Then he asked, “But why would his son target you both? Why bully you?”<br/>The aunt lowered her eyes. “It is because of me. I caused it.”<br/>The girls quickly shook their heads. “No, it’s not your fault, Aunt. You can’t just sell your dream and your body.”<br/>Charles frowned. “What happened?”<br/>The aunt inhaled slowly. “You must have heard about CHENG Enterprises and their innovations… all their new creations and inventions.”<br/>Charles nodded.<br/>Sapphire said, “Well, that never happened. CHENG never invents or innovates anything…”<br/>She explained, “CHENG Enterprises doesn’t want any competitors. They don’t know how to create anything, and when they see another company with real innovation that could overshadow them, they don’t let it grow. Instead, they hijack small companies and buy their discoveries. They pay money and pretend they created it.”<br/>Charles listened closely as she continued.<br/>“If someone refuses the money, they threaten him. They use the police, the prosecutors, anyone they control, to force the person. One way or another the company gives up their work, and CHENG publicly acts like it’s their invention.”<br/>She explained further that they would go as far as killing those that refused to the end. <br/>She sighed. “I’m in the same situation now. I finally created my childhood dream… a self-learning micro-AI board that can rewrite its own code and adapt to any device it’s plugged into. Such a device never exists, so sure, it will go viral and I will certainly  make it big. People showed great interest in it. But as usual, CHENG Enterprises wants it, and I refused.”<br/>She gulped and exhaled loudly before continuing,  <br/>“Mr. Damien started harassing me,” she said quietly. “He told me to marry him and he would give me everything. He said a woman who is smart and pretty should belong to him.”<br/>Tina added, “She refused. Now they want to force her. He’s using his son, Paul, to bully me and Amara so she will give in.”<br/>Charles frowned hard. “Wow… that man… he is an animal.”<br/>He was already feeling the urge to kill Mr. Damien, but he knew it wouldn’t be an easy task.</div>
