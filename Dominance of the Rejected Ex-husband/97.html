        <h1>Chapter 97</h1>
        <div><p>Charles used his sprinting power and made a flash move to where Wilson stood. In a blink he snatched the gun and pressed it to Wilson’s head.</p><p>Everyone gasped. It was so fast no one could react.</p><p>Cold metal against his skull. Wilson immediately started to shriek.</p><p>“What the hell do you think you are doing? Do you know who I am? Pull the trigger and you will take your life too!” Wilson yelled.</p><p>Charles scoffed. “At least you will be dead by then. I do not care. On the count of three tell your men to drop their guns or I will blow your head off.”</p><p>Wilson laughed in disbelief. “Ahah, fuck you. You think I will be scared? This is my territory. Do you know how many of my men are surrounding us?”</p><p>Boom!!!</p><p>Charles fired. The bullet hit Wilson’s leg.</p><p>“Ahhh!” Wilson screamed, clutching his wound. Blood poured out.</p><p>The men went rigid. Charles barked, “If anyone moves I swear I will blow your boss’s head off. Drop your guns now.”</p><p>They hesitated. Charles tightened his grip on the gun at Wilson’s temple.</p><p>Wilson, writhing in pain, realized Charles was not bluffing. He shouted at his men. “Are you all crazy? Do what he says now!”</p><p>One by one they began to drop their weapons.</p><p>“Please do not kill me. Tell Mr. Hat tell him what you want,” Wilson begged, still holding his leg.</p><p>Charles kept the gun leveled. “It is simple. Give me the stones that are worth my money. And give that lady back, Tracy. You dumped her. Return her money.”</p><p>Wilson sniffed. “You are not going to survive the aftermath. Use your sense.”</p><p>Charles sneered. “You are the one who has lost his senses. Any more nonsense and I will blow your head off.”</p><p>“All right. I will give them back,” Wilson wailed.</p><p>Tracy stood frozen and terrified.</p><p>“What are you waiting for? Do it!” Charles shouted.</p><p>They immediately moved. The thugs gathered the stones and handed them to Charles. They fetched Tracy’s money. Charles kept the gun against Wilson for assurance. Lizzypie stood calm, impressed by Charles’s bravery.</p><p>“I have done what you want. Now let me go,” Wilson begged.</p><p>Charles dragged him out with the gun still at his head. Everyone cleared a path. Charles, Tracy and Lizzypie forced their way out of the compound.</p><p>Once they were clear, Charles shoved Wilson away and they jumped into a Tracy waiting car and drove off.</p><p>Below Wilson roared, “I swear I will find you and kill you. I am Wilson of the Titan. Consider yourselves gone.”</p><p>They stopped on the main road. City lights flickered. Charles killed the engine and opened his door. Tracy climbed out first. Lizzypie followed. Charles stayed by the car.</p><p>Tracy then faced him. Her voice shook. &quot;What the hell was that back there? You shot him? You shot Wilson?&quot;</p><p>“Yes. I did,” Charles said flatly.</p><p>“Any problem with that?” he added.</p><p>&quot;Are you insane?&quot; Tracy shrieked. &quot;Do you have any idea who he is? The heir to the Titan family! They will hunt us down like dogs! You never think! You just had to play the hero, didn&#x27;t you? You even shot him in the leg!&quot;</p><p>Lizzypie cut in, her voice dripping with irritation. &quot;I have never seen such hypocrisy. He just saved you from losing ten million dollars. He got your money back. And this is the thanks he gets?&quot;</p><p>Tracy let out a harsh, bitter laugh. &quot;Oh, so I should be grateful? Grateful that he&#x27;s put a death sentence over all our heads? The Titans won&#x27;t rest until we&#x27;re all dead! You&#x27;re not safe either, you know!&quot;</p><p>Charles regarded her with icy calm. &quot;If you want out, then give them back the money and walk away. It&#x27;s that simple.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Simple? You think it&#x27;s that simple?&quot; she snapped, her voice cracking. &quot;They&#x27;ll use me to get to you! I hate you! You always do this—you rush in, all guns blazing, and drag everyone else into your mess!&quot;</p><p>Charles stared at her. He had not expected this. Some minutes ago she had been crying. She had said she cared him. Now she was saying she hated him. He just nodded. </p><p>Lizzypie watched them both like she was reading a play. “So all that crying about loving Charles was just a performance. You were acting so you would be saved. You do not even feel it.”</p><p>Tracy’s face went red. She stepped forward. “Shut up. You have no idea what I am feeling right now.”</p><p>Charles put his hands up in a small, steady gesture. Charles raised a hand, a small, firm gesture that demanded silence. &quot;Enough. I did what had to be done. The choice is yours. Stand with us, or return the money and face the Titans alone.&quot;</p><p>Her bravado finally crumbled, Tracy’s voice dropped low.  &quot;I&#x27;m just... I&#x27;m scared we&#x27;re all going to get killed,&quot; she whispered,  &quot;So what do we do now?&quot;</p><p>Charles sighed. “You have my number. Call me whenever you feel any threat.”</p><p>Tracy stared at him, her eyes searching his face for a long moment, looking for some sign of the man she thought she knew.</p><p>Finding nothing, Charles simply turned away with Lizzypie. &quot;We&#x27;re leaving.&quot;</p><p>As they walked off, Tracy found one last ounce of spite. &quot;I hate you!&quot; she sneered at his retreating back. &quot;You&#x27;re always so arrogant! So sure you&#x27;re right!&quot;</p><p>Charles didn&#x27;t bother to turn around.</p><p>On their way, Lizzpie said.</p><p>“I hate that bitch.  Always self-centered, I can&#x27;t wait for you to ruin her, just as the Godfather commanded. Don&#x27;t forget, Charles. The clock is ticking.&quot;</p></div>
