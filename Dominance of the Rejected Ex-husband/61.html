        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div><p>Charles’s eyes widened as soon as he spotted the yellow sapphire stone. Though blue sapphires were known to be the most expensive, yellow sapphires followed closely..</p><p>He turned to Natasha and asked, “If this stone contains yellow sapphire gems, how much do you think it might be worth?”</p><p>Natasha eyed him suspiciously and smiled. “At least three hundred million dollars,” she said. “But yellow sapphires are rare. I don’t even think they exist in this region.”</p><p>But Charles was certain the stone he was holding contained a sapphire gem. He picked it up and said firmly, “I choose this one.”</p><p>Natasha took it from him and examined it closely. Then she whispered, “Look, I wouldn’t advise you to take this kind of stone. I’ve been in this business for years, and I can tell this one’s empty.”</p><p>The stone was rough, its surface uneven with irregular patterns. Stones like this usually contained nothing, so Natasha was genuinely concerned.</p><p>Charles said confidently, “Yeah, I’ll take it.”</p><p>He was stubbornly fixated on it. Seeing she couldn’t convince him, Natasha decided to let him have his way. They walked back to the others in the outer room.</p><p>When Norman, Derek, and the others saw the stone in his hand and could identify stones, they immediately burst into laughter.</p><p>Norman frowned. “What is this? Wait—don’t tell me you plan to strike ruby or sapphire with that stone. It’s obvious you can’t even identify a real gem.”</p><p>Derek burst out laughing. “You are the stupidest man alive! That stone contains nothing!”</p><p>Charles shot him a glare. “Plenty of talk. Are you still in on the bet? What’s your wager?”</p><p>Norman folded his arms, smirking. “l will bet twenty million dollars this stone contains absolutely nothing. I’m certain about it.”</p><p>Derek jumped in eagerly. “Count me in. I will stake my own two million.”</p><p>Charles smirked. “You sure, Derek? Because I’m pretty sure that’s the last two million you have got.”</p><p>Derek snapped, “Shut up! I have got more. This is just what I have on me right now, and I’m staking it.”</p><p>Charles nodded slowly. “Alright then.”</p><p>Norman glanced at him with mock amusement. “What about you? What are you putting up for the bet? Have you even paid for the stone yet?”</p><p>Charles gulped, he stepped more forward. “No. I haven’t paid… and I don’t have any money with me to stake.”</p><p>They all burst out laughing, mocking him. “I knew it! He is just a poor man, All he know is bluffing!” someone jeered.</p><p>Derek chimed in, “I told you all, he is the most useless man I have ever seen, why do you even come here in the first place if you know you don’t have any money”.</p><p>Norman also broke-shame him, “Pretending to be cool won’t take you anywhere, you&#x27;re supposed to be licking feet of people like us, that&#x27;s how you are going to be somebody!”.</p><p>Charles just stayed mute and didn’t talk, as everyone was abusing him.</p><p>Finally, Norman leaned forward. “So… how are you going to bet when you can’t even pay?”</p><p>Charles straightened and said, with a strange calm, “My fingers. I will bet my fingers.”</p><p>Everyone froze. Gasps filled the room. “Is he crazy?!” someone shouted. “Betting fingers on a stone that probably contains nothing?!”</p><p>Natasha leaned in, alarmed. “Uhm… are you serious? I will give you the stone for free and even lend you two million for the bet!”</p><p>Charles shook his head. “Thanks, Ms. Natasha, but I don’t take money from a woman.” He said it with a confident grin, A bit of conscience bit him, because he had begged Lizypie for money before. But now he just wanted to look cool.</p><p>He repeated firmly, “My fingers.”</p><p>Norman groaned, spreading his hands. “Are you sure? I hope everyone is hearing this—I don’t want to hear that someone’s being bullied!”</p><p>Derek grinned wickedly. “With your fingers gone, I’m sure you won’t be attracting Ms. Serena again!”</p><p>Norman smirked, He thought about it, if Charles lost his fingers, he would have a big advantage of getting Serene. </p><p>But Charles remained calm, certain he was right about the stone. “I am sure. My fingers,” he said again.</p><p>Then, with a flourish, Norman dropped his card into Natasha’s hand. “Withdraw twenty million dollars if I lose,” he said, his confidence absolute. He didn’t even doubt his own victory.</p><p>The betting was set. Natasha stepped forward and carefully brought out the stone cutter, the cold metal gleaming under the light. Everyone leaned in, eyes fixed on Charles, waiting eagerly.</p><p>Many were already certain this was the moment he would lose his fingers. </p><p> Derek leaned back, smirking. “It’s over for you, Charles,” he said, his voice dripping with mockery.</p><p>Charles didn’t flinch. He placed the stone firmly on the cutter, his hands steady. Natasha adjusted the machine, and the tension in the room thickened.</p><p>With a sharp inhale, she began the cut. The blade descended slowly, slicing through the rough surface. Everyone’s breath caught, hearts racing.</p><p>Just then, the blade hit something.</p><p>Natasha froze. There was something inside the stone. She immediately stopped the machine and grabbed a scraper, careful not to damage it as they usually would with all stones.</p><p>Everyone leaned in, their anticipation turning into disbelief. Now it was clear: this stone contained a gem. But many assumed it would be something cheap, maybe a $100,000 one at most.</p><p>As Natasha carefully scraped away the surface, a soft yellow light began to shimmer from within the stone, cutting across the room and striking everyone’s eyes. They squinted, shielding themselves instinctively.</p><p>Finally, Natasha lifted the gem out. Its shape was flawless, its figure unique, like a molten gold frozen mid-flow, glowing with its own inner light.”</p><p>She couldn’t hide her astonishment.</p><p>“It’s… it’s a yellow sapphire!” she exclaimed, her voice echoing across the room.</p></div>
