        <h1>Chapter 162</h1>
        <div>Sapphire gulped and said, “You are asking me to kill him?.”<br/>Mr. Damien nodded with a wicked grin on his face. “Yes. That is the only way I can forgive you for everything you’ve done.”<br/>Her hands shook so badly the remote rattled between her palms. She immediately dropped it. <br/>“Why would you say something like that, I can never do it!”.<br/>“If you refuse,” Damien calmly said. “I press my own button. Both of you explode anyway. So do yourself a favor. Kill this man and you live. You will also become my wife.”<br/>Sapphire stared at him. She was crying so hard her chest ached, mucus running from her nose as she tried to breathe.<br/>“No,” she whispered, then louder, shaking her head. “No. I can’t do that. I can never do that. Charles is my savior.”<br/>Damien laughed, a sharp ugly sound. “Really? You can never do that?” He tilted his head. “Then you will both die.”<br/>She dropped to sobbing again. “Please,” she said, words tumbling over each other. “I swear I will give you my body and my project. Everything you asked for. Please just let us go.”<br/>Damien’s eyes hardened. “Are you deaf? I said I will still take what I want. But I can’t guarantee you will live unless you kill this man.”<br/>He raised three fingers. “I will count to three. Kill him or die with him.”<br/>Sapphire nodded weakly, tears streaming, whispering that she couldn’t. That she couldn’t.<br/>Charles watched her, he was calm and determined.  “Sapphire,” he said, forcing strength into his voice. “Look at me.”<br/>She turned to him, eyes red and swollen. “What?... Don’t,” she said. “Don’t say it.”<br/>“You have to,” Charles said softly. He was saying it like it was nothing, meanwhile deep down, he didn’t know what to do. If Sapphire really pressed it, he  would die.<br/> “If this is the only way you can live. Go on with it”<br/>Her head jerked back in horror. “What are you saying? Are you crazy? You are asking me to kill you.”<br/>He nodded once. “I know. But there’s no other way.” He swallowed, pain cutting through his voice. “You have to take care of the girls. Please. Just do it.”<br/>Sapphire let out a broken cry, clutching the remote to her chest as if it were burning her skin. She shook her head over and over, caught between his eyes and Damien’s smile, knowing whatever she chose would destroy her forever.<br/>Sapphire sighed and stopped crying. Her shoulders steadied. She slowly raised her head and faced Damien, her eyes hollow but fierce.<br/>“Look at you,” she said. “A demon. I am not giving in to whatever you are saying. If you really want to kill us, go ahead and do it.”<br/>Damien glanced at Jasmine and chuckled. “Wow. Look at the drama. You two must be badly in love. You are even risking your life for him.”<br/>“This isn’t about love,” Sapphire said. “This is about being human and doing what is right. Go ahead and kill me. I don’t fucking care. I would rather die than live with the burden of killing someone with my own hands.”<br/>Damien’s smile vanished. “You are really crazy.” He picked up his own remote, his jaw tight. “You are making me more angry. I will kill both of you now.”<br/>Sapphire closed her eyes.<br/>Charles strained against the chair. “No, Sapphire. Don’t do this. You have to live. It would be a waste if both of us die. Please. Sapphire, just do It.”<br/>She didn’t answer. She kept her eyes closed waiting for her fate.<br/>Charles tried to look into the future. Nothing came. Just darkness. Damien was more than he thought. He had underestimated him. The machines in this room were sophisticated and refined. Something here was suppressing his power completely. He fought to force even a fragment of it to respond, but nothing moved.<br/>Damien pressed the red button.<br/>He grinned, waiting, eager for skulls to burst and their bodies to drop.<br/>Sapphire’s face tightened as she waited for death. While Charles already also accepts his fate. <br/>Five seconds passed. Ten. Twenty.<br/>Nothing happened.<br/>Damien’s grin collapsed. His eyes widened as he stared at the remote, then at them.<br/>“That’s impossible,” he muttered. “It should have worked instantly.”<br/>Damien froze, shock flashing across his face. He smashed the button again, this time frantically, his thumb jabbing it over and over.<br/>Yet, nothing happened!.<br/>“What the fuck is happening?” he snapped, turning on Jasmine.<br/>Jasmine looked just as stunned. He snatched the remote from his hand, slammed it against his palm, and pressed it himself <br/>Nothing happened.<br/>Sapphire opened her eyes slowly, disbelief washing over her. She was still breathing. Still alive. Every time Jasmine pressed the remote again, Sapphire flinched, waiting for her head to explode.<br/>But nothing happened.<br/>“What the fuck happened?” Damien roared. “This thing works. What did you do to it?”<br/>The room was packed with gadgets and electronics. Jasmine rushed to a nearby console, his fingers flying as he checked multiple systems. He moved to another machine, then another, his face draining of color. He ran to the main computer and started typing fast.<br/>Then he froze.<br/>“Boss,” he said.<br/>Damien spun toward him. “What.”<br/>“We are being hijacked,” Jasmine said, panic creeping into his voice. “Someone is jamming us. They are killing every network and connection in the room. That’s why nothing is working.”<br/>“What?” Damien barked. “Who the fuck is it?”<br/>“I’m trying to trace it,” Jasmine said, typing harder, sweat on his forehead. Then he shouted, “Sir. This person is a pro. Better than me. They are destroying everything here.”<br/>Screens went dark one by one. Machines sparked and died. The hum of power in the room faded into silence.<br/>Damien turned slowly toward Charles.<br/>Charles lifted his head and smirked. He knew exactly what was happening now. “I told you,” he said hoarsely. “Your days are numbered.”<br/>Damien’s face twisted with rage. “What the fuck did you do to my operating room?”<br/>“Sir,” Jasmine said quickly. “Every hard drive is frying. Whoever this is, they are wiping everything.”<br/>Damien snarled, pulled out his gun, and raised it at Charles. “Fine,” he said. “I will just kill you the old way, you motherfucker—”<br/>Click.<br/>The sound echoed in the room.<br/>The electric handcuffs on Charles and Sapphire snapped open and fell to the floor.</div>
