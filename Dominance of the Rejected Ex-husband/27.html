        <h1>Chapter 27.</h1>
        <div>Derek folded his arms and laughed. “I knew it! Look at what he used to wrap a supposed expensive gift—a rag cloth! This is what happens when a broke man tries to act rich.”<br/>The guests erupted.<br/>“Hah! He must have picked that off the street!”<br/> “Imagine bringing trash to a party like this!”<br/> “Cheap people always expose themselves in the end.”<br/>Mr. Moretti sighed heavily, his face darkening. “Please, young man, you can still leave now. I’ve been patient enough because you saved my daughter, but don’t push my tolerance further.”<br/>Before Charles could reply, Derek snatched the package from his hand. With exaggerated disgust, he shook off the rough cloth, dust scattering into the air, and revealed a small ring box.<br/>Derek laughed loudly. “A ring box? Please. At best it’ll contain a cheap two-thousand-dollar ring. You can’t even afford a proper suit, yet you show up here looking for connections. Our parties aren’t for people like you, Charles!”<br/>The crowd roared with cruel laughter, some even clapping at Derek’s jab. Charles, however, stood calmly, his eyes fixed on Derek.<br/> “Go on,” he said quietly.<br/>Derek smirked and flicked the box open.<br/>The moment the lid rose, a burst of brilliance lit the air.<br/>A dazzling white gleam flashed like lightning, reflecting off the chandeliers and striking Derek full in the face. He flinched, blinking furiously as the crowd gasped.<br/>Inside was a four-stone diamond ring, each stone massive, perfectly cut, and radiating fire. The diamonds caught every angle of light, throwing sharp glimmers across the hall.<br/>The room fell silent.<br/>“No… no way…” someone whispered. “That can’t be real.” “It’s shining like the sun…”<br/>Gasps and murmurs rippled through the guests as they leaned in, eyes wide with disbelief.<br/>Derek’s mocking grin faltered. His hand trembled as he tilted the box, inspecting the ring from every angle. The brilliance never faded. It only grew stronger under the lights.<br/>He rubbed his eyes, bent closer, even held it up, but no matter what he did, the brilliance held steady. Sweat formed on his forehead. “This… this seems to be real. No, it can’t be. It’s impossible!”<br/>Just then, one of the guests shouted. “Wait!. I know that ring! It’s an eight-carat sapphire diamond ring. The very one the Prince of England gave his wife. It’s worth at least a million dollars!”<br/>The hall erupted.<br/> “One million dollars?!”<br/> “What the hell!...how is that possible?!”<br/>Derek’s legs began to shake.<br/>Charles stepped forward, his voice cutting like ice. “Derek, tell me…what was your gift? Does it even come close to a hundred thousand dollars?”<br/>Derek had offered an $80,000 ceramic vase, thinking he had secured victory. But Charles had just swallowed that pride whole one hundred times over.<br/>“I… I…” Derek stammered, his lips trembling, not knowing what to say.<br/>Charles narrowed his eyes, his voice sharp as a blade. “You lost. Now bark like a dog and lick my shoes.”<br/>If looks could kill, Derek would have struck Charles dead on the spot. His pride and rage boiled, but his legs weakened under the piercing weight of Charles’s glare.<br/>“There’s no way I’ll bark like a dog in front of everyone!” Derek roared back, desperate. His voice cracked, hoarse, his eyes bloodshot. He turned to the crowd, pointing wildly. “His ring is fake! It’s fake, isn’t it? Tell me! it’s fake!”<br/>Charles only sneered, calm as ever. “Funny. Just a moment ago, someone in this crowd recognized it for what it is—an eight-carat sapphire diamond ring. The very same design used in a royal engagement.”<br/>“What utter nonsense! Who said that? Stand up!” Derek bellowed. “Let’s see if you dare back that claim!”<br/>The crowd fell into uneasy silence. The noblewoman who had spoken earlier shrank back into the group, unwilling to face Derek’s fury.<br/>Derek straightened, seizing the opening. If no one stepped up, he could cast doubt.<br/> “That’s what I thought,” he sneered. “It’s probably just a clever fake. You knew Serena doesn’t like flashy luxuries, so you thought you could slip it past us. A bold move, but still fake.”<br/>His words lacked conviction. Even he wanted the situation to end. “But I’m generous,” he added bitterly. “I won’t stoop to your level. Just get out of here before the police come and arrest you for fraud.”<br/>Charles didn’t move. Not an inch.<br/>The smirk slid off Derek’s face, replaced by a scowl. His voice cracked like a whip.<br/> “Guards! Throw this scumbag out right now. We shouldn’t let someone like him stay here any longer. The ring is fake!”<br/>“This is the Moretti estate, not your backyard. You have no right to give orders here!” Charles snapped.<br/>Taking advantage of Derek’s distraction, Charles snatched the diamond ring back. He turned calmly to Mr. Moretti. “He says it’s fake, and I say it’s real. Since that’s the case. Mr. Ashford, would you mind checking it?”<br/>But before Mr. Moretti could answer, a woman in the crowd yelled, “Why bother checking? It’s clearly fake!”<br/>One of the big investors, Mr. Vasilios, groaned in annoyance. “I’m getting tired of this poor lowlife disturbing us. Can someone please send him out already?”.<br/>Derek immediately seized the moment. “Mr. Moretti, all the guests here agree it’s fake. Surely you won’t doubt our judgment, will you? He’s just a poor man…please, send him away quickly.”<br/>Moretti frowned, clearly irritated. Derek was becoming insufferable. It was one thing to throw insults, but now he was trying to force decisions on him.<br/>Mr. Moretti was stuck.  If he confirmed the ring was real, he risked offending the guests, who were siding with Derek. None of them wanted Charles to win.<br/> If he claimed it was fake, the Moretti family’s credibility would suffer, it would seem like ingratitude after Charles had saved his daughter.<br/> And if he openly opposed Derek, the purpose of this gathering, to secure partnerships and collaborations might collapse.<br/>He was trapped.<br/>Meanwhile, Serena sat quietly, her eyes fixed on Charles, waiting to see how this impossible situation would resolve itself.</div>
