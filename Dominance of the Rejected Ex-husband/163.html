        <h1>Chapter 163</h1>
        <div>Charles moved the instant the cuffs fell.<br/>[Eyes of Satan activated]<br/>He finally get to activate his superpower<br/>Charles surged forward.<br/>Damien barely had time to blink before Charles was on him. His hand clamped over the gun, twisted hard, faster than thought. To collect the gun from him. Charles broke one of his fingers.<br/>“Yaaaaa!”.<br/>Damien screamed. A raw animal sound. As the finger bent the wrong way and the gun flew from his grip.<br/>Charles caught it and stepped back in the same motion, arm straight, as he  leveled it at Damien’s forehead.<br/>“Don’t move,” Charles said, his voice low and steady.<br/>Jasmine reacted instantly.<br/>He drew his own gun and lunged to Sapphire, yanking her back against his chest. He pressed the gun under her chin.<br/>“Drop the gun. Now,” Jasmine shouted. “Or I kill her.”<br/>Sapphire gasped but didn’t scream. She froze.<br/>Damien stood there clutching his broken hand, shock written all over his face. Then slowly, a smile crept back.<br/>“You heard him,” Damien said, forcing calm. “You better drop the gun.”<br/>Charles didn’t blink.<br/>“Why should I,” he said. “If he shoots her, I shoot you. Simple.”<br/>Damien swallowed. He studied Charles again, really looked at him this time.<br/>“I see now,” Damien said. “You are special. Fast and strong ” His smile widened. “Let’s not waste talent. I can pardon you. I will make you my bodyguard. Two million dollars a month. That’s money you will never see in your life.”<br/>Charles laughed short and cold.<br/>“Shut up,” he said. “Fuck you and your money. Let her go. Right now. Or else, i will blow your head off”<br/>Jasmine tightened his grip on Sapphire.<br/>“Hey,” he said. “Easy. You drop your gun and I drop mine. Fair trade.”<br/>The room went dead silent.<br/>Charles’ eyes flicked to Jasmine’s stance, he was calculating the angle of his arm, the distance between the gun and Sapphire’s skull, it was  too close.  He could target jasmine very well, but if sapphire made any wrong move underway she would get hit and die. <br/> He didn't want to take the risk. <br/>Instead, Charles spoke as he  lowered the gun a fraction.<br/>“Okay,” he said. “You and your dog can walk away from here, and just  leave Sapphire.”<br/>Damien scoffed. “What’s your trick?”<br/>“Shut up,” Charles said. “There’s no trick. You can keep her as a shield until you reach the door. But before you step out, you let her go.”<br/>Jasmine glanced at Damien.<br/>Damien hesitated, then nodded.<br/>Jasmine pressed the gun harder under Sapphire’s chin. “Fine. Don’t try anything stupid. One funny move and I lodge a bullet in her head.”<br/>Charles didn’t move. “Same goes for you. Touch her , and I wll break every bone in your body before I kill you.”<br/>Jasmine hauled Sapphire upright and dragged her toward the door.<br/>“Sir,” he said. “You can leave.”<br/>Damien began backing away, slow and careful, still holding his broken finger. His eyes never left Charles.<br/>“This isn’t over,” Damien said. “I swear I will come back for you.”<br/>He stepped through the doorway and disappeared.<br/>Jasmine shoved Sapphire forward, hard enough that she stumbled into Charles’ chest. Then he turned and sprinted out after Damien.<br/>The door slammed shut.<br/>Charles wrapped his arms around Sapphire.<br/>She broke down completely, sobbing into his chest. “I’m sorry,” she cried. “I’m sorry for dragging you into all this.”<br/>“I know,” Charles said softly, rubbing her back. “It’s okay. It’s over now.”<br/>“I was so scared, I thought you would die because of me” she sniffled. <br/>“It’s okay,” he said again. “Everything is fine now.”<br/>Just then, the door creaked open.<br/>Sapphire jerked upright, panic flashing across her face. She clutched Charles, thinking Damien had come back.<br/>But it wasn’t him.<br/>“Lizzypie?” Sapphire said, stunned.<br/>Charles wasn’t surprised. He already knew when the network got jammed. <br/>Lizzypie stood there staring at them, eyes sharp, face tight with fury. She was seriously burning. <br/>Charles asked calmly, “How did you know we were here?”<br/>She glared at him like she wanted to slap him. “You nearly died,” she snapped. “What the hell did you think you were doing? You both came here without telling me.”<br/>Sapphire stepped forward, shaking. “I’m sorry. This is my fault. I dragged him here to get something I lost and Mr. Damein captured us.”<br/>Lizzypie turned on her. “Yeah. It is your fucking fault.” Her voice cracked. “He could have died. And I would never have forgiven you.”<br/>Sapphire swallowed hard, guilt crushing her.<br/>Charles stepped in. “It’s fine.”<br/>Lizzypie spun on him. “Fine?” she shouted. “You think this is fine?” Her chest rose sharply. “Do you know how worried I was? I saw everything. Everything. I almost went insane breaking into this place’s network just to stop your head from blowing off.”<br/>Her voice shook. Tears slipped down her cheeks before she could stop them.<br/>Charles froze, stunned. Lizzypie had always been cold. Ruthless. Seeing her cry hit him harder.<br/>“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “And… Thank you. You saved us.”<br/>She sniffed angrily, wiping her face.<br/>Charles tilted his head. “Are you crying? You must have been worried sick. Guess you can’t live without me.”<br/>“Shut up,” she snapped. “You idiot.”<br/>She turned toward the exit. “Get up. Both of you. Let's leave here .”<br/>They stood and followed her.<br/>As they moved through the corridor, Charles finally took a proper look around. The place looked unfinished from the outside, but inside it was packed with machines, power lines, and high-end equipment. Clean. Organized and Dangerous.<br/>Damien had built this place for illegal work. No doubt about it.<br/>As they walked, Charles spoke again.<br/>“You still haven’t answered me,” he said. “How did you know we were here?”<br/>Lizzypie kept walking.<br/>“I came here to investigate Damien,” she said. “I found this hideout weeks ago and bugged it. I was waiting for him to slip. Illegal deals. Recordings. Proof to drag him down.” Her voice hardened. “Then I saw them bring you two in.”<br/>She glanced back at Charles. “I heard everything. I knew I had to jam the network or your head would have blown off.”<br/>Charles exhaled slowly and nodded. “wow..what a coincidence,  we could have really died.”<br/>Sapphire frowned and curiously asked, “You are investigating Damien?” She hesitated. “Are you a cop?”<br/>Lizzypie didn’t answer. She didn’t even look at her.<br/>Sapphire didn't push forward either. Since she knew nothing about Charles’ real identity.<br/>They reached the end of the passage.<br/>Just as they were about to step outside, all three of them stopped.<br/>A shadow stood ahead, blocking the exit.<br/>Charles moved instantly, stepping in front of them. He raised the gun.<br/>“Who the fuck is that,” he said.<br/>The shadow stepped forward into the light.<br/>It was a man. Tall with broad shoulders. A long dark jacket hanging from his frame. His face was calm. Too calm and dangerous<br/>Charles’ grip tightened on the gun.</div>
