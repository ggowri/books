        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div><p>The last owner of the Nytheris Stone had constantly faced robbery attempts—people had tried to steal it countless times. To prevent this, they had created a highly detailed counterfeit model, painted to look exactly like the Nytheris Black Stone.</p><p>They had also removed the main core of the real Nytheris Stone and placed it inside a rough, grey-looking stone, making it nearly impossible to recognize. This way, even if someone tried to steal it, they would take only the fake.</p><p>The fake stone was the one Norman had bought, while Charles had obtained the original.</p><p>Norman was still seething, his face red with rage.</p><p>“No! I won’t accept this! You have to give me that stone! It was supposed to be mine! What are you looking at? Get that stone for me!”</p><p>Charles’s smile didn’t waver.</p><p>“You bid on your stone and you got it. I bid on mine and I got it. Where should I give it to you?”</p><p>Norman’s face went purple with fury. “You— you knew the stone was fake and intentionally drove the bid up so I’d waste my money on a painted rock, and then you get the real one for three hundred dollars? That’s not fair!” He spun toward the auctioneer, voice raw. “Are you both in this together? Did you try to rip me off?”</p><p>The auctioneer, shaken and pale, stammered, “I— I swear I don’t know. We thought that was the Nytheris Stone.” He tried to steady himself under the sudden storm.</p><p>“Since this is the Nytheris Stone,” Norman snapped, “give it to me right now.”</p><p>The auctioneer turned to Charles, desperation in his eyes. “Sir, there’s been a mistake. You must return that stone.”</p><p>Charles folded his arms, amused. “We made payment. We have an agreement. Why should I return it?”</p><p>“Listen,” the auctioneer pleaded, voice rising with the panic of a man who suddenly understood how much was at stake, “this is a big misunderstanding. We can compensate you—reasonable money. Four hundred million. That should be fair. Please return it.”</p><p>Charles laughed softly, cold. “Bids and auctions don’t work like that. Everyone gets what they bid for. I won it. I am not returning it. I am not selling it.”</p><p>The auctioneer’s jaw dropped. “Then you leave me no choice. Guards!”</p><p>Two hulking security men surged forward, their boot heels thudding on the floor. They reached for Charles in a single motion.</p><p>“Get that stone from him right now!”  he roared.</p><p>Then, they lunged at him. Charles moved like a shadow. Before the guards could close the distance he stepped aside, then with fluid and brutal moves, he knocked them both down with a pair of precise, almost effortless moves. They hit the floor with heavy thuds and they instantly passed out.</p><p>Gasps turned to an awed chorus.</p><p> “Did you see that?”.</p><p> “He’s incredible!” .</p><p>“He knocked two guards out in seconds!”</p><p>The auctioneer was shocked and roared into his radio. “I want special forces here now!” His voice trembled.</p><p>Norman, chest heaving and eyes blazing, advanced a step, voice low and threatening. “You better return that stone before this gets messy.”</p><p>The special guards rushed inside, weapons at the ready. The auctioneer raised his voice, panicked.</p><p>“Collect the stone! Take it now!”</p><p>Before they could move, a commanding voice rang out from behind.</p><p>“What do you all think you’re doing?”</p><p>Everyone turned—and there it was Diana, with Serena standing closely behind her. Norman’s face twisted in fury.</p><p>Diana’s gaze swept over the guards and the auctioneer.</p><p>“He won the bid fair and square. The bid was made, and he won it. What are you doing now? Want to bully him for the stone? Go ahead—and I will personally have each of you arrested.”</p><p>Norman’s voice cracked as he shouted,</p><p>“But I was ripped off! They told me that it was the Nytheris Stone!”</p><p>Diana’s eyes were icy.</p><p>“Maybe your problem is with them, not Charles. So just… shut up.”</p><p>Norman’s shoulders slumped. Devastation washed over him. Diana’s tone softened slightly.</p><p>“If you really feel you were ripped off, you can try to collect your money from them.”</p><p>He knew that was almost impossible. It was an auction; what he’d bid was legally binding. Perhaps the auction house might offer 50–70% compensation if there had been a mistake—but that still meant he would lose the stone to Charles. His father had already warned him in no uncertain terms: he must get that stone, or he would be disowned.</p><p>With desperation creeping into his voice, Norman turned to Charles and held out a trembling hand.</p><p>“Please… please sell it to me. I will give you ten billion dollars!”</p><p>A hush fell over the room. Ten billion that an astronomical sum for someone like Charles.</p><p>People murmured among themselves, eyes darting between Charles and Norman.</p><p>“He originally got it for 300 dollars. Ten billion is an insane profit. He should take it!”</p><p>“Yes, he should sell it off, he wouldn’t even know what to do with it anyway” another whispered.</p><p>Charles looked at Norman, </p><p>“No,” he said simply. “I’m not interested. I will keep it.”</p><p>Norman blinked, disbelief twisting into rage.</p><p>“What?” He stepped forward. “Okay—twenty billion dollars!”</p><p>Charles let out a low scoff, a faint smirk tugging at his lips.</p><p>“Even if you bring all your family’s wealth, I’m not selling it. So stop trying.”</p><p>This hit Norman like a slap. His face darkened, his jaw trembling with fury.</p><p>“I swear,” he growled, voice low and dangerous, “you would better sell that stone to me right now or else I will take it by force… even if it’s over your dead body.”</p><p>He slammed his fist against the railing and stormed out of the hall.</p><p>The tension broke instantly. People surged toward Charles, excitement buzzing through the air. </p><p>“Mr. Charles, congratulations!”</p><p>“You are incredible—no one could’ve spotted that stone’s true core except you!”</p><p>“Even seasoned collectors wouldn’t have noticed it! You are truly something else!”</p><p>Powerful businessmen, politicians, and aristocrats surrounded him, shaking his hand, praising him, trying to get close. Flashing cameras, eager reporters, all centered on him.</p><p>Through the commotion, Serena walked toward Charles.</p><p>“What can I even call you?” she said quietly. “There’s something off about you… Are you talented or just impossibly lucky?”</p><p>Charles smiled faintly, the Nytheris Stone still glowing softly in his hand.</p><p>“With this stone,” she continued, “you are a billionaire now, which is the reason everyone wants to associate with you. That’s… great for you.”</p><p>“Yes, my lady,” Charles slowly replied.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tracy stood from afar, fuming with jealousy.</p></div>
