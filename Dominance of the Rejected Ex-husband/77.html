        <h1>chapter 77</h1>
        <div><p>Charles returned home after that embarrassing moment. He had tried to convince Tracy, but she was too deep in her arrogance and pride, seeing Charles as someone just spewing nonsense to get her attention.</p><p>When he arrived home, Lizzypie stared at him with that I told you so gaze. </p><p>She had already seen everything from the camera feed. Charles had let his hope rise too high on Tracy because she had called to warn him and saved his life.</p><p>“Well, I think you have seen what you were looking for,” she teased.</p><p>Charles didn’t reply. He just sank into the sofa, his face blank.</p><p>Lizzypie sighed and sat beside him.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry about last night,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t have argued. I see you have a good heart—you see the best in people. But kindness alone won&#x27;t get you far in this world. You need to become the Godfather, Charles. Soon, you&#x27;ll need that power. Don&#x27;t throw it all away for someone who doesn&#x27;t care about you. Please.&quot;</p><p>Her tone carried real concern.</p><p>Charles frowned. The part where Lizzypie said you’ll need to become the Godfather soon made him curious. He leaned forward and asked, “Why should I even become the Godfather?”</p><p>Lizzypie bit her lip and looked down. “Mmm... because you want to. Right? That’s the reason you are on this mission.”</p><p>Charles’ voice deepened. “Mr. Vincent could have just given me the power to become the Godfather. But he wanted me to take this mission seriously before earning it. I think there’s more to it. Can you tell me, please?”</p><p>His eyes were pleading now.</p><p>Lizzypie sighed. She didn’t want to answer, but seeing how serious he was, she gave in. “Look, I only know a little,” she began. “Mr. Vincent knows it all... your parents didn’t die in an accident. They were murdered, Charles. Killed by some cultivators in this world. And whoever killed them... they’re looking for you too.”</p><p>Charles froze.“What did you say?”</p><p>“It’s true,” she whispered. “There are others in this world with abilities. We call them cultivators. Each has a unique source of power—and yours lies in your eyes. The ones who killed your parents… they’re still out there. Hunting you, too.”</p><p>Charles felt the air leave his lungs. His heart hammered against his ribs.</p><p><em>Murdered. Not an accident. Hunted.</em></p><p>Rage brewed inside him. He had lived his life as an orphan, struggled from nothing, carried the pain of losing everything. Now he knew it wasn’t fate—it was someone’s doing. This made him so mad.</p><p>“But why?” he demanded, voice shaking. “Why kill them? Why come after me?”</p><p>“I don’t know the reason,” Lizzypie admitted. “Your parents were powerful, wealthy—they had enemies. But that doesn’t explain why you’re a target, too.”</p><p>“Then I’ll ask Vincent myself—”</p><p>“No!” Her eyes widened in alarm. “Don’t you dare. He didn’t want you to know yet. I only told you because you were losing your way. If he finds out I opened my mouth…” She shook her head. “Just become the Godfather. Gain the power, the influence. Then you’ll get your answers—who killed them, and why they want you dead.”</p><p>Her words hit him hard. She was right. </p><p>Charles took a deep breath. His anger had turned into focus. “So, the Figs of Vigour is ready now, right? Can we go to Mr. Vasilios?” he asked.</p><p>Lizzypie nodded slowly. “Yeah, it’s ready. But… since it’s only one dose, I don’t know if it will work. We haven’t tested it yet, and I’m a little scared. Skeptical, even.”</p><p>Charles frowned. “Mmm… but you prepared it well, right?”</p><p>“Yeah,” she said. “Absolutely. But every medicine needs to be tested first. What if it doesn’t work? Or worse—what if it harms him? You will be in danger.”</p><p>Charles saw the concern in her eyes. She wasn’t just afraid for the result, she was afraid for him. He nodded, his tone calm but determined. “Look, we just have to have faith and go with it. We have made it this far; we can’t back down now. Let’s try it.”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded repeatedly, worried still in her face.</p><p>The next morning, the sun was high and sharp. Charles dressed neatly and made his way to Mr. Vasilios ’ villa.</p><p>The building was huge—an elegant estate surrounded by trimmed lawns, marble fences, and a long, paved road that led to the gate. It screamed wealth. The Vasilos family was clearly powerful.</p><p>Charles stood at the entrance, staring up at the giant iron gate. Before he could press the bell, two security guards appeared and double-crossed him.</p><p>“Hey, who are you, and what are you doing here?” one of them demanded, his tone rough.</p><p>“I want to see Mr. Vasilios” Charles replied.</p><p>They eyed him suspiciously from head to toe. He wasn’t dressed poorly, but he wasn’t wearing anything fancy either—simple shirt, neat trousers, calm expression. The guards scoffed.</p><p>“Do you have an appointment with him?”</p><p>Charles shook his head. “No. But please, just inform him it’s me—Charles, Ms. Serena’s fiancé.”</p><p>The moment they heard that, their attitude changed. Serena was a big name, someone so wealthy, respected, and well-known. If this man was her fiancé, then he wasn’t just anyone. The guards hesitated, exchanging glances.</p><p>One reached for his radio, ready to call in, when a sharp voice came from behind.</p><p>“Wait! What the hell are you doing here?”</p><p>Charles stopped in his tracks. He knew that voice instantly. His body stiffened as he slowly turned.</p><p>Norman was walking toward him, wearing a furious expression.</p><p></p></div>
