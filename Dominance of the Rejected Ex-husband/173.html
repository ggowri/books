        <h1>Chapter 173</h1>
        <div>---<br/>Reaper and Zander stood in shock, eyes wide at the glowing aura swirling around Razor's fists. This was their first time seeing real magic. Even their men froze, mouths open.<br/>“That’s… magic,” Reaper muttered, voice trembling. “He uses magic. No wonder he can kill so many at once. He’s going to kill the boss too!”<br/>Meanwhile, the fight began.<br/>Razor charged first. He thrust his fist forward, and the aura tore through the air like a sharp blade.<br/>Charles reacted on instinct. He twisted aside, just inches away as the aurora attack slammed into a parked car behind him.<br/>BOOM!!!<br/>The explosion was violent. The car burst into ashes in seconds. The shockwave ripped through the circle of men, forcing them to stagger back.<br/>A low murmur spread through the crowd.<br/>Razor smiled. Then, in a blink, he vanished, not literally, just too fast to track. One moment he was ten steps away; the next, he was already inside Charles’s guard.<br/>Charles activated his Flash Power and lunged forward. His fists glowed, as his vision sharpened with X-ray sight locking onto Razor’s muscles and joints.<br/>He aimed a punch at a weak point, he threw the punch but missed.<br/>Razor slipped past every strike like smoke. Each blow hit only air. Charles felt him brush past his shoulder, his back, his side. Razor was impossibly fast.<br/>SMACK!!!<br/>Razor’s glowing fist smashed into Charles’s ribs. Charles flew backward, body crashing into the ground. He slid several meters before stopping. Concrete cracked beneath him.<br/>Razor walked toward him slowly, full of confidence.<br/>“You are even weaker than before,” he said calmly. “Stand up. Let us finish this.”<br/>Charles coughed blood and pushed himself up. His legs shook, but he straightened his back. He closed his eyes.<br/>[SOUL SIGHT activated]<br/>As always, he glimpsed the future to predict Razor’s moves. But in that split second, Razor was already on him. A powerful kick sent Charles spinning through the air. A heavy punch followed, clean and brutal.<br/>Another blow slammed into his chest, hurling him across the ground again.<br/>Crack. <br/>Charles' ribs shifted inside him.<br/>Reaper shouted in panic. Zander grabbed his arm.<br/>“Someone needs to call RAIN,” Zander whispered urgently. “Or the Godfather. Now.”<br/>Soul Sight ended. Charles rolled to his feet and snapped his eyes open.<br/>This time, he moved first. Razor stepped in exactly as predicted. Charles ducked under the punch and drove his fist deep into Razor’s ribs.<br/>Flash Power surged. Punch after punch landed, fast, precise, hitting every opening he had foreseen.<br/>Razor staggered.<br/>Charles pressed the attack. A hook. An elbow. A knee. Every strike connected cleanly.<br/>“Yes! Master is winning!” Reaper grinned.<br/>But it didn’t last. The five minutes of prediction ran out. Everything returned to normal.<br/>Razor recovered and took control again.<br/>His smile widened as he closed in. His fists glowed brighter.<br/>He grabbed Charles by the collar and yanked him up. A knee smashed into Charles’s gut—hard.<br/>Charles’s mouth flew open. Blood sprayed out as all air left his lungs.<br/>Another punch crashed into his jaw, snapping his head sideways. Teeth cracked. More blood poured down his chin.<br/>Razor didn’t stop.<br/>Left hook to the face, Charles’s cheek split wide open.<br/>Right uppercut to the ribs, his bones cracked louder this time.<br/>Charles tried to raise his arms, but they fell limp. Razor flattened his nose with a final punch. Blood exploded across the ground.<br/>Charles dropped to his knees. His body shook. Blood poured heavily from his mouth, nose, and swollen eyes. His shirt was soaked red. He couldn’t stand. Could barely breathe.<br/>Razor turned to his men, arms spread wide, laughing.<br/>“Look at this weak, delusional man!” he shouted. “He actually thought he could beat me—the almighty Razor, the number one assassin in this city!”<br/>His men cheered wildly. “Master Razor! Finish him! Kill him now!”<br/>Reaper and Zander stood frozen with their own men, faces pale with fear.<br/>Reaper whispered, voice shaking, “We should run… After he finishes the boss, he will come for us next.”<br/>Zander gripped his arm tighter. “You think we can run? It’s too late. Our fate is sealed. We’re dead men.”<br/>Razor turned back to Charles, still kneeling, head hanging low.<br/>He kicked Charles hard in the chest. Charles fell backward, coughing up more blood.<br/>Razor stepped on Charles’s hand and ground his boot down. Bones snapped.<br/>“YAAAA!” Charles groaned in agony.<br/>“Pathetic,” Razor said, bending close. “When you get to hell, help me greet my grandma… and the two thousand others I’ve killed.”<br/>He straightened up, ready to deliver the final blow.<br/>At that moment, Charles slowly raised his head. Blood covered his face, but he smirked.<br/>Perfect. This was the moment.<br/>He closed his eyes deeply. <br/>[Hellfire Beam activated]<br/>His eyes opened slowly, first normal, then glowing darker and darker red.<br/>Razor frowned. “Huh? What’s that?”<br/>Charles’s smirk grew wider.<br/>“Something… that will make you BURNNNN!”<br/>Instantly, a thick, blazing red laser beam shot straight from Charles’s eyes.<br/>Razor reacted fast—he threw up both hands. Aura formed a glowing shield. The beam slammed into it. Sparks flew. The ground shook.<br/>But Charles roared, “UGGGG!” and poured in more power. The beam grew wider, hotter, stronger.<br/>The shield cracked.<br/>Razor’s eyes widened in panic. He knew he couldn’t hold it. Energy draining fast, he tried to flash away—but he was too slow now. Charles had weakened him on purpose.<br/>Too late.<br/>The hellfire beam shattered the shield and struck Razor dead center in the chest.<br/>“YAAAAA!” Razor screamed, voice raw with pain and terror.<br/>The beam burned clean through. Blood exploded outward in a bright red spray—splashing the ground, the walls, his own men.<br/>Skin and flesh melted away in seconds. A massive, smoking hole opened right through his chest—you could see straight through it.<br/>Razor’s body flew backward, arms limp.<br/>THUD.<br/>He hit the ground hard, like dead weight. Eyes wide open. Lifeless.<br/>Dead.<br/>Silence fell over everything.<br/>Only the sickening smell of burned flesh filled the air.</div>
