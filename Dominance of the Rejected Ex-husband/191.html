        <h1>Chapter 191</h1>
        <div><p>“What the hell… who are they?” Serena demanded, her voice shaking as she stared at the wreckage ahead.</p><p>Charles nudged the door open. “Let’s find out.”</p><p>Before she could stop him, he stepped out. Serena hesitated only a second, then opened her own door and followed.</p><p>The bridge was silent except for the hiss of damaged engines. The three vans sat twisted and broken. Several men were down, groaning, unable to move. Three others staggered out, injured but still standing.</p><p>They reached for their guns and aimed it at them. </p><p>Charles moved first.</p><p>He crossed the distance in a blink. His hand snapped up, twisting a wrist. A gun clattered to the ground. </p><p>He pivoted, struck, and wrenched another weapon free before the second man even realized he had lost it.</p><p>The third attacker lunged toward Serena. She reacted fast also. She was also a fighter.</p><p>She stepped in, ducked under his arm, and drove her elbow into his ribs. He gasped, stumbled, and she swept his legs. He hit the ground hard and didn’t get back.</p><p>In a minute. The three were on the floor, writhing from pain. </p><p>Charles picked up one of the fallen guns and turned back toward the remaining men.</p><p>“Now,” he said calmly, his voice flat and cold. “Tell me who sent you.”</p><p>They exchanged looks as they clenched their teeth, saying nothing.</p><p>Charles didn’t repeat himself.</p><p>Boom!. Boom!</p><p>Two sharp shots rang out. The men dropped instantly.</p><p>Serena flinched.</p><p>She turned slowly to look at Charles, shock written all over her face. She had never seen him like this. No hesitation. No emotion. That was cold. </p><p>The last man froze. His knees buckled and he dropped to the ground, hands raised, trembling violently.</p><p>“I will  talk,” he blurted out. “I will talk. Don’t shoot.”</p><p>Charles didn’t lower the gun. “Go on”, he simply said. </p><p>The man swallowed hard. “It’s Collins. Collins sent us.”</p><p>Serena’s breath caught. “Collins?” she repeated, disbelief crashing into anger. “Collins sent you?”</p><p>“Yes,” the man nodded frantically. “He said to take a file from you. He said if things went wrong… we could kill you.”</p><p>The words hung heavy in the air.</p><p>Serena’s hands curled into fists. Her chest burned as rage surged through her.</p><p>She stared at the man on the ground. Collins would go any length just to become the CEO. A position he didn&#x27;t even fit. </p><p>Later that evening, Serena called for a full family meeting.</p><p>The grand room slowly filled. Every major figure of the family sat in silence, tension thick in the air. </p><p>At the head of the room, Mr. Moretti waited, hands folded, his expression barely containing his anticipation. This was exactly what he had hoped for. For Serena to be the one to win. </p><p>Then, the doors opened.</p><p>Serena walked in first, composed and calm. Charles followed just behind her.</p><p>Mr. Moretti broke into a broad smile the moment he saw her.</p><p> “Yes,” he said proudly, leaning forward. “That’s my daughter. I knew you would pull it off.”</p><p>Collins sat in one corner, jaw tight, eyes burning. He already knew. He could feel it. The plan he had set had failed—completely.</p><p>Serena walked straight to her father and placed the signed file in his hands.</p><p>Mr. Moretti opened it, scanning the pages carefully. His eyes lit up.</p><p>“This is it,” he said, nodding. “This is the finalized agreement.”</p><p>He looked up at Serena, satisfaction clear in his voice. “You did it.”</p><p>A murmur rippled through the room…uneasy and unhappy.</p><p>“With this,” Mr. Moretti continued, voice firm, “you will officially head the Avalon Project. As agreed, you will also assume the role of permanent CEO.”</p><p>Serena smiled and bowed.</p><p>Around the table,  everyone frowned. Some looked away. Others clenched their hands in anger. No one clapped for her. </p><p>She didn&#x27;t even care. </p><p>Collins couldn&#x27;t take it and  snapped.</p><p>He slammed both palms on the table and shot to his feet. “No!” he barked. “I can’t accept this.”</p><p>Everyone turned toward him.</p><p>“That partnership was supposed to be mine,” he continued, pointing accusingly at Serena. “I was meant to secure it. But she sabotaged me. She stole my opportunity.”</p><p>The room went silent.</p><p>Serena turned slowly to face him. Her expression was calm, but her eyes were sharp.</p><p>“Sabotaged you?” she repeated. “What do you mean by that?&quot;</p><p>Collins scoffed. “Don’t play innocent. You manipulated your way into this. The COO was about to sign us the documents, when Serena and Charles disrupt everything and lie against us, she made the CEO send us away”</p><p>Charles shifted slightly, his gaze locking onto Collins.</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s brows drew together. As he curiously and anxiously asked. </p><p>“Is that really the truth, Collins?”</p><p>Collins straightened immediately. “I swear on my life,” he said firmly. “They ruined everything for us.”</p><p>He turned sharply toward Tracy. “Right?”</p><p>All eyes shifted on her. </p><p>Tracy hesitated for only a fraction of a second, then nodded. “Yes,” she said quietly. “That’s what happened.”</p><p>A ripple moved through the room.</p><p>Allison leaned forward, lips curling in disdain. “I knew it,” she said. “I knew she would do something like this. Pathetic. Father, She can’t lead this family with this kind of behavior. We won’t tolerate it.”</p><p>Others seized the opening.</p><p>“Yes,” someone added.</p><p>“This is unacceptable.”</p><p>“How could she sabotage Collins and still have the nerve to stand here and present that file?”</p><p>The accusations piled up fast, voices overlapping, feeding off one another.</p><p>Serena stepped forward.</p><p>“He brought it on himself,” she said clearly. “He asked us to leave the company. The CEO, Ms. Sapphire, didn’t tolerate his behavior and sent them away. That decision had nothing to do with me.”</p><p>Mr. Gerald scoffed. “Stop twisting things,” he snapped. “You are full of spite. You have no capacity to lead. You will never be CEO.”</p><p>Serena let out a short, humorless laugh.</p><p>“So you think an abettor killer is better suited?” she said coolly. She raised her hand and pointed straight at Collins.</p><p></p></div>
