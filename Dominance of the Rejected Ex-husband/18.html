        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div>After the divorce papers were signed, Charles stepped out and inhaled the fresh air of a new life.<br/>Even if that new life felt bleak…he had nowhere to sleep in two days, but at least he had finally escaped Tracy’s emotional manipulation.<br/>Just then, Tracy appeared, Derek at her side. She stared at Charles for a long moment, her expression torn. <br/>She looked like she wanted to cry but couldn’t, not with Derek around. Showing weakness was out of the question.<br/>She sneered.<br/> “Are you finally okay now? I tried to keep our marriage together, but you were so keen on breaking it. Are you happy now? Ugh.”<br/>Charles’s voice was calm, cold.<br/> “Your delusions and gaslighting are at their peak. I’m the one who ended the marriage, not you. And you brought your lover to the divorce? Tracy… I regret ever meeting you.”<br/>Tracy sniffled.<br/> “Well, I know one day you’ll come back. Sooner or later, you’ll need my help. Because lowlifes like you always do. But I won’t help you.”<br/>“I would rather drown than ask for your help. We’re done here. I’m leaving.” He turned and began walking away.<br/>“CHARLES! You’ll regret this, I swear! You pathetic, lowlife man!” Tracy shouted from behind.<br/>He ignored her. Rage-baiting had no effect on him. His stomach growled, reminding him his little money had to last for food, so he decided to walk home.<br/>As he wandered through the streets, a sleek car suddenly stopped in front of him. Three men in black stepped out.<br/>Before he could react, they bowed deeply, heads nearly touching the ground. Charles checked behind him, certain they were bowing to someone else...but it was him.<br/>The man in the middle stepped forward and handed him a gold, shiny card.<br/>“Mr. Charles. The Godfather requests your presence tonight. Please ensure you arrive.”<br/>Before he could speak, the men returned to their car and sped away. <br/>Charles stood frozen, mind racing. Why such respect for him? Who were these men, and who was the Godfather?.<br/>He spent the day trying to figure it out, researching the gold card. It was from The Grand Royal Hotel...Room 0001.<br/>The Grand Royal was the country’s top hotel, a place for men of power. Not just anyone could enter; it was exorbitantly expensive. Rumor had it Room 0001 was reserved for the president himself. <br/>But why would the president want to see him?.<br/>The hotel’s ownership was unknown also,  Some whispered he was an overseas consortium. And that he was the one that resides in room 0001.<br/>Everything about it was secretive. Who could the Godfather be?.<br/>By 8 p.m., Charles arrived. He froze at the hotel’s towering, glittering facade. His plain clothes stood in stark contrast to the luxury surrounding him. Clutching the card, he stepped inside.<br/>Everything shimmered. He could see his reflection on the polished floor. Hesitantly, he approached the receptionist.<br/>“Who are you? This isn’t a place for… people like you. Leave.”<br/>Charles held out the gold card.<br/>Before the receptionist could respond, a voice rang out.<br/> “Welcome, our highly esteemed guest!” The doorman’s greeting echoed through the lobby.<br/>Charles turned and froze. Tracy and Derek were already there, booking a room. His lips curled into a scoff.<br/>Tracy’s eyes widened. “Charles? What the hell are you doing here? Did you think you could just walk in? You can’t even afford this hotel! Didn’t you do your research before showing up?”.<br/>Charles said nothing. He hadn’t come to cause a scene...he was here for someone important.<br/>Tracy stepped closer, suspicion and irritation in her voice. “Wait… are you following me? Like… Do you want to apologize? Look, I told you…you are pathetic. And you are already regretting.”<br/>Charles finally spoke, voice sharp. “Stop spewing nonsense. I’m not here for you.”<br/>Derek crossed his arms. “So… you are here for what, exactly? Don’t embarrass yourself. Or they will throw you out.”<br/>Charles’s eyes flicked toward him, dangerous. “You’re the one who should shut up. Just book your room and go fuck yourself.”<br/>Tracy’s face flushed red with anger. “Ugh! Are you… jealous now? I’m over you too, Charles! And I’m with Derek! He’s a capable man...far better than you!”<br/>Then the receptionist cautioned them, “please. No room for shouting here, or else we will throw you out”.<br/>This was the Grand High Hotel, and they didn’t care about anyone’s status. Tracy seethed at Charles and snapped, “Good luck dragging yourself through embarrassment.”<br/>She then booked her room, collected her keycard, and headed for the exclusive elevator. But the two bodyguards stationed at the entrance immediately blocked her path.<br/>“Sorry, ma’am. Take the regular elevator. This one is only for the special VIP guest we are expecting today, ” they said.<br/>Tracy’s face burned with indignation. “I am the CEO of Vortex Consortium! and I booked a high class room, how dare you deny me the VIP elevator?”.<br/>“We are sorry, ma’am. That’s just what we are instructed. Only our important guests may use this elevator today,” one of them replied firmly.<br/>Tracy’s anger flared. She hated having her pride trampled. Just then, Charles stepped forward.<br/>The two bodyguards immediately recognized him, he was one of the men of yesterday.<br/>“Welcome, Mr. Charles. We have been expecting you. Sorry if you had any trouble,” they said, stepping aside respectfully.<br/>Tracy’s jaw dropped. She couldn’t believe what was happening. “Wait… wait… you are mistaken!, is he the VIP you are talking about?”.</div>
