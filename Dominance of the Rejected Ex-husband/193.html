        <h1>Chapter 193</h1>
        <div><p>Collins stared at his father like the room had tilted. For a second he didn’t move. Then his knees gave way. He dropped to the floor with a hollow thud.</p><p>“Father… please.” His voice cracked as he grabbed Mr. Moretti’s trouser leg. “Forgive me. I know I did something stupid. I shouldn’t have… I shouldn’t have done that. Please don’t send me away.”</p><p>He was seriously crying which made him  look so pathetic.</p><p>Mr. Moretti looked down at him, his face unreadable. Then he told him,  “That decision is no longer mine. It belongs to Serena. She is the one you offended.”</p><p>All eyes turned to her.</p><p>Serena stood on her ground.  “No,” she said simply. “I won’t.”</p><p>A ripple of shock passed through the room.</p><p>Mr. Moretti straightened. His voice hardened. “Then that is final. From today onward, you are no longer a member of this family.” He paused. “I disown you.”</p><p>The words hit like a blow.</p><p>Murmurs erupted at once.</p><p>“Did he really mean that?”</p><p> “What?”</p><p> “His own son?”</p><p>Allison covered her mouth. Others stared in disbelief.</p><p>Serena only scoffed.</p><p>So now they care, she thought. When she was sent away because of Charles’ misunderstanding no one protested. No one begged. They even celebrated it.</p><p>Collins remained on his knees for a moment longer. Then he seemed to understand that no matter how much he pleaded. It&#x27;s of no use. </p><p>His face twisted. The pleading drained away and something darker took its place.</p><p>“Father,” he said coldly. “You are sending me away. Fine.” He laughed once and sharply stated. “I swear you will regret this.”</p><p>The room froze.</p><p>Gasps followed.</p><p>“He’s threatening Mr. Moretti?”</p><p> “Has he lost his mind?”</p><p>Mr. Moretti scoffed. “Really?”</p><p>“I swear,” Collins snapped. “You always loved Serena more than anyone. And today you proved it. I will make you regret this.”</p><p>He turned abruptly and faced Tracy. She sat stiffly, pale and trembling like a wet bird caught in the rain.</p><p>“Let’s go,” Collins said.</p><p>Tracy gulped. She stood slowly and lowered her head. Without a word, she followed him.</p><p>Collins stormed out of the grand room.Tracy trailed behind him, walking out in silence and shame.</p><p>The doors slammed shut. No one spoke for some moment.</p><p>Mr. Moretti remained standing there, his shoulders heavy, sadness settling into him as the weight of what had just happened sank in, because as the head of the family he felt he had failed to keep peace among his children.</p><p>yet deep down he knew Collins had brought this on himself, his recklessness and cruelty had gone on for too long and he had ignored it again and again, but not this time, not when blood had almost been spilled.</p><p>His thoughts drifted briefly to Serena, to how he had once sent her away because of a misunderstanding, and now he knew he could not afford to be biased again or treat situations differently just because of guilt or affection.</p><p>He sighed and finally broke the silence.</p><p>“I am making this official,” he said slowly. “I will no longer be the head of this family.”</p><p>The room stirred.</p><p>“From today onward, Serena will take that position,” he continued. “She will also remain the permanent CEO.”</p><p>Murmurs spread instantly.</p><p> “That’s unbelievable.” </p><p>“He’s stepping down?”</p><p>Mr. Moretti raised his hand slightly. “I have been feeling weak lately,” he admitted. “I will only advise Serena from time to time, but all authority and commands will come from her.”</p><p>He paused, then added firmly, “This will be documented and signed at the next board meeting, so arrange it three days from now. That is final.”</p><p>With that, he turned and walked inside, leaving the room behind him.</p><p>No one moved.</p><p>They all stared at Serena, shock written plainly on their faces, irritation and anger simmering beneath it.</p><p>She didn’t care.</p><p>Allison scoffed. “You are already lifting your shoulders,” she said sharply. “You think you’re above everyone now?”</p><p>Serena looked at her calmly. “You heard father,” she replied. “I genuinely hope we can work together for the progress of this family and the company.”</p><p>She bowed lightly. “Thank you all for your continued support.”</p><p>The politeness only irritated them more.</p><p>Mr. Gerald snorted. “Eye service,” he muttered. “Acting all shiny.”</p><p>Serena didn’t respond. She simply turned and walked out of the room.</p><p>Charles followed after her, dragging the injured man along with him.</p><p>Outside, Charles loosened his grip and let the injured man go since they didn&#x27;t want the police involved, and the man didn’t wait, he scrambled to his feet and ran off like his life depended on it.</p><p>Serena turned to Charles at once, the strength finally leaving her shoulders.</p><p>“Finally,” she said quietly, her voice trembling despite herself, “we did it.”</p><p>Charles smiled, a tired but genuine smile. “Yeah,” he replied, “finally.”</p><p>She stepped forward and hugged him tightly, holding him like she was afraid he might disappear, pressing herself against him as if anchoring her heart to his, and Charles didn’t pull away, he wrapped his arms around her and stayed there, breathing her in, and enjoying the softness of her breast.</p><p>They stayed like that longer than either of them realized.</p><p>When she finally pulled back, her eyes were glossy.</p><p>“After three days,” she said softly, “when the documents are signed and everything is settled, we will end the engagement.”</p><p>Charles stiffened slightly but said nothing.</p><p>Serena looked away.  she added, forcing steadiness.  because somewhere along the line she had started falling for him, and loving him so much, even though she believed they could never truly be together since Charles got many women in his life. </p><p>She hesitated, then spoke again. “When I officially become CEO,” she said, “can you fuck me?”</p><p>Charles swallowed. “uhn?”</p><p>“i have wanted to be fucked by you”,  she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper, “But you always ignore me. can you please do me the favour then”</p><p>Charles didn’t answer immediately. His throat tightened as he nodded slowly, “Sure… I will do that”.</p><p>Meanwhile, in one dark corner, someone was making a call. </p><p>“Hey, I need you to kill someone for me before three days!”</p><p></p></div>
