        <h1>Chapter 151</h1>
        <div>They were all shocked as they opened the comment section. It contained many vile, hateful and extreme comments. <br/>“Lazy old man. At his age he should be working, not begging.”<br/>“Imagine kneeling for money. No dignity.”<br/>“Men like this are the reason society is rotten.”<br/>“Why didn’t he die quietly instead of embarrassing himself.”<br/>Tina’s hand flew to her mouth. Her eyes shimmered and then the tears spilled. “This is our fault,” she cried. “He knelt because of us. Because of me.”<br/>Amara’s lips trembled. “If you didn't  stop to save us yesterday none of this would have happened.”<br/>Charles exhaled slowly and scoffed. “Enough. It’s nothing. This isn't your fault and this… is nothing, it won't do me any damage”<br/>Sapphire turned to him sharply. “How can you say that? Your face is everywhere. Millions of people have seen this. They think you’re a beggar.”<br/>He shrugged. “Let them think whatever they want. I did what I had to do.”<br/>“How could you say that's nothing,” she said quietly.<br/>He met her eyes without flinching. “I’m not ashamed.”<br/>He turned away and started packing his things, preparing to leave. Tina sobbed harder. Amara wiped her face again and again.<br/>Charles checked his phone.<br/>Forty missed calls.<br/>Some from Tracy, Natasha, Lizzypie and Serena. Many from Serena that she even sent a message.<br/>[Where are you? What is this video about? Why aren't you picking up].<br/>The video has truly already gone viral.<br/>He locked the phone without replying and slipped it into his pocket.<br/>When he was done, he slung his bag over his shoulder. “I’ll be on my way.”<br/>Tina rushed forward and hugged him tight. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”<br/>Amara joined her, arms wrapping around his waist. “Please forgive us.”<br/>He patted their backs. “I said it's fine, not your fault”<br/>Sapphire stepped closer and hugged him too.<br/>His breath paused..<br/>Her big breast pressed against him and her warmth seeped through his shirt. He could feel the warmth and wanted them to stay like that.<br/>Then, they exchanged contacts, and escorted him out. <br/>At that moment, three cars suddenly appeared.<br/>Zoom.<br/>Zoom.<br/>Zoom.<br/>The cars screeched in at once and cut across the street, until he arrived in front of them, and stopped. <br/>Doors flew open and some men stepped out. Dressed in Suits. They looked sturdy, and muscular. <br/>Just then one man stepped forward.<br/>He wasn’t as sturdy as the others. His shoulders were lean and his posture relaxed. But the way the others subtly shifted someone could tell he was the leader.<br/>Seeing him, Sapphire instinctively moved back. She hid behind Charles without thinking. Tina and Amara did the same, clutching his shirt.<br/>The man scoffed lightly.<br/>“Hey Sapphire.”<br/>His voice was calm, almost bored.<br/>“We don’t have time for games. You know this already. Mr Damien wants you. Right now. And you’re coming with us.”<br/>Sapphire didn’t answer.<br/>Jasmine tilted his head. “We talked about this before. Don’t make us keep going in circles. Mr Damien is ready to change your life. You know he loves you.”<br/>Sapphire slowly stepped out from behind Charles. Her hands were shaking but her voice wasn’t.<br/>“But I don’t love him,” she said. “He already has three wives. Please tell him I’m not interested.”<br/>Jasmine laughed under his breath. “You’re special. Unlike the others. You have something to offer. Your intelligence. Your innovation. And you are so beautiful. You deserve a better life.”<br/>“That’s exactly why Mr Damien isn’t for me,” Sapphire replied. “I won’t throw away my standards because of power.”<br/>Charles glanced at her and nodded slightly. He was impressed. Sapphire wasn't only pretty but also brave.<br/>But this made Jasmine lose it. <br/>“Someone?” he repeated coldly. “You just called the almighty Mr Damien someone?”<br/>His eyes hardened.<br/>“Looks like you don’t want this done gently. That copy code AI you created. Mr Damien will take it. And he will take you too. Whether you like it or not.”<br/>He took a step closer.<br/>“If you don’t follow us willingly, we will use force.”<br/>Jasmine’s lips curled as he made a subtle nod.<br/>Two of the men stepped forward at once, hands reaching for Sapphire.<br/>Before they could touch her, a voiced shrieked at them. <br/>“She isn’t interested in Damien.”<br/>Everyone froze as Charles had stepped forward.<br/>Jasmine turned slowly, eyes narrowing. “Uhn?” He looked Charles up and down. “And who the hell are you?”<br/>He sneered. “If you don’t want to see Mr Damien’s wrath, step aside now and stop poking your nose in a business that isn’t yours.”<br/>Charles didn’t move.<br/>“Well,” he said calmly, “it is my business.”<br/>Jasmine scoffed. “Young man, how exactly is this your business? Are you family?”<br/>Charles hesitated for half a second, “uhn….”. <br/>Before he could answer, Sapphire chimed in. <br/>“My fiancée.”<br/>Then, she wrapped her arms around Charles from behind and held him tight.<br/>Charles stiffened in shock. Her breast pressed against his back, warm and firm.  He gulped. <br/>He understood instantly why she did it. She needed an escape. She needed Damien to back off.<br/>Jasmine stared at them, then laughed. “Stop joking.”<br/>Charles stepped forward, gently loosening Sapphire’s arms but staying close.<br/>“She’s my fiancée,” he said firmly. “And she isn’t following you anywhere.”<br/>Jasmine burst into laughter.<br/>“Oh no,” he said, clapping slowly. “This is your fiancée?”<br/>His eyes dragged over Sapphire then back to Charles. “You are obviously older than him. Don’t disappoint me like this. You can do more than that”. <br/>He tilted his head. “Or is it because he is rich?”<br/>The laughter died as Jasmine faced Charles properly this time. He stepped closer and studied his face with sudden focus.<br/>“Who the hell are you? Who is your father”<br/>Charles didn’t answer him. <br/>That silence irritated Jasmine.<br/>He squinted. Took another step forward. Then another. And gazed at him very well.<br/>He leaned in, before popping out his eyes in shock. <br/>“…I’ve seen you before.”<br/>He moved even closer and stared hard at Charles’ face.<br/>“What the fuck,” Jasmine muttered. “It’s you.”<br/>He straightened and laughed again, louder this time. “You are the beggar.”<br/>Charles stood calmly.<br/>“The one going viral,” Jasmine continued. “The man who went on his knees and begged Young Master Paul. Mr Damien’s son himself.”<br/>He chuckled. “Asking a kid for money. Pathetic.”</div>
