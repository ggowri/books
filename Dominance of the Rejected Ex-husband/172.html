        <h1>Chapter 172</h1>
        <div>Meanwhile, in an unpopular seaport in Winchester stood a warehouse.<br/>It contained 1,000 tins of gold, billions of dollars in cash, 20,000 hard drugs, and many pieces of jewellery and properties.<br/> If someone converted all of it into money and spent one million dollars per day, he would not finish it even after one hundred years.<br/>That was how striking Mr. Damien had amassed his wealth.<br/>Inside the spacious warehouse were about 500 men. Some were moving items while many stood on high alert with guns. The man monitoring them was Razor, the Asian assassin who had never lost a duel.<br/>He sat there, watching everyone with his scrutinizing eyes. Just then, the door opened and two men rushed toward him.<br/>“Sir… sir… we saw about thirty cars approaching this place, and we could see guns coming out from the cars,” one of them reported.<br/>Razor immediately stood up. Instantly, everyone stopped working and picked up their guns.<br/>“Disguise everything here as we always do. And shoot as soon as I give the order!” he shouted.<br/>“Yes, sir,” they yelled back.<br/>With that, every one of them dashed out, with Razor leading the way.<br/>Actually, Razor was not scared at all. He believed there was no one who could face him. Besides, Mr. Damien owned this city. No one in their right mind would dare go against him.<br/>As they stepped outside, it was just as the man had said. There were about fifty cars, with guns clearly visible. They had stopped right in front of the warehouse.<br/>The 500 men pointed their guns at them, waiting for Razor’s command to shoot. He remained calm.<br/>Then the doors began to open, and Zander and Reaper rushed out first.<br/>They raised their guns, and soon all the car doors opened as well. The thugs dashed out and pointed their guns back at Mr. Damien’s men. There were about 200 of them, so they were outnumbered.<br/>Razor scoffed and said calmly, “Who are you people? Did Mr. Damien send you here?”<br/>The thugs suddenly split into two, and a figure appeared.<br/>“I sent them here.”<br/>It was Charles. He walked out with great composure and calmness, his eyes glued directly on Razor.<br/>Razor squeezed his face as he instantly recognized him. He could not help but smirk.<br/>“Isn’t that the coward I beat to a pulp the other day? You ran away. What the hell are you doing here with these cockroaches behind you?”<br/>Charles felt a little embarrassed, but he did not let it show.  He said, “Well, that’s one of the reasons I’m back.”<br/>Razor laughed and replied, “Even if we face each other a hundred times, you can never defeat me. I know you have some special power like me, but you can never match me.”<br/>Charles said calmly, “Well, we will see about that soon. Anyway, we are here to stop and put a seizure on Mr. Damien’s madness. This warehouse contains many illegal dealings of his. We are here to seize everything and report it to the police.”<br/>Razor turned to face his men and laughed. They all laughed with him.<br/>He said, “Wow. I can see you’re really sick. You don’t even know what you’re doing. You came here to seize Mr. Damien’s property? Who gave you such effrontery?”<br/>Charles said, “I’m really here to do exactly that.”<br/>Razor scoffed. “Stop dreaming. Aside from the fact that I can kill all the men you brought with you, how will your 200 thugs face my 500 men? They are well trained, and some of them are retired soldiers.”<br/>Charles gulped, scared, but he did not back down “Is that what you think? That only you can defeat my men?”<br/>Razor replied, “Yes. I have done more than this.”<br/>Reaper and Zander were already getting scared. They had also heard stories about Razor in the underworld.<br/>Charles said, “Stop bluffing. You can’t even take me on.”<br/>He provoked him intentionally.<br/>Razor folded his arms, “You are the one bluffing. I will eat you up this time. Kill you right in front of your men”<br/>Then Charles said, “Why don’t we stop talking and settle this with a duel? One on one. No one interferes.”<br/>Razor could not help but laugh.<br/>“You really wish to die by my hand,” he said. “This time, I will not hold back.”<br/>Charles replied, “If you manage to kill me, my men will back down immediately. So take the easy route, then.”<br/>Razor turned to his men and said, “Guys, it seems you won’t be doing any hard work today. Let me deal with him real quick.”<br/>He faced Charles again. “I accept the challenge. One-on-one duel. My men and yours won’t interfere.”<br/>Charles nodded instantly.<br/>They all stepped back and formed a wide circle, large enough for the fight. The tension thickened.<br/>Reaper leaned close to Charles and whispered, deeply concerned, “Boss… I don’t think you can take him alone. Please call the Godfather. He once took down an entire gang by himself—the infamous Jazz Gang. He killed them all in one night.”<br/>Charles gulped. His only hope was that his new upgrade would be enough to defeat Razor.<br/>“I’ll be okay,” he said quietly.<br/>He turned to Razor. Razor turned to him.<br/>“Fight! Fight! Fight!” Razor’s men began to chant loudly.<br/>With that, the duel began. <br/>Razor did not waste a second. He rolled his fist forward, and a magical aura streamed out of it—the same power that had nearly killed Charles before.<br/>Charles swallowed hard, then closed his eyes and took a deep breath.<br/>(EYES OF SATAN, ACTIVATED)</div>
