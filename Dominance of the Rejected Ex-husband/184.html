        <h1>Chapter 184</h1>
        <div><p>Seeing them, Serena’s chest tightened.</p><p>For a brief second, everything inside her sank. She didn&#x27;t expect to collide with collins. That was the essence of coming here quickly. Yet,  here he was. </p><p> She didn’t want a confrontation. So she turned slightly, intending to walk away and avoid the drama.</p><p>“Uh… sister.”</p><p>Collins’ voice followed immediately.</p><p>“Are you shy to see me?”</p><p>Serena stopped.</p><p>Before she could move again, Collins strode forward and deliberately cut across their path, blocking them. His smile widened as his eyes swept over her.</p><p>“Wow,” he said mockingly. “I thought you were acting like I didn’t concern you. But here you are the very next day. That reeks of desperation.”</p><p>Then his gaze shifted to Charles, his expression turning ugly.</p><p>“And you even brought along this dirty trash. More reason you can never get the partnership”</p><p>Charles didn’t react. He simply stood there, calm and unreadable.</p><p>Serena’s patience snapped. “Why can’t you just shut up and stop acting foolish?” she said coldly. “And what about you? What are you doing here also?”</p><p>Collins chuckled, clearly enjoying himself. “Me? I’m just here to tighten a few things up.”</p><p>He leaned in slightly, lowering his voice with confidence. “I have already secured the partnership.”</p><p>Serena froze.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she stared at him, disbelief washing over her face.</p><p>Already… secured it?</p><p>Serena’s mind reeled.</p><p>So fast?</p><p>Did Collins come here right after that night? That was the only explanation that made sense.</p><p>She looked at him sharply. “What the hell do you mean you already got the partnership?”</p><p>Collins’ smile widened. He was clearly enjoying the look on her face. “Look at you,” he said smugly. “You are scared.”</p><p>He stepped closer and continued, “Let me tell you something. I already have it secured. Maybe it’s not officially signed yet, but with the help of this—” he tightened his arm around Tracy, “—my beautiful, wonderful love of my life, my everything, she made it happen.”</p><p>He pulled Tracy closer and pecked her confidently.</p><p>Charles scoffed under his breath.</p><p>Serena frowned, confusion written all over her face.</p><p>Tracy lifted her chin and smiled. “Let me make it clear,” she said calmly. “The COO of Aurelia Dynamics is the one who handles partnerships. Evaluations. Final recommendations. He only reports back to Ms. Sapphire, the CEO.”</p><p>Tracy continued, her tone almost casual. “That COO happens to be engaged to one of my close friends. So she spoke to him on our behalf. He already agreed.”</p><p>She smiled wider. “In fact, he called Collins this morning. That’s why we are here early. For the official documents.”</p><p>The words hit Serena one after another, heavy and crushing.</p><p>Serena stood rooted to the spot.</p><p>Watching how luck, timing, and people all aligned for Collins—and against her—made her chest feel hollow. From what Tracy had just said, if the COO was already on their side, then it was over.</p><p>Collins had won.</p><p>He lifted his chin arrogantly. “Do you really think you can beat me? I’m your older brother. Learn to respect that. I will always be ahead of you.”</p><p>Tracy smiled, clearly enjoying the moment. “I’m sure you are shocked. Not only does Collins have a solid proposal, but the COO is on our side too. So just turn around and leave.”</p><p>The words crushed Serena.</p><p>Then Tracy turned to Charles, her eyes sharp. “And you,” she said coldly. “A gold digger. You really thought you could help her win the CEO position so you could benefit from her forever?”</p><p>She laughed lightly. “You are foolish. Even if she somehow became CEO, she would dump you. She’s only using you. And secondly, she will never become the Moretti CEO anyway. So you picked the wrong side.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “You should have come back when I told you to.”</p><p>“You told him to come back?” collins asked, frowning.</p><p>Tracy froze for half a second, then laughed nervously. “Oh no, baby. That was before I met you. He refused because he wanted sex and money. But now that I’m with you, I don’t care about him at all. I only love you.”</p><p>Collins smiled at it.</p><p>Charles stared at her, stunned.</p><p>He couldn’t fathom how Tracy could be so two-faced. Gentle and saint-like when they were alone, yet arrogant and cruel in public, willing to humiliate him without hesitation.</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>Instead, he turned to Serena, his voice calm. “Let’s just go in.”</p><p>Collins laughed sharply. “Go where? You mean after everything we just said, you still want to go in?”</p><p>Charles scoffed. “So? How does that concern you?”</p><p>“Don’t you understand what I told you moments ago?” Collins snapped. “I have already been awarded the partnership. The COO will hand it to me.”</p><p>Truthfully, if Serena were alone, she would have already turned back. There was no point going in anymore. But she knew Charles wouldn’t agree to that.</p><p>“As I said,” Charles replied calmly, “we don’t care. We will do what we came here for!!!.”</p><p>Collins’ face darkened. “Why are you being so stupid? You are going to cause misunderstandings and embarrass the Moretti family. The partnership will be led and signed by me. Just leave now and don’t cause a scene.”</p><p>Charles tilted his head slightly. “So it’s because you know the COO that you are acting so arrogant and so sure?”</p><p>He paused, then said evenly, “Then let me tell you something.”</p><p>“I know the CEO herself.”</p><p>Everyone raised their head to what he said. </p><p></p></div>
