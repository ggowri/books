        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div>Tracy sat in the car, exhausted and parched, the dust in the air making her extremely uncomfortable. She coughed incessantly, never feeling so disheveled before, yet at the same time, she felt broken. <br/>She wanted to wait, to look for Charles, but there were some journalists outside taking photos and documenting the fire, and she was worried they would recognize her.<br/>She was a well-known CEO, and she feared that people might take pictures or ask why she was there...questions that would force her to reveal her relationship with Charles, something she wasn’t ready to expose.<br/>“Charles… What are you seriously pulling? Ugh, you better come out now,” she muttered, still scanning the area from her vehicle.<br/>She didn’t notice when a tear fell from her eye. She sniffled quickly and wiped it away.<br/>“What the hell’s wrong with me? The debris must have gotten in my eyes,” she said, rubbing at them, though she could hear her heart pounding fiercely in her chest.<br/>A moment ago, she had pulled back a white cloth to check if Charles was among the bodies. That memory made her chest tighten, a mix of fear and dread crawling through her.<br/>“Charles… are you really dead? No…that can’t happen …” she whispered to herself, nodding repeatedly as if trying to force the thought from her mind.<br/>Just then, her phone buzzed. Ringing.<br/>Charles?<br/>Her heart leapt as she grabbed the phone and checked the screen...only to see Derek. Her expression shifted immediately.<br/>“Why is it him?!” she snarled, unsure whether to answer. She worried that if she hesitated, Charles might appear, and she would miss him.<br/>What she didn’t know was that she had lost him forever...or perhaps, she was just refusing to admit it.<br/>The phone wouldn’t stop ringing. Anger flared, and she had no choice but to pick it up, ready to shout.<br/>“Hello, babe,” Derek’s voice came through. For some reason, it didn’t make her feel as good as it usually did.<br/>“Hello, babe,” she replied softly.<br/>“I’ve been trying to reach you since this morning. You’ve been a bit unavailable. Are you that busy?” Derek asked.<br/>She sniffled before answering, “Yeah… just a little busy. I got caught up in something.”<br/>“Oh, I’m sorry for disturbing you. I just missed you, and Francis missed you too...that’s why we called,” Derek said, his voice warm and gentle.<br/>Then a little voice piped up, “Mum! Where are you? Daddy and I are waiting. We bought a special meal, and I want us to eat it together!” Francis whined.<br/>She sighed and glanced around, worried that he might see Charles. Yet there was no sign of him. <br/>She smiled and replied,<br/>“I’m sorry, my baby boy. I’m so sorry. Have your meal first, I’m on my way right now.”<br/>Francis sighed disappointedly,”Mommy…”<br/>She forced a warm, loving goodbye. “I will be home soon, wait for me,” she said softly. After a brief pause, she hung up, her heart still hammering.<br/>Tracy glanced around once more, but there was still no sign of Charles. A low, frustrated growl escaped her.<br/> “ Look at you… why do you even have to do this work and risk your life like this”.<br/>She quickly dialed Mr. Zoe. “Pull the full list of casualties from the fire. Check if Charles is there,” she ordered, her voice sharp.<br/>“What? Did something happen?” Mr. Zoe asked, alarmed.<br/>“Just do as I said. Give me feedback as soon as possible,” she snapped, then hung up. She started the car, then hesitated for a second. <br/>Just now, for some reason, her heart had pounded fiercely, as if someone’s gaze had fallen on her, and if she left, she would lose something forever.<br/>Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from Derek: Francis refuses to eat and keeps crying. He insists on waiting for you.<br/>A small, tired smile curved her lips. She didn’t want to keep Derek and Francis waiting. Staying here made no sense; she had already instructed Mr. Zoe to investigate and had searched through the debris. Charles must still be alive. <br/>And if there was any news, Mr. Zoe would tell her right away.<br/>Pressing the pedal, she drove off, leaving the chaos behind her.<br/>Meanwhile, From afar. Charles had been watching her. He could see her smile as she drove away. <br/>That's probably Derek and Francis. He knew. She had pulled up some moments ago, looking like she was worried and scared. Charles had been even forming some imagination in his head. <br/>Just for her to leave without even knowing If he died or not. <br/>At that moment,  John saw the car driving away. John knew Tracy. And he immediately recognized the car.<br/>“Wait, isn't that your wife? She must have been worried that she came here. Why is she leaving you?. without seeing you”.<br/>He scoffed it off and said, “No, that isn't her. That's what I thought at first, but that's not her car. It's someone else".  He said.<br/>An announcement crackled over the radios: the rescue was finally over. No one remained inside the building. Everything had been done. Team 6 and the others had completed their work, while the nurses and medics focused on saving the living. <br/>Relief rippled through the crowd. They were so happy.<br/>John let out a long breath. “Wow… I can finally go home. I have missed my wife. You must have missed yours too,” he said, turning toward Charles.<br/>Charles merely scoffed and nodded. He looked around at everyone celebrating, happy to finally return to their families and loved ones.<br/> But there he was alone. No wife, no home. The only wealth he had was the payment they would hand him for his services.</div>
