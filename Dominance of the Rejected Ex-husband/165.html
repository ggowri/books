        <h1>Chapter 165</h1>
        <div><p>They barely made it back to the hotel.</p><p>Charles stumbled through the corridor, he leaned heavily on Lizzypie and Charles as they dragged him. Every step sent a sharp throb through his bones. His vision swam and the carpet blurred beneath his feet. He was really beaten mercilessly. </p><p>Lizzypie kicked the door open and they dragged him inside.</p><p>The moment the door shut, his legs gave out.</p><p>They hauled him into the bedroom and laid him flat on the bed. Charles groaned low. Pain pulsed everywhere, deep and heavy, like his bones had been struck with iron.</p><p>Lizzypie did not waste time. She pulled off his coat, then his shirt.</p><p>Purple bruises spread across his chest and ribs. Some were already dark. Others were swelling fast.</p><p>Sapphire sucked in a breath.</p><p>Her hands trembled as she stared at him. “I caused this,” she said, her voice cracking. “I caused all of this.”</p><p>Tears slid down her cheeks and dropped onto the sheets.</p><p>Lizzypie shot her a sharp look. “Do you want to cry,” she said, “or assist me here.”</p><p>Sapphire sniffled hard. She wiped her face with her sleeve and nodded, keeping her mouth shut as she moved closer.</p><p>Charles shifted and let out a strained groan. His bones ached in a way he had never felt before. </p><p>The assassin’s punches had gone straight through him, like cannon fire wrapped in flesh.</p><p>Lizzypie pushed his pants down enough to check his legs, her hands quick and precise. More bruises. One knee is already swollen.</p><p>“Tch,” she muttered.</p><p>She straightened and turned away, moving to the corner of the room. She opened a small case Sapphire had not seen before and pulled out several wrapped bundles of herbs, dried roots, leaves and powdered bark.</p><p>Sapphire watched silently as Lizzypie worked. She moved in practiced motions, lighting a small burner, crushing herbs with a stone, measuring without hesitation. It was like she had done this a hundred times before.</p><p>Sapphire frowned through her tears. How did she even have all of this here?</p><p>The smell of bitter herbs filled the room as Lizzypie brewed the mixture. She poured it into a cup and brought it back to the bed.</p><p>Charles was barely conscious now, eyes half open, breath shallow.</p><p>Lizzypie lifted his head and pressed the cup to his lips. “Drink,” she said firmly.</p><p>He swallowed with difficulty.</p><p>The moment the tonic went down, warmth spread through his body. The pain dulled, not gone, but pushed far away.</p><p>Within seconds, he slipped into a deep sleep.</p><p>Lizzypie watched him closely, fingers on his wrist, eyes sharp. After a long moment, she nodded.</p><p>“He will be okay, ” she said. “He just needs rest.”</p><p>Sapphire let out a shaky breath and slumped into the chair beside the bed. She stayed close, watching Charles’s chest rise and fall.</p><p>Lizzypie wiped her hands and stood. “I have somewhere else to be.”</p><p>Sapphire looked up quickly. “You are leaving?”</p><p>“I won’t be long,” Lizzypie said. “But he will be out for a while, call me if anything strange happens.”</p><p>Sapphire nodded. “Okay. I will look after him.”</p><p>She hesitated, then bowed her head slightly. “Thank you. And… I’m sorry. For everything.”</p><p>Lizzypie paused at the door and glanced back. Her expression softened just a little.</p><p>“Don’t blame yourself,” she said. “Charles facing Mr. Damien has nothing to do with you.”</p><p>Sapphire frowned. “He followed back to Winchester which caused all this”</p><p>“He has his own mission,” Lizzypie cut in. “He wanted to kill Mr. Damien even before he knew you, that&#x27;s the reason he was in Winchester in the first place ”</p><p>Sapphire looked lost, confusion mixing with guilt.</p><p>“He will explain when he wakes up,” Lizzypie said.</p><p>She opened the door. “Take care of him.”</p><p>With that, she left.</p><p>The room fell quiet.</p><p>Sapphire sat beside the bed, eyes fixed on Charles’s bruised face, listening to his steady breathing, waiting for him to wake.</p><p>Hours passed.</p><p>Sapphire had fallen asleep sitting beside the bed, her head resting near Charles’s arm. Her eyes snapped open when he groaned.</p><p>“Ughh…”</p><p>She jolted upright. “Gentle, gentle,” she said quickly, her hands hovering. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Charles pushed himself up. Too easily.</p><p>Sapphire froze. She stared as he swung his legs off the bed and stood like nothing had happened.  No pain in his face.</p><p>She reached for his chest, then his arms, then his ribs. Her fingers traced where the bruises had been. Where the swelling had risen and there was nothing.</p><p>Her breath caught. “They are gone.&quot;</p><p>“Wow,” she whispered. “How was Lizzypie able to do this? You were screaming of pain some moment ago”</p><p>Charles scoffed and replied. “She has ancient medical knowledge,” Charles said. “Stuff that works like magic”</p><p>Sapphire’s eyes softened. Relief flooded her face and before she could stop herself, she leaned forward and hugged him.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” she said quietly.</p><p>Her breast pressed against his and Charles stiffened for half a second, then relaxed. He placed a hand on her back.</p><p>“It’s okay,” he said.</p><p>She pulled away quickly, embarrassed, then hesitated as questions rushed back into her eyes.</p><p>She looked at him closely. “What was all that?”</p><p>Charles raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“When you were fighting,” she continued, “I could hardly even see you. Both of you were moving so fast. It didn’t feel human. It was naturally impossible to do that.”</p><p>She swallowed. “And that blue thing that came out of his hand. That glowing power.”</p><p>Her voice dropped. “Was that magic?”</p><p>Charles studied her face for a moment. The fear was still there, mixed with awe. Charles exhaled and contemplated what to tell the Sapphire.</p><p>Sapphire added, “Also, why are you trying to kill Mr. Damien,  lizzypie told me you had your own mission!”.</p><p>Charles nodded. Since lizzypie has already given her some heads up, there was no reason to hide things from her. So he decided to tell her everything. </p><p>Everything,  including his power and how it tied to finding a virgin.</p></div>
