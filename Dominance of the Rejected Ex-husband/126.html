        <h1>chapter 126</h1>
        <div>Charles muttered, “What… what are you doing?”<br/>Tracy gave a slow, slutty smirk. “Giving you what you will get every night if we get married.”<br/>“Stop this, Tracy—”<br/>Before he could finish, Tracy yanked his head down and pressed his face into her soft, bare breasts. <br/>They were warm, smooth, the faint sweet smell of her skin filling his nose. During their marriage she never let him touch them freely, not without strict permission . Now she was shoving them at him like a gift.<br/>“Suck me, Charles,” she whispered, voice shaky with need. “Suck my nipples. They are all yours tonight.”<br/>Charles tried to pull back, but her perfume, her heat, the way her hard nipple brushed his lips it was too much.<br/> His cock twitched in his pants. Tracy felt it. Her hand slid down fast, slipped under his trousers and wrapped her hand around his dick. She stroked once, twice. He was already getting hard.<br/>“Good Charles, ” she purred, guiding his mouth to her pink nipple.<br/>Charles gave in. He opened his mouth and sucked it hard.<br/>“Ugh”,  Tracy moaned loud, arching her back, pushing more of her tit into his face. He switched to the other nipple, biting lightly, licking circles. Her hand kept pumping his cock until it was fully hard and leaking.<br/>Tracy pulled away just long enough to shove him onto the wide sofa. She climbed on top, and yanked her dress away, completely naked now. Her pussy was shaved smooth, already wet and shining.<br/>“Fuck me, Charles,” she begged. “I need your cock inside me. Please.”<br/>He grabbed her hips and flipped her onto her back. Tracy spread her legs wide, showing everything. Charles pulled his pants down, his thick cock springing out. He rubbed the head against her wet slit once, twice—then pushed in deep.<br/>“Ahhh fuck!” Tracy screamed, nails digging into his back. “Yes! Harder!”<br/>He started thrusting fast, the sofa creaking under them. Her small tits bounced with every slam. <br/>Charles leaned down, sucked her nipple again while pounding her pussy. Tracy’s legs wrapped around his waist, pulling him deeper.<br/>“More… don’t stop… fuck me however you want!” she cried.<br/>Charles pulled out, flipped her over. Tracy got on all fours, her ass up high. He then shoved his cock back in from behind.<br/>“Oh yeah… Charles, fuck me anyhow”, She screamed into the cushion, pushing her hips back to meet every thrust.<br/>“oh Tracy, ” Charles growled, grabbing her hair.<br/>“I'm all yours! Only yours!” Tracy moaned. “Cum inside me, please!”<br/>He wasn’t done. He pulled her up, carried her to the table with the cake and wine bottles. Swept everything off with one arm crash, then bent her over the table. Tracy’s tits pressed flat against the wood, nipples hard and red from his mouth.<br/>Charles spread her ass cheeks and slid back in. Deep, slow strokes at first, then fast and brutal. Tracy reached back, spreading herself wider.<br/>“Fuck me harder!” she begged, voice breaking.<br/>He grabbed both her wrists, pinned them behind her back, and pounding her very fast. The table shook. Her pussy clenched tight around his cock, soaking wet, making loud sloppy sounds.<br/>“I’m cumming!” Tracy screamed, whole body shaking. Her pussy squeezed him again and again.<br/>Charles kept going, flipped her onto her back on the table. He lifted her legs over his shoulders and slammed in deep. Her tits jiggled wildly. He sucked one nipple hard while thrusting.<br/>“Again… make me cum again!” she cried.<br/>The second orgasm hit her even harder—she squirted a little, wetting his stomach. Then Charles reached his climax.<br/>“Fuck… Tracy…” he groaned, burying himself deep before hastily pulling out  and shooting thick ropes of cum outside her pulsing pussy. <br/>They stayed like that, breathing hard. Cum leaked out of her onto the table. Tracy looked up at him with wet eyes and a satisfied smile.<br/>“See?” she whispered, voice hoarse. “This could be every night… if you marry me again.”<br/>Charles sighed, picked up a white handkerchief from the table, and wiped the sweat and cum off his stomach and cock. He tucked himself back into his trousers, zipped up, and buttoned his shirt without looking at her.<br/>Tracy, still naked, frowned “You’re leaving? Just like that? We just have sex!!!”<br/>Charles didn’t turn around. “Of course. We fucked. That’s all.”<br/>“You can just use me and walk away?” she snapped, sitting up. Her tits jiggled as she shouted. “After everything I gave you tonight?”<br/>Charles finally looked at her, face cold. “You called me here. You asked for it and you got it. This changes nothing, Tracy. I’m not coming back if that's your aim”<br/>He walked to the door and slammed it as he walked out.<br/>Tracy’s voice cracked. “Fuck you, Charles! Fuck you!”<br/>On his way back in the taxi, Charles felt a sting of regret. He blamed himself for giving in to the temptation, but he told himself she got exactly what she asked for.<br/> Still, he knew one thing for sure, he had to keep this from Lizzypie. If she ever found out, she would tear him apart.<br/>He reached the hotel and stepped out of the taxi. Before going inside, he sprayed a bit of cheap perfume he bought from a street vendor to remove the sex scene.<br/>He took a breath, walked up to the room, and opened the door.<br/>He gently stepped in to find the entire room  dark. No lights on. That was strange. Very unlike Lizzypie.<br/>“Lizzy?” he called. “Are you there?”<br/>There was no answer.<br/>He walked forward and flipped the light switch on.<br/>The room lit up. Bright and clear. Charles froze where he stood. His eyes widened for what he just saw.  <br/>Norman was standing behind Lizzypie.<br/>A knife pressed hard against her neck.<br/>She was tied to a steel chair. Her wrists bound. Her ankles are bound. Her mouth taped shut.<br/>Norman smirked. “Any noise,” he said calmly, “and you will find this knife deep in her throat.”</div>
