        <h1>Chapter 78</h1>
        <div><p>Norman approached with a swagger that set Charles’s teeth on edge. </p><p>Yesterday’s ambush flashed through his mind—the thugs Norman had sent, their leader now dead, all while Norman stood here smirking as if it had never happened.</p><p>“What are you even doing here?” Norman taunted. “Don’t tell me you’re actually trying to win that bet—convincing Mr. Vasilos to let the Morettis off the hook? You’ve got a death wish.”</p><p>Charles held his gaze, cold and steady. He wouldn’t give Norman the satisfaction of seeing his anger. “That’s none of your business.”</p><p>“Or maybe,” Norman sneered, stepping closer, “you think that Nytheris stone of yours is enough to buy Vasilos off? Let me tell you—it’ll get you killed. He makes a billion a month off the Morettis alone. Losing them would cripple his influence. You think one rare stone will cover that?”</p><p>Charles didn’t flinch. “If you’re this nervous, maybe you already know I can win. Why not save your breath and watch how this plays out?”</p><p>Norman sneered and took a step forward, his gaze raking over Charles with undisguised contempt.</p><p>&quot;Let me make this crystal clear, Charles,&quot; his voice dripped with malicious glee. &quot;You’ve always relied on luck, but it ends today. Vasilos will tear you apart. I am the only person who can helph you out. You have two choices. First, let your oh-so-noble fiancée, Serena, join me for dinner—though not in a restaurant, but in my private suite.&quot;</p><p>Charles’s eyes turned cold, but Norman only laughed harder.</p><p>&quot;Oh, don&#x27;t look so upset. Or...&quot; Norman deliberately drew out the word, &quot;Option two: send that little slut you’re keeping to my bed for the night. I hear she’s quite the charmer, isn&#x27;t she?&quot;</p><p>The guards around them stifled snickers. Norman reveled in the moment, like a cat toying with its prey.</p><p>&quot;Having trouble deciding?&quot; Norman feigned a sigh. &quot;Let me break it down for you. You’ve trespassed on Mr. Vasileos’s private property. Technically, the guards are within their rights to shoot you on sight. And I’ll be the witness to say you were armed and dangerous.&quot;</p><p>He leaned in closer to Charles, lowering his voice. &quot;Think about it. How long do you think Serena will mourn a lowlife’s death? A month? Then she’ll be in my arms. As for your little mistress... I’ll send her back to you when I’m done—assuming she can still walk.&quot;</p><p>The head guard stepped forward, his baton tapping lightly in his hand. &quot;Mr. Norman is right. Trespassing is a serious offense. We’re fully justified in taking necessary measures.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Got it?&quot; Norman smiled triumphantly. &quot;Now, make a choice. Serena or your little whore? Pick one, and I’ll let you walk out of here safely. Otherwise...&quot; He meaningfully glanced at the baton in the guard’s hand. &quot;You’ll be carried out.&quot;</p><p>Charles slowly lifted his head, his expression eerily calm, but his eyes gleamed with a dangerous light.</p><p>&quot;Finished?&quot; His voice was soft, yet it sent a chill through everyone present.</p><p>Norman paused, then flushed with anger. &quot;Do you think I’m joking? Guards, it seems this gentleman needs some... persuasion.&quot;</p><p>Two guards raised their batons and moved closer. At that moment, Charles suddenly laughed.</p><p>&quot;What are you laughing at?&quot; Norman demanded sharply.</p><p>&quot;I’m laughing at how pitiful you are. Are you done?” Charles said flatly, turning to leave.</p><p>But Norman wasn’t finished. The truth was, he was afraid—not of the deal, but of the stone itself. His father wanted it back, desperately. And if Charles used it…</p><p>“Don’t let him go!” Norman snapped at the guards. “He’s nobody. Calls himself Serena’s fiancé, but she only took pity on him. Look at him—no family, no name. He’s got nothing.”</p><p>Charles stayed silent. One word—one mention of the Godfather—and they’d be falling over themselves to let him in. But he couldn’t reveal that. Not yet.</p><p>“See?” Norman jeered. “He can’t answer. He’s using Serena’s name because it’s all he has. Throw him out—now.”</p><p>The second guard hesitated. “We should call Mr. Vasilos. It’s procedure.”</p><p>“Use your brain!” the first guard shot back. “We don’t bother Vasilos with trash. He’s clearly trouble.”</p><p>Norman grinned. “Exactly. Get rid of him.”</p><p>“By what right?” Charles asked, his voice dangerously calm.</p><p>“By this right,” Norman said, gesturing to the guards. “Respect. Power. Something you’ll never have—not even with that stone.”</p><p>But the second guard still looked uneasy. He turned to Charles. “Your name, sir?”</p><p>“Charles. Serena’s fiancé.”</p><p>As the guard moved to pick up the phone, the other snatched it away. </p><p>“We’re not calling anyone. He is nobody.” He grabbed a baton, stepping into Charles’s space. “You will pay for your  behavior.”</p><p>Norman watched, smug. “Good man.”</p><p>The guard raised the baton—</p><p>“What’s going on here?”</p><p>A new voice cut through the tension. Every head turned.</p></div>
