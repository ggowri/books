        <h1>Chapter 13.</h1>
        <div>For a fleeting second, he had this ridiculous thought.<br/>‘Maybe I should just go along with it… one night, and I’d have free rent, no commission, no fees. I could keep my money. If I don’t get this place, where will I even sleep tonight? Out on the streets? That would be horrible. Just one night with this woman, and everything would be solved’.<br/>His chest tightened. He thought he wasn’t even really married anymore. Tracy did worse. She lay with another man without hesitation. Why should he carry guilt when she never did?<br/>The woman’s hand slid brazenly onto his thigh, fingers creeping higher. She giggled through a mouthful of gum, pressing closer.<br/>But suddenly, Charles jerked her hand away, his eyes blazing.<br/>“Get away from me, old hag! Why are you like this? You’re old enough to be my mother, and you want to use my situation against me?”<br/>The room went dead silent for a moment. Her expression hardened, the flirtation vanishing in an instant.<br/>“You…” she spat, pointing a trembling finger at him. “You poor, broken piece of trash. You have no house, no money, and probably not even a wife. And yet, you stand here acting like you have pride?”<br/>Charles clenched his fists, his throat tight. Her words cut deeper than he expected.<br/>“You think being a firefighter makes you a man?” she sneered, her voice rising. “You risk your life, and for what? You can’t even pay rent. Men like you end up begging, crawling. You should be grateful I even looked at you.”<br/>He stood frozen, heart pounding. Her insults weren’t new...Tracy had stabbed him with those same words more times than he could count. But hearing them now, from a stranger, still stung like fire on raw skin.<br/>“Get out! You’re not getting this house. Not for a penny less than $1,500. Go sleep on the streets, hero. See how long your pride feeds you!” The lady picked up his luggage and threw it onto the street.<br/>“A fool of a man! I can see why you’re lonely.”<br/>Charles swallowed hard, every muscle in his body shaking with restrained anger. His eyes heavy with shame, he walked out. Passersby mocked him as they saw him picking up his scattered luggage.<br/>His chest burned...not from what just happened, but from the source of it all. Tracy.<br/>If he had agreed… he would be no different from Tracy. He was in this situation because of her, and he wouldn’t repeat her sins. Not even for a roof over his head.<br/>Charles pulled his suitcase closer, the city suddenly feeling colder. He had nowhere to go. He just walked like a zombie.<br/>---<br/>Meanwhile, during all these ordeals, Tracy was in a bar with Derek.<br/>Instead of her usual composed, elegant style, Tracy had gone bold that night. She wore a daring mini skirt that showed off her long, toned legs, wrapped in sheer black stockings. Pointed heels clicked against the floor with every step, and her hair cascaded down in loose, glamorous waves. Her face was layered with heavy makeup, the kind that turned heads instantly. Tracy radiated pure allure.<br/>Derek, standing close beside her, was practically captivated. His gaze lingered on her every curve, his breath catching.<br/>“Tracy… you look unbelievable tonight,” he said, voice low with admiration.<br/>“Even when we were together before, I never saw you dress like this.”<br/>Tracy tilted her head, her lips curving into a faint, teasing smile.<br/>“Do I look good?” she asked.<br/>“Good? You’re the most stunning woman in this place,” Derek replied, almost breathless.<br/>“Then… Do you like it?” she pressed softly.<br/>“I love it,” Derek admitted, his throat tightening. Then, half-joking, half-nervous, he added, “But… wouldn’t your husband mind me saying that? What if he saw us again?”<br/>Tracy’s expression didn’t waver; her eyes stayed cold, detached.<br/>“Let’s not mention him,” she said flatly. “We’re here to enjoy ourselves. Come on, let’s grab a drink.”<br/>“Of course,” Derek said, though his gaze remained fixed on her with a hungry intensity. “But Tracy… maybe we should get a private room instead? You’re so gorgeous tonight, I’m worried people will stare. Also, your husband might see us.”<br/>His eyes darkened with a possessive gleam as he looked at her.<br/>“No,” Tracy cut him off firmly. “We’re staying here. Nothing will happen.”<br/>Before Derek could protest, she slid an arm around his neck, pressing herself against him, her perfume enveloping him like a spell. He smiled. Finally, he was going to have Tracy. Charles had been the one stopping him, but it seemed like Tracy was over Charles now.<br/>From the corner of the bar, someone was filming them.<br/>---<br/>Meanwhile, Charles dragged his battered suitcase along the cracked pavement, the wheels rattling against every stone. His shoulders sagged as he searched for a lodge that would at least take him in for three nights with $1,000.<br/>His phone buzzed in his pocket. He fished it out with numb fingers and turned it on.<br/>It was a video message.<br/>Even before pressing play, his stomach turned. The preview showed Tracy arms wrapped tightly around another man. Derek.<br/>He lifelessly glanced at it, and a second notification popped up. It was a text message from the same contact.<br/>[Isn’t that your wife!? Check the video]<br/>It was from John.<br/>He didn’t even need to play it to know it was Tracy. He had been hiding the embarrassment of the divorce from John for days. And now, Tracy had exposed it to him.<br/>He tapped the video.</div>
