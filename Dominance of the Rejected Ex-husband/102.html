        <h1>Chapter 102</h1>
        <div>Norman walked toward Serena and Charles. Serena was surprised to see him approach. Norman loved her—seeing her with another man would drive him crazy. Even worse, he had lost the bet to Charles.<br/>He hadn’t even shown up at the Moretti compound since then, unwilling to face the consequences of his loss.<br/>“Hey, Serena,” he greeted casually.<br/>Serena smiled faintly. “Fine, Norman. Long time.”<br/>He nodded, then glanced at Charles, sizing him up as if he were nothing.<br/>“Well, congratulations,” Norman said, turning back to Serena. “You really deserve the best.”<br/>Serena smiled awkwardly, wondering why Norman was suddenly being so nice.<br/>“Thanks, Norman,” she replied.<br/>He smiled back and turned to leave—but as he walked past Charles, he deliberately bumped into him.<br/>Charles nearly lost his balance before steadying himself. In that brief moment, Norman slipped the wristwatch into his pocket.<br/>“I’m sorry... sorry, I wasn’t watching where I was going,” Norman said quietly, pretending to sound sincere.<br/>Charles looked at him suspiciously. The Norman he knew would never apologize, even if he was clearly in the wrong. Something felt off.<br/>Serena frowned. “He’s probably drunk. He should just leave before he causes a scene.”<br/>Charles nodded. Drunk—that was the only explanation that made sense.<br/>The party carried on. Guests kept flooding in to congratulate Serena and Charles.<br/>Then, suddenly, a phone shrieked and startled everyone.<br/>“Where the hell is my wristwatch?”<br/>It was Old Mr. Edward. He was frantically searching around the table.<br/>At first, people weren’t too concerned, thinking he must have misplaced it and would find it soon.<br/>But when he didn’t, he shouted again, louder this time. “I put my wristwatch right here! Did anyone see it?”<br/>He looked around desperately, but everyone shook their heads. Among them stood Norman, pretending to look just as puzzled as the rest.<br/>Norman rushed to Mr. Edward and bent over the table as if he, too, could make the watch reappear by force of will. The old man rocked on his heels, wild eyes cutting the room in half.<br/>“My wristwatch,” he shouted, voice raw. “Gold and diamonds. Worth over a million. I’ve been saving for years. I put it here. I —” He shoved a hand through his hair. “I blame myself. I left it for a second.”<br/>Norman’s face stayed calm. “I can’t find it,” he said. “It’s obvious. It was stolen.”<br/>“Stolen?” Mr. Edward roared. The word tore out of him. “My damn wristwatch. No. I will kill myself if I don’t find it. And I’ll kill whoever stole it when I catch them. You better come out now and give it back!!!”<br/>People circled the table. Guests began to search pockets and under plates. Voices rose. Someone muttered about calling the police. Others rifled through coats. <br/>“Whoever stole it might be with us,” Norman called out, loud enough to cut the smaller noises. “I think we should all be searched.”<br/>An elder at the head of the table bristled. “Absolutely not,” he said. “We are not going to be disrupted like common thieves. Everyone here is rich and wealthy!”<br/>“Impossible,” another woman added. “This is an honourable house. He must have misplaced it.”<br/>Norman let the objections hang for a breath. Then he leaned in, slow. “Well,” he said, each word deliberate, “what if I tell you I know who might have stolen it?”<br/>Silence hit like a blade. Everyone went quiet, before they erupted again. <br/>Murmurs rippled through the crowd like a slow, rising wind.<br/>“What’s he talking about?” someone whispered.<br/>“Who might have taken it?” another muttered.<br/>Mr. Edward straightened, glaring at Norman. “Really?”<br/>Norman raised both hands, feigning calm. “I’m not saying for sure. I just have my suspicions.”<br/>“Then say it,” Mr. Edward snapped. “At least tell us who you think it is.”<br/>Norman hesitated just long enough to draw every eye. Then he lifted a finger—straight at Charles. <br/>“Him. I saw him come to the table and leave a moment later. He might have taken it.”<br/>Gasps followed. Heads turned sharply.<br/>“What? Miss Serena’s fiancé?” someone whispered. “Today of all days?”<br/>Another voice said, “That can’t be true. I doubt it.”<br/>A third joined, “What’s Norman even saying? How would he do this on such an honorable day?”<br/>Tracy and a few others pushed through the crowd, drawn by the noise.<br/>Charles scoffed, stepping forward. “What the hell are you talking about? I didn’t even come near your table, and you’re accusing me of stealing a wristwatch?”<br/>Norman shrugged, keeping his tone soft and reasonable. “Honestly, it’s just my suspicion. But I saw you sneaking toward the table earlier.”<br/>Serena stepped in, her voice sharp. “Norman, watch what you say. He was with me the entire time.”<br/>Norman’s smile faded into something colder. “That’s exactly the problem. I told you, he sneaked there. I didn’t understand it at first. He made sure no one saw him. But now…” He looked around, meeting every eye in the room. “Now I’m sure he took it.”<br/>The air thickened. Eyes darted between Charles and Norman. Mr. Edward’s breathing grew heavy. <br/>The murmurs rose again, louder this time, like a wave breaking through the hall.<br/>“How could someone sneak around this room and no one notice?” a man in a navy suit asked, disbelief in his tone.<br/>“That’s impossible,” said another, fanning herself nervously. “There are too many eyes here.”<br/>A third voice, sharp and skeptical, added, “Unless he turned too thin air.”<br/>Someone else muttered, “Mr. Norman should stop accusing someone.”<br/>Norman raised his hand slightly, as if to calm the noise. His tone turned grave and measured. <br/>“We are missing something important here. Everyone in this room is from a respected background. The elites, the wealthy, the powerful—except one person.” He paused, eyes fixed on Charles. “And it’s him. You know how skillful poor people can be when it comes to stealing.”<br/>The words landed on the ego of the people. <br/>“Oh, that’s true,” someone said almost too quickly. “It actually makes sense.”<br/>Another nodded. “I’ve never felt comfortable with him here, to be honest. He doesn’t fit in.”<br/>A woman whispered to her friend, “It’s logical, isn’t it? No one else would dare steal something here. Only someone desperate would.”<br/>And soon, heads began to nod all around. Agreement spread through the crowd.<br/>Charles stood there, frozen for a moment as he glanced at Norman, who subtly smirked at him. </div>
