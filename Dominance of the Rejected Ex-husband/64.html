        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div><p>Charles still stood there, horrified, because this eye power was technically part of his mission: the Godfather had made it clear he would have to unleash all levels of his eyes before he could assume leadership.</p><p>“Are you telling me I will have to marry ten wives?” Charles said. Instantly, in his mind he reduced it to nine — minus Tracy.</p><p>Lizzypie just scoffed. “What are you saying? Because we fucked doesn’t mean we have to get married.”</p><p>Charles was a man of morals. He said, “Virginity is a symbol of pride and virtue. I have to take responsibility for them — especially you.”</p><p>Lizzypie chuckled and said, “Oh, okay, but you have to up your game to encounter eight more virgins who will allow you to sleep with them.”</p><p>He nodded. “Okay, my wife, I will have to learn a lot from you.”</p><p>“Mmm… who is your wife?” Lizzypie sounded.</p><p>“You, of course — you are my first wife. Mmm… babe, aren’t you?” he said, and moved closer to her, then started tickling her, playing with her. Lizzypie giggled, and when Charles tried to hold her waist she slightly pushed him away.</p><p>“Hey, what are you doing? Mmm… you are trying to lure me to bed again. Because I let you have sex with me once doesn’t mean there will be a second time. The Godfather sent me here to assist you as your assistant, not for sex. Show some respect from now on,” she snapped at him.</p><p>Charles gulped and just withdrew; he didn’t have any intention of sleeping with her, and Lizzypie had taken it the wrong way. He then slowly made his way to the sofa and sat down. Lizzypie saw the sadness on his face and bit her lip.</p><p>“Mmm… so, are you able to make the 40 million needed for the figs of vigour herbs?” she asked.</p><p>Charles brought out his ATM card, gave it to her and told her the password. “I made 100 million.”</p><p>“Wow, that is a lot. Well, I will remove the 40 million and return the card,” she said.</p><p>“No — you can keep the card and manage the remaining 60 million for me. Anything you want to use it for, you can do it.”</p><p>Lizzypie was surprised. “Manage all the money?” she asked.</p><p>Charles nodded. “Yes. Lizzypie, you will always be in charge of my money and property. Even if I make it big and become the Godfather, everything that’s mine will be yours. Like I said, you’re my first wife, and I trust you with my whole life.”</p><p>Lizzypie just stood there,  impressed, but also shocked.</p><p>Charles stood up quietly and walked toward his room. Lizzypie scoffed under her breath. “This bastard sure knows how to impress and charm a woman,” she muttered.</p><p>Then she sighed as her phone buzzed. A message flashed across the screen:</p><p>Remember, you have to stay neutral from now on.</p><p>Lizzypie stared at it for a long moment before exhaling deeply. That message was one of the main reasons she had been pushing Charles away.</p><p>The next morning, Charles groaned as he woke up and dragged himself out of bed. His body still felt heavy from the night before. When he stepped out of his room, a warm aroma filled the entire apartment — rich, savory, comforting.</p><p>He followed the scent to the dining table and saw that Lizzypie had already cooked. A pot of  rice with fried plantains and spicy grilled chicken sat there, neatly covered.</p><p>On the table beside it was a folded note.</p><p>Charles picked it up and read:</p><p>I’m on my way to buy herbs. Sorry for my behavior last night. I’m so sorry. ❤. A small heart sticker was drawn beside the words.</p><p>Charles smiled faintly. Though he had been hurt by what she said the previous night, the note seemed to melt everything away. His chest loosened, and he felt warmth spread through him.</p><p>He sat down and began eating.</p><p>After finishing his bath, he went up to the rooftop of the apartment. The morning sun burned gently above him. He sat down directly beneath it, placed the sapphire stone in front of him, crossed his legs, and began to meditate, just as Lizzypie had instructed him to do.</p><p>Hours passed. The sun moved, shadows stretched, and still he sat.  He was like that for twelve hours.</p><p>He didn’t even notice when evening fell. His focus had become absolute as his mind wrapped around the pulse of the sapphire, trying to feel it, trying to bridge the invisible gap between man and stone.</p><p>Then, it happened.</p><p>The sapphire began to shimmer. The light grew stronger, and before he could react, a thread of light burst out and shot straight toward him. It entered through his nose like a breath. He gasped as the light sank deep inside him, rushing through his veins like liquid fire.</p><p>His body trembled. His head snapped up.</p><p>And when his eyes opened, they burned with a radiant glow. His once-dark pupils had turned yellow, bright and alive, like molten gold. He gasped.</p><p>Some hours later, late in the night, Lizzypie returned home, she still hadn&#x27;t even sat down when Charles shouted.</p><p>“I made it! I did it! My X-ray eyes have improved, I can now see beyond flesh, I can see your bone now, like how normal x-ray would, also, I can even see beyond the wall, like it wasn’t there” Charles was very happy. His X-ray improved so much, that in fact, the eyes can sense upcoming danger and alert him!</p><p>Lizzypie smiled, “wow, you improved a lot and faster than I expected, you must have spent many hours!”</p><p>Truly, he had spent over 12 hours, just meditating.  He was all over the moon, this gave him so much power.</p><p> Then he asked, “what… what about the herb, you get it?”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded, and sighed as she brought out a small box, “Yeah, but there is more to it than I expected”</p></div>
