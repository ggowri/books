        <h1>Chapter 92</h1>
        <div><p>Charles’s eyes squinted at the stone very well, setting his x-ray vision well; it was so obvious to him that there is no content in all of the stone.</p><p>They were more than 100.</p><p>Charles faced Natasha, “Where did you get all these stones? None of them has anything inside, the stones are all empty.”</p><p>Natasha frowned and scoffed it off, flinging her hand, “That is impossible — there are over 100 stones here, and I get each for at least 2 million, so you are telling me all this over 200 million worth of stones is empty?”</p><p>Charles had to check again and they were all empty, “I can tell you, they are all empty.”</p><p>Still, Natasha was finding it very hard to believe him; this stone content can’t be known unless it was cut and everyone sees the content</p><p>Though she believed Charles has some talent identifying worthy stones, just like he had proved himself last time, but this… he didn’t even pick them, just a glance at it; he simply said the stone is empty.</p><p>She nodded, “No, that can’t be possible, it’s not possible — how can you even tell each has no content?”</p><p>As soon as she finished this, she had her doubts because before Charles over 20 people had come to cut and there saw nothing.</p><p>She believed it was their luck, but that was affecting her business. Because sometimes, when people buy stones, see gems, they sell them to her and she makes jewelry out of them; that is her main source of income.</p><p>Stones without any gem is a disaster. Charles sighed, finding a way to explain better, “Look — let me ask you, where did you even get all this stone?”</p><p>Natasha sat down in shock and replied, “My brother… Since Norman refused to sell us stones, my brother has been the one getting it for me. I sent him money and he does the jobs and transporting of the stones.”</p><p>Charles frowned, “You mean that your brother of other day, the one that sent thugs here?”</p><p>“Yeah… I had given him the money before the thug incident. I still couldn’t believe my brother would do such a thing; in fact we haven’t talked since then. I can’t fathom it, he is my only fucking family,” she cried out.</p><p>Talking of the devil, the door flung open and a tall man, with curly Asian hair and a broad face, entered.</p><p>Looking at his face, Charles could immediately see that this man is Natasha’s brother.</p><p>“Hey sister… how is work, how has it been going?” the man said, walking closer. Natasha was visibly startled to see him here;</p><p>she muttered, “Steven?”</p><p>Steven put on a thin and mischievous smile, “Yeah, it’s me. You must be so shocked. I just came here to see you, how is work, hope it has been going well.”</p><p>He was acting like nothing was wrong and that he wasn’t behind the thugs and the stones.</p><p>Natasha just stood there, trembling while Steven walked towards her. “Hey sister, what happened, why are you ignoring me?”</p><p>Just as he was about to get closer to her, Charles walked in front of him and spared his hand, “Step back.” Steven frowned looking up. “And who are you? Why are you stopping me from hugging my sister?”</p><p>Charles looked at him with a very hard gaze, “She didn’t want to hug. Now step back.”</p><p>Steven scoffed then glanced at Natasha, “Is it true you don’t want to hug me? It’s me… your precious brother.”</p><p>Charles stared at Natasha waiting for her response. She slowly nodded her head, saying no, she didn’t want to hug.</p><p>Steven still put on a smirk, “Why, sister?”</p><p>“Maybe it’s because you sent thugs here to damage her store, destroy everything and bring her a bunch of empty stones after she gave you 200 million dollars to get mining stone!” Charles roared at him.</p><p>Steven squinted his face for a long moment before he broke, “You must be Charles, I have heard a lot about you… looking up closer, you seem so familiar — have I seen you somewhere before?”</p><p>Charles stepped close, his voice a low threat. &quot;The truth. Did you do it?&quot;</p><p>Steven forced a laugh. &quot;Thugs? Fake stones? You&#x27;re crazy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Am I?&quot; Charles pulled the black velvet pouch from his coat and dumped the fake stones onto the floor. The sight broke Steven. He turned to run, but Charles was faster, grabbing his arm and yanking him back hard.</p><p>Steven stumbled, slamming shoulder-first into the wall. Trapped, his defiance vanished. A broken smirk twisted his lips. &quot;Fine! You want the truth? I sent them! I gave her empty rocks! I wanted to see her world burn! Happy now?&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, Natasha immediately went broke. Her legs became weak. Steven was her brother, her only family since 10 years ago their parents died!</p><p>“Why… why did you do that, why do you want to see me ruined!” she snarled at him. Steven walked around and said, “Because… none of this was supposed to be yours in the first place, it belongs to me. So I want to destroy it and get it back.”</p><p>Natasha frowned in confusion, “Not mine, how… Our parents gave me this store when it was so small, and I built it — what are you even saying?”</p><p>“Shut the fuck up. This store and our family inheritance is supposed to be mine. I am the older — I am your older brother, a man and the first born, but our parents left you the store and gave you all of our inheritance. They betrayed me. I endured all these times, looking for the perfect time to take it back. Well this is the time,” Steven boldly said.</p><p>Natasha couldn’t believe this. Before their parents died, her father asked who would keep the store running.</p><p>Then, it was so small and not this big — in fact, not prominent.</p><p>Steven had refused and rejected it, saying he didn’t want the stress. But Natasha took it; it was her dream to become a jewelry dealer.</p><p>When their parents suddenly died in a fatal accident, the will revealed that Natasha, who wanted the store, should also be given all the properties to upkeep it.</p><p>Natasha mentioned all this to him, and added, “You have also been good with this; I gave you 10 million dollars every month as part of your share in it, aren’t you enough of that, but you want the store?”</p><p>Steven angrily used his hand to jab a glass of jeweleries nearby and smashed it.</p><p>Smash!</p><p>“Fucking yeah, I want it now! Everything — the store and the properties. I am the rightful owner, so either you leave the store to me peacefully, or I take it forcefully!” he threatened.</p><p></p></div>
