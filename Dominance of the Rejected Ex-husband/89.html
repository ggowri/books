        <h1>Chapter 89</h1>
        <div><p>Charles’s hands shook as he lifted the hem of her top higher, peeling the fabric up and over her head in one slow, deliberate motion. The shirt slipped free, revealing Natasha’s bare body. </p><p>She wore only a delicate black lace bra, and her breasts, full and round, pushed against the cups bra, puffing out invitingly with each breath she took.</p><p>Charles’s body vibrated with a sudden surge of heat; he gulped hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing as his eyes locked on the smooth, flawless expanse of her Asian silky skin. </p><p> This was his first time seeing a body like hers up close, his cock hardened as he pressed his legs together to hide it.</p><p>Natasha’s voice cut through the haze, low and sultry. “I’m hot… help me remove my bra also.”</p><p>It was unmistakable now—she was seducing him, and it was working. </p><p>Charles couldn’t hold back the rush; his pulse thundered in his ears.“Please,” she murmured again, arching her back slightly.</p><p>His fingers fumbled to the clasp at her back. With a soft click, the bra loosened. He slid the straps down her shoulders.</p><p>Instantly, her breasts spilled free—pert, perfectly rounded, nipples hardening in the cool air.</p><p> They bounced gently with the release, drawing his gaze like magnets.Before he could process, Natasha’s hands shot up, fingers tangling in his hair. </p><p>She dragged him closer with surprising strength, pressing his mouth directly onto one of her nipples. </p><p> He felt the warmth and tasted the faint salt of her skin.“Please, fuck me” she breathed. </p><p>Charles’s lips closed around her nipple, sucking gently at first, then harder as Natasha moaned into his mouth. </p><p>Their kiss was fierce, tongues tangling, breaths ragged.</p><p> Her fingers clawed at his back while his hands kneaded her breasts, thumbs flicking the stiff peaks.</p><p>Natasha’s hands dropped to his waist, deftly unzipping his trousers. </p><p>“Please… fuck me already”, She begged again.</p><p>She freed his throbbing cock, stroking it once before sinking to her knees. Her mouth enveloped him—warm, wet, eager.</p><p>“Mmm… mmmm, so delicious!”.</p><p>“Ugn…fuck”.  Charles groaned, hips jerking as she sucked, tongue swirling, eyes locked on his.</p><p>He hauled her up, stripping off his own clothes in frantic pulls. “Please don’t stop,” she whispered, voice trembling with need.</p><p>Charles lifted her onto the bed, parting her thighs. He positioned himself, the tip of his cock nudging her slick entrance. </p><p>“Awww”.</p><p>One slow push—and he froze. She was impossibly tight, she was a virgin!.</p><p>“Damn!”,  Charles didn&#x27;t know when he let that out. He needed a virgin to unlock his next level, he had thought it would be so hard. But one just came to him, just like that.</p><p>A faint barrier gave way; a soft gasp escaped her lips.“Don’t stop,” Natasha urged, nails digging into his shoulders.</p><p>Charles couldn’t believe it, her first time, and she wanted him. </p><p> He then thrust deeper, inch by inch, until he filled her completely. </p><p>Charles gripped her hips, cock throbbing as he pulled back, then slammed into her tight pussy again. </p><p>Natasha arched, gasping, her virgin walls gripping him like velvet fire. </p><p>He thrust deep, cock stretching her slick heat, each stroke faster, harder.</p><p>“Fuck, your pussy’s so tight,” he growled, pounding relentlessly. </p><p>Her breasts bounced with every drive, nipples brushing his chest.</p><p>Natasha moaned, legs wrapping around him. “Harder… fill my pussy with your cock!”He obliged, cock plunging in and out, slick sounds filling the room.</p><p> Her pussy clenched, milking him as he fucked her raw, hips snapping, balls slapping against her. She came first, her pussy spasming, crying out as he kept thrusting, cock buried to the hilt until he exploded, flooding her pulsing pussy with hot cum.</p><p>Meanwhile, during all these, they were so carried away that they didn&#x27;t remember to close the door, and Derek was behind the door, witnessing their moments, and he even recorded it on his phone.</p><p>“Damn, This dude is so lucky, getting to fuck all beautiful women, But it&#x27;s over for you, if Ms. Serena sees this, he will eventually break up with you, I will publicise this everywhere!”. </p><p>He grinned at himself before sneaking away. </p><p>After the hot session, Charles and Natasha were on the sofa, heaving and breathing heavily.</p><p>Just then — suddenly, a screen popped out in front of him.</p><p>[Congratulations.  Eyes of Satan upgrade Successfully].</p><p>[Level 3 ~ Soul Sight].</p><p>[Ability to know what will happen 5 seconds before: seeing the future].</p><p>[Percentage value: 20%].</p><p>Charles squinted his face as he read everything. The third level has been unlocked, and he can see what happens in Future 5 second. That was gold!!!.</p><p>He was surprised, because this dashboard thing was new to him. He wondered what the percentage value meant. </p><p>Then, a sharp ping echoed in his head, and then another line appeared beneath the glowing text.</p><p> [Explanation: Percentage Value indicates current strength and endurance of the Soul Sight.]</p><p>[10–40% = Weak. Ability drains quickly and may cause strain if you try to use too much.]</p><p>[50–80% = Stable. Can be used moderately without exhaustion.]</p><p>[90–100% = Excellent. Continuous use is possible without backlash.]</p><p>Charles frowned. He could see 5s in future — but only barely, and not for long. </p><p>Still, a thrill ran through him. Weak or not, this was real, terrifying power.</p><p>He was still in daze when Natasha noticed him.</p><p>“Are you okay?”, She asked.</p><p>He turned to her, and decided to use the power. </p><p>[Soul sight activated].</p><p>Then his head went blank and could see what Natasha would do next. (She will tell him she was sorry for seducing him, and she regrets it, and is also worried about Serena).</p><p>Before she could even put it out, Charles interrupted, “uhm, you don&#x27;t have to worry”</p><p>Natasha frowned, wondering what she was talking about. “mmm…”</p><p>“I know you are worried about Serena finding this out, you shouldn&#x27;t”, He said.</p><p>Natasha wondered how he got it right. She shrugged it off, maybe he was just as worried as her.</p><p>But still, she still put it out, “I&#x27;m sorry, I seduced you… I was just horny and crazy,it will never happen again”. She apologised while Charles just scoffed it off. </p></div>
