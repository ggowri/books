        <h1>chapter 76</h1>
        <div><p>When Charles arrived, the door was slightly open. He stepped inside quietly and found only Francis in the living room. The boy was playing with an electric socket, pushing a metal rod near it. </p><p>Charles’ eyes widened he rushed forward, yelled, and pulled the boy away. Carrying him away from the dangerous gadget. That was when Francis started crying—loudly, painfully, like someone had struck him.</p><p>A moment later, footsteps echoed. Tracy rushed in, her eyes sharp. “What did you do to him?” she demanded. Francis, still crying, whimpered through tears, “I was just playing, and this man yelled at me and hit me!”</p><p>He lied. He knew Charles and he knew that if Charles left, Derek would win. Derek would be with Tracy and that would be his new family. He wanted Tracy to be her mommy so bad.</p><p>Derek stormed in. “What? You dare touch my son?! What kind of arrogance is this?”</p><p>Charles sighed and raised his hands. “Calm down, all of you. I was saving him. You left him alone in the living room, playing with an electric gadget. I had to carry him away before he got electrocuted. I never touched him.”</p><p>Derek’s face burned red. “So now you’re saying my son lied? An eight-year-old boy? You hit him—and I will do the same to you!”</p><p>He lunged forward, raising his hand, but Charles caught his wrist mid-air and flung him to the ground. Derek crashed, coughing.</p><p>Tracy gasped. “How dare you come here and cause a scene! You hit Francis! I know you never liked him. He is the reason for our divorce. Are you still holding hatred toward him? He’s a child, Charles. A child!”</p><p>Charles clenched his jaw. “I told you what happened. If you have any cameras in this room, check them. I saved him, Tracy.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey appeared from the hallway, fuming. “So you want us to waste time checking cameras for something you obviously did? You are the worst man alive, Charles. I thank God my daughter divorced you.”</p><p>Tracy’s voice cut through the noise. “Is this new money you are making makes you arrogant? What are you even here for? Did you lose something?”</p><p>Charles felt the anger rise, but he swallowed it. He didn’t come here to argue. “Listen,” he said firmly, “you have been told by Derek and your mother to sign some partnership deal with a company. It’s fake. A setup. You will lose everything. Derek is using you. Don’t sign it.”</p><p>Everyone froze. </p><p>Derek’s expression shifted with panic behind the rage. “What the hell are you talking about? Are you talking about the company that runs partnership deals with top business figures? You have lost your mind.”</p><p>Charles took a step closer. “Yeah, Derek. I know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s a trap and there is no company as such.”</p><p>Tracy frowned. “How do you even know about that? How could you know I’m about to sign something like that?”</p><p>Derek gulped hard. He hadn’t expected Charles to find out. If Charles knew, his plan would be revealed.</p><p>Charles was ready to expose everything—Derek’s lies, his scams, and the sick relationship between him and Mrs. Hailey. But before he could open his mouth, Mrs. Hailey quickly interrupted, “What do you think, Tracy? He overheard us! We discussed this earlier today. He must have sneaked in, eavesdropping on our conversation!”</p><p>Derek nodded immediately. “Yes! That’s exactly what happened. Your mother is right. He’s bitter, Tracy. Bitter that you moved on. He wants to stop you from being great.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey added sharply, “Yes, he probably heard about the profits and came here to ruin your chance. He doesn’t want you to grow.”</p><p>Tracy’s expression hardened. She turned to Charles. “You’re unbelievable. I saved your life yesterday. I warned you about Norman. You could have been dead. And instead of being grateful, you are here trying to gate keep me from success?”</p><p>Charles stepped forward, frustration in his voice. “I came because I am grateful! That’s why I’m warning you. This contract is a trap, Tracy! You will lose everything. Derek’s setting you up.”</p><p>But Derek had mastered his act. He wore a sorrowful, broken face—the one that always worked. “Tracy, I’ve seen enough,” he said softly. “Maybe it’s best we end this. I feel like I’m the reason you and Charles broke up. I can see he still loves you. That’s why he’s doing all this—lying about me, about my son, about the company. He’s jealous. He’s obsessed. Charles is the worst man I have ever met.”</p><p>The fake pity worked again. Tracy’s face twisted in confusion and hurt. “So you still love me, Charles? Is that what this is? You want me back? That’s why you came?”</p><p>Charles laughed dryly. “You think this is about love?”</p><p>“What else?” she shot back. “You’re trying to make everyone look bad, like you’re some savior. You overheard our conversation and came here to sabotage it. You’re jealous of Derek. You hate that I’ve moved on.”</p><p>Her voice trembled with anger and pride. “You think that Nytheris Stone you found makes you somebody? You are still poor, still nobody. That stone won’t get you anywhere. Come back when you actually have real money.”</p><p>Charles stared at her, quiet. Now he saw her clearly, Tracy was just a woman who left him for status, and couldn’t stand that he was poor. Now that he had some money, she was ready to reconsider—but pride would not make her admit it. He saw how shallow she was.</p><p>“I tried,” he said finally. “You can do whatever you want. Sign it at your own peril. I’m done.”</p><p>But Tracy wasn’t finished. She wanted to humiliate him. “Yeah, I’ll sign it. Right here. Right now.  You will see nothing will happen to me.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey immediately grabbed the papers from the table and handed them over. “Show him, Tracy. Show him you’re stronger than this. Do what you want. Don’t let him control your life.”</p><p>Tracy smirked, looked Charles dead in the eye, and said, “Watch closely.” She picked up the pen and began signing.</p><p>Charles watched as she signed it, but he said nothing. Derek grinned from ear to ear. His trap was sealed.</p><p>“There,” Tracy said with a proud smirk, tossing the pen onto the table. “You see? I have signed it. And nothing’s going to happen to me.”</p><p>Charles looked at her, then he smiled faintly. “We will see,” he said quietly, and turned to leave.</p><p></p></div>
