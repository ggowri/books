        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div><p>The intelligent officers’ guards were not a problem for Charles to take on, but it was the aftermath he worried about. Beating up government-owned personnel would come with serious consequences. He wondered if even the godfather could get him out of it.</p><p>He hesitated, but the guards weren’t stopping—they were ready to strike. Derek stood there, anticipating the moment he would finally see Charles humiliated.</p><p>“Hey, what the hell is happening here?” a voice called from behind. Everyone halted and turned.</p><p>Into view came two women, both radiating power and beauty. Everyone’s jaw dropped at their outfits and the way they carried themselves. Behind them flanked four separate armies, their caps marked with state insignia—it was obvious they were state forces.</p><p>The women were Serena and Diana. Diana, the state secretary, was Serena’s best friend. She had been sent here by the president himself to represent the state. The auction had been approved by the government and should  be properly monitored.</p><p>As soon as the security guards saw her, they immediately bowed, but Serena walked straight toward the commotion.</p><p>“What the hell is going on here? You are causing a commotion in a national hall?” she demanded.</p><p>Serena’s gaze locked on Charles, and she smirked. Charles smiled back.</p><p>Norman stepped forward. “Ma’am… it’s this man and the woman he brought with him. The woman slapped another woman, and this man defended her! I told them if they didn’t apologize, I would have them removed. People like this shouldn’t be here—they’re a disgrace.”</p><p>Diana faced Charles and the woman he had been referring to. As she stared at Charles, she immediately recognized him as Serena’s fiancé. Her brow furrowed.</p><p>“Wait… Serena, isn’t this your fiancé? The one you posted about some days ago?”</p><p>Serena simply smiled and nodded. “Yes.”</p><p>Diana was furious. Serena was her best friend, and now her fiancé had dared to bring another woman to the event and cause such chaos.</p><p>Norman saw an opportunity to strike even harder at Charles. “I was just as surprised, ma’am. Ms. Serena is the most beautiful and successful woman in this city—every woman envies her and every man wants her. Yet this man, her fiancé, disrespectfully brought a woman like this and caused a scene. I’m sure he didn’t expect Ms. Serena to be here. Let us disgrace him and throw him out.”</p><p>Diana shared Norman’s anger. She wanted to throw them out instantly but decided to hear the other side of the story first.</p><p>“Ma’am, she was the one who called me a bitch and a prostitute first, so I slapped her,” Lizzypie said. She added firmly, “Also, Charles is my friend, I am not a whore. That is a total disrespect!”</p><p>Derek chimed in, “Shut up! Don’t hide your indecency behind being a friend! A whore—that’s what you are!”</p><p>Norman’s voice grew louder, sharper. “Look at this disgrace! Bringing women here, causing a scene… A poor man like him will never have sense or loyalty! Ms. Serena should have only engaged with him out of pity, yet here he is, carrying women around like he owns the place!”</p><p>Another voice from the crowd shouted, “Exactly! a man without honor, he doesn’t deserve her!”</p><p>“Shame!” someone else added, pointing at Charles. “To think Ms. Serena’s engagement was supposed to be about love, yet he treats her like this!”</p><p>The crowd’s murmurs turned to shouts, and all eyes burned holes into Charles. </p><p>Derek stepped forward, grinning darkly, “Ms. Serena! I told you this man is someone else, someone who cannot be trusted. Now that it’s obvious who he is, let’s break his knees for this rubbish!”</p><p>Diana looked at her friend, waiting for her judgment, she was ready to have Charles beat up for what he did to her friend.</p><p>Then, Serena walked slowly over to Charles. Everyone was waiting silently for her to slap him and blast him off, but without a word, she wrapped her arms around him and gave him a tight hug.</p><p>“Babe, you came here first,” she whispered. “I’m sorry for arriving late and for all this commotion.”</p><p>The hall froze. Gasps echoed everywhere. People couldn’t believe it, after everything, she was hugging him.</p><p>Charles stood stiff at first, wondering what her deal was, then relaxed into her arms, and hugged her back.</p><p> This made everyone&#x27;s jaws drop.</p><p>The hug was so intense and long before they pulled over. Then, she turned to lizzypie, “Thanks pal, for accompanying him here, I am also sorry for the commotion”. She then hugged lizzypie also. This made everyone lose it.</p><p>“what? Is she under a spell? She just hugged her unfaithful fiancée and his whore!”.</p><p>“What is Ms. Serena doing,  instead of slapping him?”.</p><p>Serena then pulled away from lizzypie also and faced Tracy, “why do you call someone a whore in the first place, you deserve more than a slap”.</p><p>Tracy was shocked, she mumbled but nothing came out from her mouth. </p><p>Norman chimed in, “serena…. Hmm, she is a whore because she is sleeping with your fiancée”.</p><p>Smack.</p><p>Serena struck Norman. Everyone gasped and Norman just stood there, horrified and feeling embarrassed as he held his cheek.</p><p>“Like I said, whoever calls her a whore deserves a slap! What audacity do you have to call her that!” she sneered, and continued, “lizzypie here isn’t involved with my fiancée in any romantic way, lizzypie is my friend, and I was the one that pleaded with her to accompany my husband here!” Serena shrieked at them.</p><p>Norman and Derek recoiled. Serena and lizzypie are friends?</p><p>Diana asked, “so, your fiancée is with this man because you asked her and you both are friends?”</p><p>Serena affirmatively nodded, “yes”.</p><p>Charles and Lizzypie stared at each other. </p></div>
