        <h1>Chapter 178</h1>
        <div><p>As soon as the man yelled, everyone rushed forward to see what he was watching, while others checked their phones.</p><p>It was Paul, Mr. Damien’s son. He was live on tiktok sobbing as he confessed to all the terrible things he had done.</p><p>He admitted that the video showing Charles begging for money was a lie, staged by him. He explained the reason behind it.</p><p>Charles had knelt only to collect an inhaler from him for a dying girl he had bullied. Paul went on to confess that he was a bully and even played videos of himself harassing and beating others.</p><p>“I’m making this video to ask for forgiveness for my terrible actions and behavior,” he said through tears. </p><p>“Please forgive me. And Mr. Charles, the man in that video, wasn&#x27;t begging for money. He was begging for an inhaler.”</p><p>With that, the live stream ended. Behind the scene was lizzypie who forced the confession out of him</p><p>Instantly, the hall fell silent. People swallowed hard and avoided each other’s eyes. They had abused and mocked Charles because of that video.</p><p> Now, they were all wrong. </p><p>Serena smiled softly. “I knew it,” she said. “I knew you had your reason for kneeling before that boy. Once again, I chose the right side.”</p><p>She glanced at her family with an I told you so look before stepping forward and hugging Charles.</p><p>“I know you’re a good person,” she said. “You knelt down just to save a life.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Tracy, who had arrived late at the venue, had already watched everything unfold on the live stream.</p><p>As soon as she entered and saw Serena hugging Charles, some sort of jealousy burned through her.</p><p>Collins stood frozen where he was. To him, this was the end. The only power he ever had came from Mr. Damien backing him.</p><p>Now that Mr. Damien had been arrested, it was over for him. Everything would shift back to Serena.</p><p>It wasn’t long before Mr. Moretti turned toward Serena. </p><p>Mr. Moretti stared at his daughter, his face heavy with regret. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “I should have believed you.”</p><p>Serena’s expression hardened. “Stop right there, Father.”</p><p>She took a breath, her voice steady but cold. “You changed. Because of that project, you turned into someone else. I warned you again and again that Charles had his reasons, but you didn’t care. You were too busy licking Mr. Damien’s shoes.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti flinched.</p><p>“You sent me away because of him, and disowned me” she continued. “Do you know what’s worse?” Her eyes burned. “You sided with the man who molested me. Even after you saw what he did, you still lied to protect him.”</p><p>Her voice shook with disgust. “I felt sick. I felt like vomiting.”</p><p>People started chiming in, “That&#x27;s horrible truly, Mr. Moretti disappointed me”.</p><p>“He really did that, I felt like vomiting also!”.</p><p>Serena straightened and added. “And look, I don’t care about the company. I don’t care about being CEO. Do whatever the hell you want.”</p><p>With that, Serena reached for Charles’ hand.</p><p>They turned and walked out of the hall together.</p><p>The crowd instinctively parted for them, whispers trailing in their wake.</p><p>“We need to get close to that Charles.”</p><p>“If even the commander bowed to him, then he must have powerful connections.”</p><p>“I need to apologize for everything I said.”</p><p>“I will even give them a house to show my sincerity.”</p><p>“Poor or not, that heroic act alone will elevate him. I need to tap into that.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti heard every word and his chest tightened.</p><p>He had chosen the wrong side. And now it was already biting him back. He had spent heavily on Mr. Damien. Now Damien was finished. And so was everything tied to him.</p><p>Also, the people were now seeing him as a bad father. And that alone could damage his reputation.</p><p>Mr. Moretti clenched his fist. If things were to move smoothly from here on, there was only one option left. He had to get Charles on his side.</p><p>×××××</p><p>Outside the hall, Serena and Charles were still holding hands as they walked a short distance. It wasn’t until they stopped that Serena realized it. She quickly pulled her hand away.</p><p>She looked at him and gave a small smile. “That was… impressive back there.”</p><p>Charles smiled faintly.</p><p>“I always knew you would come out on top,” Serena continued. “But you should have at least told me before getting involved in something that dangerous.”</p><p>Charles just nodded.</p><p>She hesitated, then asked, “I’m curious. Why did you go after Mr. Damien so personally?”</p><p>Charles swallowed and immediately replied. “Because he messed with my friend.”</p><p>Serena frowned slightly. The answer felt weak, but she let it go.</p><p>After a moment, Charles asked, “Did you mean what you said in there? About not caring if you become CEO?”</p><p>Serena sighed. “I was angry. Of course I care. That’s my life’s dream.” She straightened, confidence returning to her voice. “After everything that happened today, they will call me back to be the CEO…  it’s inevitable.”</p><p>Charles nodded. “Yeah… that right”.</p><p>“And after that,” Serena added casually, “we can finally end this fake engagement and you can be free”</p><p>Something tightened in Charles’ chest. A brief, unexpected pang. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something…</p><p>“Charles!” someone yelled his name.</p><p>They both turned to it. Tracy was walking toward them.</p><p>Serena immediately stiffened. “I don’t want another drama,” she said quietly. “We will talk later.”</p><p>“Wait—” Charles started.</p><p>But Serena didn’t stop. She got into her car, closed the door, and drove off without looking back.</p><p>Charles stood there for a moment.</p><p>When he turned around, Tracy was already standing in front of him.</p><p></p></div>
