        <h1>Chapter 156</h1>
        <div><p>Mr. Moretti stared at him as if he had misheard. His voice dropped. “You really mean that?”</p><p>Charles nodded once. “Yes.”</p><p>He lifted his chin slightly. “Look. Just because I am your future son-in-law doesn’t mean I should subject myself to injustice. I was right. I won’t apologize.”</p><p>The room exploded.</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s face darkened instantly. To him it sounded like outright disrespect. Disobedience. A slap to the family’s authority.</p><p>Collins could barely hide his joy. He stepped forward quickly. “This is exactly what I’ve been saying Father. This man doesn’t deserve our family. He has no humility and no respect. Serena should be punished for even bringing someone like him into our home.”</p><p>Allison scoffed loudly. “Pathetic. Truly pathetic. That story about saving a child. Who knows if it was even true. I’m sure you knelt for money.”</p><p>Charles didn’t flinch. His eyes were cold now. “Believe whatever you want.”</p><p>That only fueled the fire.</p><p>Mr. Moretti turned sharply to Serena. “Did you hear him? He is ready to break up”</p><p>Serena stepped forward. “Father—”</p><p>“You will announce your disengagement from him. Right now,” Mr. Moretti said firmly.</p><p>Serena frowned. Her lips tightened before she spoke. “No. I’m not breaking our engagement.”</p><p>The room erupted again.</p><p>Mr. Gerald slammed his cane against the floor. “What the hell are you saying? Are you openly dishonoring your father now?”</p><p>Serena met his gaze without backing down. “I said what I said. I will not break my engagement over this injustice. It’s not fair. We shouldn’t be forced to break up because we are in the right.”</p><p>Collins clenched his fists. “Father. Are you really going to let her talk to you like this? She’s looking down on you.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti raised his hand and the noise died instantly. His voice was low but heavy.</p><p>“Serena,” he said slowly. “Mr. Damien has demanded to meet one of my children at the next meeting instead of me. He wants to evaluate my legacy before approving the Avaloz Project.”</p><p>The room stiffened.</p><p>“You are capable,” he continued. “You are the one I planned to send. But if you are still associated with Charles, you know it will cause problems.”</p><p>He looked straight at her, his tone final. “For things to go smoothly, you have to cut ties with him.”</p><p>Serena sighed softly. She knew everything about the Avaloz Project. She knew how much her father had invested, how long he had planned it, how he had even intended to place her at its head. </p><p>That position would not only make her popular, it would make her independent and fully established in the company.</p><p>And yet she still refused.</p><p>She lifted her head. “I can’t break our engagement.”</p><p>Charles turned to her sharply. For he was surprised. He couldn’t understand it. </p><p>This was supposed to be a fake relationship. Why was she being this stubborn? and wanted to throw everything because of him. </p><p>Mr. Moretti stared at her for a long moment, then spoke slowly. “Serena, I won’t force you. So let me ask you clearly. Will you choose this man, or will you choose your family.”</p><p>Serena let out a quiet laugh, tired and bitter. “You’re doing the same thing again.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti frowned. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>“The murder case,” Serena said firmly. “You turned your back on Charles and didn’t believe him to the end. You didn’t care about the truth just for him to prove you all wrong!.”</p><p>Mr Moretti&#x27;s voice hardened. “This is different. And it affects me and this family directly.”</p><p>Then Mr. Moretti added, “So you are saying you will choose Charles.”</p><p>Serena inhaled deeply. “I choose justice,” she said. “And justice is Charles.”</p><p>Collins scoffed loudly. “This is the person you want to make CEO? Look at her. She’s willing to throw away everything for a man.”</p><p>Before Mr. Moretti could respond, Tracy suddenly spoke up.</p><p>“Father,” she said sweetly, “why don’t you let Collins meet Mr. Damien instead.”</p><p>The room froze.</p><p>Every head turned toward her.</p><p>Because everyone knew Collins. And everyone knew he couldn’t negotiate.</p><p>They would be no way he would survive a single serious meeting with someone like Mr. Damien.</p><p>Even Collins was shocked. He leaned toward Tracy and whispered sharply, “What are you doing?”</p><p>Tracy didn’t look at him. She smiled faintly and whispered back, “This is your chance. Prove yourself right. If you succeed, you can hijack the CEO position with this.”</p><p>Collins’ heart pounded. He thought about it for barely a second.</p><p>Then he stepped forward eagerly. “Yes. Yes, Father. Please give me a chance. Let me meet Mr. Damien. I can handle it.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti didn’t hesitate. He looked straight at him. “You can’t handle Mr. Damien. Even though you know that.”</p><p>Tracy immediately chimed in. “I will help him. I’m good at this. I have handled countless negotiations like this. I will teach him everything. You will be impressed.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti hesitated. He knew Tracy’s reputation. She was successful, sharp, and experienced. She had indeed sat through many high-level meetings.</p><p>Still, his brows furrowed with concern.</p><p>Collins pushed harder. “Father, if you don’t give me a chance, how will I ever learn? Serena has deserted the family and chosen a trash bag over us. You don’t have many options left.”</p><p>Allison nodded quickly. “Yes, Father. Give Collins a chance.”</p><p>The room fell into a tense silence as all eyes returned to Mr. Moretti, waiting for his decision.</p><p>Mr. Moretti coughed and agreed, “Okay, you will meet with Mr. Damien,  but you have to make no mistake, because we are to sign a Concession Agreement that would allow us to do anything in Winchester, don&#x27;t  fuck it up.”</p><p>Collins straightened immediately. Confidence flooded his face.</p><p>“I won’t fuck it up,” he said firmly. “Not even a little.”</p><p>Collins didn’t hesitate. He had already decided. “Then I want one thing if I succeed.”</p><p>The room leaned in.</p><p>“What is it?” Mr. Moretti asked.</p><p>Collins lifted his chin. “I will become the CEO. And I take full control of the Avalon Project.”</p><p>A low murmur rippled through the room. Shocked whispers followed. Some faces stiffened. Others turned toward Serena instinctively.</p><p>Mr. Moretti swallowed. Slowly, he looked at his daughter.</p><p>Mr. Moretti exhaled slowly, then turned back to Collins. “Fine. Do it. If you succeed, you will prove your competence. You will become the CEO and head the Avalon Project.”</p><p>Collins’ lips curved into a satisfied smile. He glanced at Serena and smirked openly.</p><p>Serena’s jaw tightened. Anger flashed in her eyes.</p><p>Without a word, she turned, grabbed Charles by the arm, and dragged him out of the room.</p></div>
