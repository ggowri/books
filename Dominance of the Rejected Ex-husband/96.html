        <h1>Chapter 96</h1>
        <div><p>The garage fell into a dead silence, thick enough to choke on. Lizzypie’s crossed arms and narrowed eyes said it all—she knew Charles never made a move without proof.</p><p>Tracy, however, was boiling over. &quot;What is this nonsense? I came here to buy stones, I was given stones, and now you&#x27;re claiming they&#x27;re empty?&quot; she spat, her voice trembling with rage.</p><p>&quot;Every last one of them,&quot; Charles stated, his voice cold and flat. &quot;There isn&#x27;t a single gem in this entire shipment.&quot;</p><p>A smug staff member stepped forward, folding his arms. &quot;Who do you think you are, spouting nonsense like that? If you&#x27;re not here to do business, get out!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No!&quot; Tracy shrieked, jabbing a finger at Charles. &quot;I don&#x27;t know him! He&#x27;s insane – just trying to ruin me! He can&#x27;t stomach the thought of my success!&quot;</p><p>Charles let out a short, harsh laugh. &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, Tracy, use your head for once. If you sell these, you won&#x27;t just lose your money—you&#x27;ll destroy your reputation. When your customers crack these open and find nothing, they&#x27;ll never trust you again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shut up! Just shut up, Charles!&quot; she screamed, her face turning crimson. &quot;Stop projecting your miserable failures onto me! You cling to women to get anything done, and now you&#x27;re trying to drag me down with you out of spite! You divorced me over a stupid misunderstanding, and now instead of apologizing, you&#x27;re trying to destroy my life!&quot;</p><p>Lizzypie rolled her eyes. &quot;It&#x27;s always about you, isn&#x27;t it? Even when he&#x27;s trying to save your neck.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stay out of this, you whore! You&#x27;re in this together! How could he possibly know they&#x27;re empty without cutting them open? He can&#x27;t! It&#x27;s all lies!&quot; Tracy yelled, her voice cracking.</p><p>That&#x27;s when Wilson, the CEO, decided to step in, his voice slick and threatening. &quot;Sir, I won&#x27;t tolerate you slandering our business. Our stones are legitimate.&quot;</p><p>Charles turned his icy gaze on him. &quot;I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m not buying. Give me my money back. She can do what she wants.&quot; He jerked his head toward Tracy.</p><p>Wilson smirked, shoving his hands in his pockets. &quot;I&#x27;m afraid you don&#x27;t understand how this works. A deal is a deal. The money is ours.&quot;</p><p>A deep frown etched itself on Charles&#x27;s face. &quot;That&#x27;s not a problem. I&#x27;m voiding the deal. Give. Me. My. Money.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t make this difficult,&quot; Wilson sighed, the fake patience in his voice wearing thin. &quot;Take your stones and leave.&quot;</p><p>A flicker of doubt finally crossed Tracy&#x27;s mind. Any reputable company had a return policy. Charles hadn&#x27;t even touched his shipment. Why was Wilson refusing?</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The sound echoed through the garage. Charles had snatched one of Tracy&#x27;s stones and smashed it on the concrete floor. Nothing.</p><p>Wilson scoffed. &quot;You expect every rock to have a gem? You clearly know nothing about this business.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know exactly what I&#x27;m doing,&quot; Charles said calmly. &quot;I&#x27;ll pay for every one I break.&quot; He picked up another.</p><p>Crack. Empty.</p><p>Crack. Empty.</p><p>He smashed ten stones in rapid succession. All empty. Tracy felt the blood drain from her face. He was right.</p><p>As he reached for the eleventh, Wilson&#x27;s voice cut through the air. &quot;Stop. Now. Get out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said I&#x27;d pay for the broken ones. You have nothing to worry about.&quot; The truth was now undeniable. Ten duds in a row.</p><p>Suddenly, Wilson&#x27;s demeanor shifted. The slick businessman vanished, replaced by a cold, cruel smirk. &quot;Fine. You want the truth? They&#x27;re all fake. Every last one. And there&#x27;s not a damn thing you can do about it. Pack up this garbage and resell it. Maybe you&#x27;ll get pennies back.&quot;</p><p>Tracy gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. Ten million dollars. Gone.</p><p>&quot;Just give us our money, and we&#x27;ll go,&quot; Charles said, his voice dangerously low.</p><p>Wilson laughed. &quot;Go to hell. We only sell the real stuff to people who matter. We scam people like you for a living. And you can&#x27;t touch us. Because we&#x27;re the Titans.&quot;</p><p>On cue, his men pulled out guns, the metallic clicks echoing in the space. Muzzles pointed at them from every direction.</p><p>Lizzypie and Charles stood perfectly still, but Tracy began to shake uncontrollably.</p><p>&quot;Pick up your worthless rocks and get out,&quot; Wilson snarled. &quot;Or I&#x27;ll have my men paint the walls with you.&quot;</p><p>Tracy, sobbing, started frantically waving at her truck driver to load the stones. But Charles didn&#x27;t move a muscle.</p><p>He took a step forward. &quot;You think this is how you do business? Let me make something clear. I&#x27;m not leaving without my money or the real stones I paid for.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think this is a game?&quot; Wilson sneered.</p><p>BANG! BANG!</p><p>Two shots rang out, hitting the ceiling. Plaster dust rained down.</p><p>&quot;The next ones go in your skulls. Get out,&quot; Wilson threatened.</p><p>&quot;Charles!&quot; Tracy wailed, tears streaming down her face. &quot;Let&#x27;s just go! We&#x27;ll call the police! They&#x27;re going to kill you!&quot;</p><p>Charles acted as if he hadn&#x27;t heard her.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ll leave you here! I swear I will! You&#x27;re going to get yourself killed, and I won&#x27;t care! Please, let&#x27;s just go together!&quot; she begged, her voice raw with terror.</p><p>Wilson chuckled. &quot;Seems the little lady cares about you. You should listen to her.&quot;</p><p>Charles finally looked at Tracy. &quot;Go. Don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;ll get your money back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you insane?&quot; she cried, her face a mess of tears and confusion. &quot;Look around! They have guns! You don&#x27;t have to prove anything to me! I know... I know you still love me, okay? I get it now! Please, don&#x27;t throw your life away for this!&quot;</p><p>Charles simply nodded. There she was again, making it all about her, about a love that had died long ago. Lizzypie couldn&#x27;t hold back a derisive snort.</p><p>&quot;Charles, please... don&#x27;t be so childish, I don&#x27;t want you to die,&quot; Tracy whispered, her whole body trembling.</p><p>Charles looked at her, she looked terrified and genuine. She was crying seriously.</p><p>With that, Charles did the unthinkable.</p></div>
