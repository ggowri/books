        <h1>Chapter 176</h1>
        <div><p>Mr. Damien snapped his head toward his bodyguards, rage twisting his face. “Hold her for me,” he barked. “I will crush that hand today.”</p><p>The guards moved instantly.</p><p>Before they could reach Serena, a sharp voice cut through the chaos. “What the hell do you think you are doing?”</p><p>Everyone turned.</p><p>The crowd parted as a tall figure strode forward. Charles stepped into view, his expression dark and controlled. </p><p>At that moment, Serena felt a rush of relief. Finally, someone had come that would stand with her.</p><p>Charles moved closer, placing himself in front of her. His eyes locked on the bodyguards. “Touch her,” he said coldly, “and I swear you will lose your fingers.”</p><p>The guards hesitated and were intimidated by his aura. </p><p>Mr. Damien’s eyes narrowed as he recognized him. His jaw tightened. He muttered under his breath, “What is this motherfucker doing here?”</p><p>He turned sharply to Mr. Moretti. “Who is he to you?”</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s face was stiff. At this point, he was exhausted. Nothing was going his way anymore. </p><p>Serena did not wait for him to answer.</p><p>She stepped forward and wrapped herself around Charles, holding him tightly. “He’s my fiancé,” she said loudly. “We are getting married next week.”</p><p>Mr. Damien looked stunned. His gaze snapped back to Charles, then to Mr. Moretti. “Really?” he asked slowly.</p><p>Collins immediately jumped in, eager to stir the fire. “Yes, Mr. Moretti,” he sneered. “This is the same useless thing who begged your son for money and even assaulted him. This is him. My sister’s fiancé.”</p><p>People began to whisper again.</p><p>“That’s him.”</p><p>“The one from that incident.”</p><p>“He still has the nerve to show his face here?”</p><p>What they didn’t know was that Mr. Damien’s anger deepened as the bad blood between them already past that. </p><p>Mr. Damien stepped forward, his voice low and dangerous. “What the hell do you think you are doing here?”.</p><p>Charles added calmly, “Someone who will make you lose everything.”</p><p>Collins let out a mocking laugh, eager to ride Mr. Damien’s favor. “That’s all he does—bluff. Big words, empty pockets.”</p><p>Allison added coldly, “He’s just a poor orphan. Someone like him would never leave Serena because of our family’s wealth.”</p><p>Collins nodded, enjoying the moment. “So poor he even begged your son for money. He has nothing. Nothing at all. Just noise.”</p><p>Mr. Damien frowned slightly as his eyes stayed on Charles. Though he got to know of Charles because of Sapphire’s incident, he could feel there was something more to him.</p><p>Still, he scoffed.</p><p>“You think someone like you,” Mr. Damien said slowly, “someone less than an ant I can crush under my shoe, can threaten me?”</p><p>Charles said loudly so everyone could hear. </p><p>“I will  say it again,” he said. “I am the one who will make you lose everything. And it has already happened.”</p><p>Laughter burst out across the hall.</p><p>A man scoffed loudly. “Do you even know Mr. Damien’s net worth? It can buy your entire bloodline.”</p><p>Mr. Damien laughed with them, shaking his head in amusement. He opened his mouth to respond when his phone started ringing.</p><p>Charles tilted his head slightly and said calmly, “Well? Pick that up.”</p><p>Mr. Damien frowned slightly. The call bothered him more than he wanted to admit. Charles was too confident.</p><p>Collins scoffed. “His phone is ringing, and so? Stop acting cool or something. It’s cringe.”</p><p>Mr. Damien shot Charles a cold look. “My phone ringing has nothing to do with whatever nonsense you’re saying.”</p><p>Charles didn’t move. “Well,” he said evenly, “pick it up and you will know.”</p><p>The room fell into an uneasy silence. Serena’s eyes stayed fixed on Mr. Damien. So did everyone else’s. Charles’s confidence was unsettling..</p><p>Mr. Damien scoffed again and finally answered the call. “Hello?”</p><p>A frantic voice of one his subordinate exploded from the other end. “Sir! Your secret warehouse—the one where you keep most of your assets has been discovered and seized by the police!”</p><p>Mr. Damien’s eyes flew open. His head rang. “What… what are you saying?”</p><p> “It’s true, boss. Both warehouses were hit. A man got there first, beat everyone, then called the police. Boss… everything is almost gone.”</p><p>Mr. Damien’s legs shook. Even without hearing the words, everyone could tell something terrible had happened.</p><p>He roared into the phone. “Where is Razor?!”</p><p>There was a pause. Then the answer came. “Sir… reports say he’s dead. The man killed him. Witnesses say… it was like lasers came from his eyes.”</p><p>“Also, most of our men have been arrested!”.</p><p>Mr. Damien nearly lost his balance. Those two warehouses held seventy percent of his property.</p><p>Slowly, he lifted his gaze and locked eyes with Charles.</p><p>Charles was smirking.</p><p>Mr. Damien ended the call with shaking hands. “You,” he said hoarsely. “You were the one?”</p><p>Charles nodded calmly. “At your pleasure.”</p><p>The crowd erupted in murmurs.</p><p>“What did he do?”</p><p>“He really got Mr. Damien. What was the call about”</p><p>Mr. Damien forced a laugh, though his face had gone pale. “Your mistake is relying on the police,” he sneered. “They respond to me. I control them. Everything will be returned. I own Winchester.”</p><p>Charles smiled faintly. “Not this time.” He paused, then added, “And there’s more to come.”</p><p>At that moment, Mr. Damien’s phone rang again.</p><p>Mr. Damien stared at Collins as he answered the call with trembling fingers. “What the fuck is it now?”</p><p>This time, it was his secretary.</p><p>Her voice came out rushed and panicked. “Sir—sir, the companies have been hit by the prosecutor.”</p><p>Mr. Damien stiffened. “What do you mean, hit?”</p><p>“They seized everything,” she said quickly. “All offices have been locked down. All accounts have been frozen. Everything happened at once.”</p><p>Mr. Damien’s chest tightened. “Why?” he snapped. “On what grounds?”</p><p>There was a brief pause, then she started informing him, “They uncovered illegal activities. Slush funds. Tax evasion. Document forgery. Coercion. Drug trafficking. Human trafficking.” Her voice dropped. “And… there are rape allegations too.”</p><p>Mr. Damien’s breathing turned heavy. His vision blurred. He could not deny it. He had done and buried those things carefully. </p><p>“But… How is this public?” he demanded. “How did this get out?”</p><p>The secretary swallowed audibly. “That’s the worst part, sir. It’s spreading fast. The news already has it. Victims are coming forward to testify. One after another.”</p><p>Around him, people had gone silent. They watched his face drain of color.</p><p>The secretary continued, her voice shaking. “Investors and shareholders have pulled out with immediate effect. The stock has crashed.”</p><p>Mr. Damien whispered, “Crashed?”</p><p>There was a pause that felt endless.</p><p>“Yeah, we are now at Zero,” she said. “The stock value is currently zero.”</p><p>Mr. Damien’s lips parted. “What… what does that mean?”</p><p>Her answer came softly, almost pitying. “It means you are bankrupt, sir. You have nothing to your name”</p><p>The phone slipped from his hand and hit the floor.</p><p></p></div>
