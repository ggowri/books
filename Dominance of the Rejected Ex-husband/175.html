        <h1>Chapter 175</h1>
        <div><p>Everyone was shocked and stunned when the sound of a slap rang out. Heads turned instantly and the music was turned down at once. Because, the person who had been slapped was none other than Mr. Damien. Eyes widened in disbelief around the room.</p><p>Mr. Moretti was also shaken. He yelled at his daughter, “What the fuck did you do, Serena? Apologize to Mr. Damien immediately!”</p><p>Mr. Damien still held his cheek in agony while three of his bodyguards had already closed in.</p><p>Serena shouted back at her father, “Why should I apologize? He got what he deserved. Why would he grab my ass? This old fool.”</p><p>“Me… old fool, after you slapped me?” Mr. Damien muttered in disbelief.</p><p>“Yes,” Serena said without backing down. “Maybe I should repeat it. You are a big old fool. You shouldn’t even be allowed in society with that kind of behavior. A stupid pervert. Try that again and I will give you another slap.”</p><p>Mr. Damien then turned to Mr. Moretti. “Is this what you subjected me to by inviting me here? For what your daughter has done, I am cutting all my support. Consider your Winchester project gone. It will not happen.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti was shaken. He had already spent a fortune, and with Mr. Damien’s influence in Winchester, nothing would move forward without his support. Nothing. Fear tightened his chest.</p><p>He immediately lowered his head. “I am sorry, Mr. Damien. I sincerely apologize.”</p><p>Mr. Damien’s eyes hardened. “No. You are not the one who should be apologizing. Your daughter is. She dared slap me!”</p><p>Serena scoffed. “Do you even listen to what you are saying? You grabbed my ass first. How could you do something like that? And you still have effrontery to talk”</p><p>Mr. Moretti yelled, “Serena, what are you doing? Apologize right away!”</p><p>“Father,” Serena said, her voice breaking with anger. “When did you turn into this? You want me to be treated anyhow just because you want to gain something from him? You know what he did.”</p><p>Collins stepped in folding his arms. “Serena, why are you being so arrogant? You slapped Mr. Damien and now you are accusing him of grabbing you?”</p><p>“You better shut up if you don’t know anything,” Serena snapped. “He grabbed my ass.”</p><p>Allison chimed in. “Sister, what evidence do you have that he did that? Stop throwing accusations around”</p><p>“Because Father witnessed it,” Serena said. She turned to Mr. Moretti. “Father, tell them. Tell them that this freak grabbed my ass first and deserved the slap.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti gulped as every eye in the room turned to him.</p><p>Serena’s voice cut through the silence. “Why are you hesitating? Tell them now.”</p><p>Mr. Damien folded his arms slowly and waited, his gaze fixed on Mr. Moretti. It was calm, confident, and dangerous.</p><p> Mr. Moretti knew that look too well. If he testified against Mr. Damien, the endorsement would be gone. The Winchester project would collapse overnight.</p><p>Yet every eye in the room was now on his daughter.</p><p>If he lied against her, people would tear her apart. They would come for her and call her a woman who used false accusations to cover violence. His chest tightened as the weight of the choice pressed down on him.</p><p>Mr. Moretti heaved a shaky breath. His hands trembled as he had to choose between his legacy or daughter. </p><p>Mr. Damien pushed harder. “Talk, Mr. Moretti. Now. Did I do that?”</p><p>The room went still.</p><p>Mr. Moretti finally exhaled and said quietly, “No. I didn’t see anything.”</p><p>“What?” Serena gasped.</p><p>The whispers started instantly.</p><p>“So she was lying,” someone murmured.</p><p>Another voice followed. “She slapped Mr. Damien and still threw such a serious accusation.”</p><p>“This is a disgrace,” someone else added. “A shame to the entire Moretti family.”</p><p>Each word felt like a slap to Serena’s face. She turned to her father slowly, her eyes wide as if she were staring at a stranger.</p><p>“Father…” Her voice broke. She could not believe it.</p><p> He abandoned her, and lied, right there. In front of everyone.</p><p>Collins smirked and stepped forward. “Serena, that’s enough. Just apologize and Mr. Damien will let things go. Don’t spoil the atmosphere.”</p><p>Mr. Damien straightened, growing bolder. He picked up a glass and held it out casually. </p><p>“Just pour me some wine as your way of apologizing. I understand. Someone must have brushed past you and you thought it was me. Let’s end things on a good note. Right?”.</p><p>Mr. Moretti shot Serena a pleading look. His eyes begged her to let it go.</p><p>“Yes,” someone said softly, “Take Mr. Damien’s generosity. It was just a misunderstanding.”</p><p>But, Serena didn&#x27;t budge.</p><p>Collins stepped forward eagerly, his voice sharp with opportunity. “This is exactly why you don’t deserve our family and why you can never lead it. You are arrogant, violent, and a liar. And even now, you refuse to apologize.”</p><p>Allison shook her head. “Such a shameful act.”</p><p>Whispers rippled through the hall.</p><p>“What is she still standing there for?”</p><p>“She’s been given a chance to redeem herself.”</p><p>“Will she really stand her ground on such accusations?”</p><p>Serena exhaled slowly and dropped her shoulders. She reached for the nearby wine bottle.</p><p>Mr. Moretti smiled in relief. </p><p>Mr. Damien lifted his glass, a dirty smirk curling at the corner of his mouth as he waited for her to pour.</p><p>Serena raised her hand. Just then—</p><p>Sprrrrrrrrrr!</p><p>She tilted the bottle and poured the wine straight over his head.</p><p>Everyone froze.</p><p>Mr. Damien was instantly soaked in red liquid dripping from his hair to his expensive suit.</p><p>Everyone&#x27;s jaws dropped.</p><p>“What the hell?!”</p><p>“She poured wine on him!”</p><p>“Is she crazy?!”</p><p>“What the fuck!”</p><p>No one could believe what they had just seen.</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s eyes bulged in horror.</p><p>Serena stood tall, the empty bottle still in her hand. “How’s that?” she said coldly. “You asked me to pour you wine, and I did. You psycho pervert.”</p><p>Mr. Damien&#x27;s eyes, filled with anger, he bursted, “I swear, I will kill you!”</p><p></p></div>
