        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div>Charles had to step aside because of what Serena said.<br/>Meanwhile the man wouldn’t stop; he was doing everything to touch Tracy. Everyone watched the commotion—even Mr. Vasilios. They all knew who the man was.<br/>Cynthia fumed in anger and managed to kick the man away.<br/>“I will kill you!” the man growled.<br/>Clueless Derek didn’t know who the man was; all he knew was that the man was disturbing the peace.<br/>This was the best time for him to turn the humiliation he had suffered into something heroic. He wanted to prove himself in front of everyone.<br/>“Hey, mister! You are disturbing the peace of everyone here. Now leave!” Derek shouted.<br/>“It’s none of your concern, fool. Get away from me!” the man snarled and shoved him.<br/>Derek flew back, then sprang up and kicked him. “How dare you push me away and cause trouble at Mr. Vasilios’s party? I’m going to teach you some lessons.”<br/>The man stood up and threw punches at him, but Derek—surprisingly—was a little skilled. He dodged and delivered a hard kick in return.<br/>The man landed on one of the tables and crashed, causing a commotion.<br/>Everyone started praising Derek.<br/>“Look at him. He isn't afraid at all!”.<br/>“Derek is really surprising me. How could he fight someone like that?”<br/>He smiled to himself, soaked in smug relief.<br/>The man staggered up. “Do you know who I am? That you’re beating me? You better have finished everything here before I arrived.” He stormed out of the hall angrily.<br/>Derek turned to the guests, chest puffed. “You shouldn’t worry. There’s nothing he can do. I knocked sense out of him—he just scraped away.”<br/>Mr. Vasilios walked closer, and Derek smiled with pride, sure he was about to be praised.<br/>Smack.<br/>Smack.<br/>Two heavy slaps landed across Derek’s face. He clutched his cheek in stunned surprise.<br/>“What have you done? Do you know who that person is? Majik—the son of the Tiger Fang leader? How dare you anger him! Now he will come back with his goons to beat all of us!” Mr. Vasilios yelled.<br/>That was when Derek knew he had totally messed up. He knew about Tiger Fang and what they were capable of.<br/>Just then Majik emerged and stood in the doorway. “You are dead! All of you are in trouble.” A car screeched to a stop outside. Thugs poured out, rushed in, and bowed to Majik.<br/>Derek turned pale, shivering. The thugs were far too many for him to face.<br/>“Where is all that bragging? I told you I am going to kill you if I return,” Majik said, eyes cold.<br/>One guest stammered, “Uhm… Majik, we don’t know anything about this. You should deal with only him.”<br/>Mr. Vasilios immediately chimed in and nodded. “Yeah, yeah… take him away. We don’t know him at all.”<br/>Majik smirked and pointed at the crowd. “You were all watching him beat me and couldn’t even stop him. Especially you, Mr. Vasilios! You really disappoint me. I came to your party only to get beaten. Everyone here is doomed!”<br/>Everyone started blaming Derek.<br/>Derek immediately dropped to his knees and began begging. “Please… please, I’m sorry! I was stupid. I didn’t know who you were!”<br/>Smack! Majik kicked him hard in the chest, sending him sprawling. Derek clutched his stomach, still begging through the pain.<br/>Majik sneered. “It seems you finally know your place. Good. I won’t waste another punch on a dog like you.”<br/>Derek gasped, trembling, and muttered, “Thank you… thank you…”<br/>Majik turned from him with a cruel grin and strode straight to Tracy. He licked his lips slowly. “Now, my love… back to where we were. Will you let me touch your butt now?”<br/>Tracy froze, trembling, cornered and speechless.<br/>Majik’s hand hovered toward her, fingers curling greedily.<br/>That was when Janet’s voice rang out, sharp as a whip. “Stop! Why do you keep molesting her?”<br/>The hall fell into stunned silence.<br/>Janet stepped forward, eyes blazing. She could not stand idle. Known as a fierce feminist and a leader in anti-alpha-male protests, she could not watch a woman being assaulted—no matter Majik’s bloody history.<br/>“You can’t treat women like property. Not here. Not in front of me,” she said, voice steady.<br/>Mike and Mr. Vasilios tried to stop her. “Don’t interfere,” they hissed. “They are animals. They will hurt you.”<br/>Janet screamed back, “We have to teach men like him a lesson. Why is he going this far just to molest her?”<br/>Majik scoffed, paused, then fixed Janet with a leering look. “Then should I touch you instead? You look sexy too.”<br/>He moved toward Janet. “Let me touch your butt!”<br/>Janet backed up, frightened.<br/>Just then, Derek grabbed Majik’s arm. He saw it as another chance to win back Mr. Vasilios’s favor and prove his courage.<br/>“Wow, I can see you’re still acting cool because I haven’t knocked some sense into you,” Majik blurted.<br/>“Please… please… stop this already,” he pleaded, trying to calm the mess he helped create.<br/>Majik motioned to his goons. Two rushed Derek, kicked him, and started stomping him until his face was bruised and bleeding.<br/>Majik turned back to Janet. “Get your butt here. Let me see if it’s soft.”<br/>Tracy stepped between them and cried, “Please leave her… it’s me you want! What more do you want from me? Leave innocent people alone!”<br/>Majik faced Tracy. “You. I want you—just for tonight—or everyone here will face the consequences.”<br/>“O… okay,” Tracy stammered.<br/>“That’s a great decision,” he said, grabbing her hand as if to drag her away. “I will fuck you till you faint.”<br/>Everyone watched, helpless; Cynthia lay cowering; Janet was about to intervene, but Mr. Vasilios clamped a hand over her mouth to silence her.<br/>“Stop right there!” a voice suddenly called out across the hall, heavy and urgent.<br/>Majik turned to see who had spoken. <br/>It was Charles. Even though Serena had tried to stop him, he couldn’t watch Majik molested Tracy.<br/>“Uhn! Who are you—are you one of her lovers?” Majik sneered.<br/>At that moment Charles stepped forward from the crowd. “What if I am?” he said, calm and dangerous.<br/>Tracy stared at Charles in disbelief as he stood between them, ready to teach Majik a lesson.<br/>“Go away now, while I’m still nice,” Charles warned.<br/>Majik laughed, venomous. “Oh, are you trying to be a hero too? Come on…let me teach you a lesson!”</div>
