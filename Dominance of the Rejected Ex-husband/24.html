        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div><p>The first bodyguard lunged, a fist flashing toward Charles’s face. Charles didn’t flinch, his body shifted almost instinctively. The blow whistled past his cheek, and his elbow shot forward, ramming into his ribs. </p><p>A hollow crack echoed, and the guard staggered back, wheezing.</p><p>The second guard came at him immediately, arms raised, trying to grapple him down. Charles bent low, his eyes narrowing, and the world seemed to slow. </p><p>Satan’s eye activated. </p><p>He saw every twitch of muscle, every strained vein in the guard’s neck. Time stretched; in that suspended moment, Charles felt utterly calm. </p><p>His fist clenched, his knuckles whitening, then drove upward like a piston into the man’s chin. </p><p>Crack!!!.</p><p>The bodyguard’s head snapped back, his legs buckled, and he collapsed to the ground with a groan.</p><p>Both men writhed at his feet. The crowd gasped, whispers cutting through the air like sharp knives.</p><p>Derek’s face contorted with disbelief. “Why are you so useless?” he snapped at the fallen guards.</p><p> “Two men, and you can’t even handle one beggar?” His voice cracked with fury, but deep down, fear gnawed at him.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey clutched at her pearls, her face pale, eyes wide in shock. “What… what kind of brute are you?” she hissed.</p><p>The onlookers leaned in closer. Murmurs spread.</p><p>“Who the hell is this guy?” someone whispered.</p><p> “He took down two guards like it was nothing.”</p><p> “But look at him… he’s just a poor man. Look at his clothes!”.</p><p>“What the hell is he doing here!”.</p><p>Charles stood tall, his chest heaving, his eyes smoldering with a quiet rage. </p><p>Derek’s sneer faltered. His throat went dry, and he swallowed hard.</p><p> He had seen Charles fight before. This wasn’t a man he wanted to fight. He knew Charles would beat him like a baby.</p><p>Instead, he tried to cover his fear with bluster. “Charles… what are you doing?” His voice trembled despite his effort.</p><p> “This is a high-profile party, and you are… you’re disrupting everything. Do you even know where you are?”</p><p>Charles ignored the scattered whispers and the shifting stares of the guests. His eyes locked on Derek, then slid to Mrs. Hailey. </p><p>He slowly walked towards them. An invisible aura of power radiated from him, making people unconsciously step back, including Derek.</p><p>“What… what do you want?” Derek stammered, his earlier arrogance stripped away.</p><p>Charles’s expression did not change. His gaze bore into Derek’s, stripping him bare. He was about to smack him when a voice hauled from behind.</p><p>“What the heck is happening here!”.</p><p>They all turned at it, and it was no other person than Mr. Moretti himself, the master of the estate, stepping forward in his tailored black suit.</p><p>His presence carried weight—an aura of power built on years of dominance in the business world. Even before he spoke again, the guards bent low, bowing in shame for having failed in their duties. Their faces burned red with embarrassment.</p><p>Derek immediately bowed,  Mrs. Hailey too lowered her head.</p><p>Mr. Moretti had risen from nothing to build his company into one of the biggest empires in the country. Every titan of industry respected him. His name carried power in both the boardroom and the streets.</p><p> Yet beneath the wealth and glory, his family was crumbling, though none of the public knew. He hid that truth carefully, and today was no exception.</p><p> Tonight, his daughter’s birthday wasn’t merely a celebration, it was a stage for cementing new partnerships, alliances worth billions. Derek was among those carefully chosen partners, and Moretti valued all his partners. </p><p>He had planned this night meticulously. He wanted perfection. No scandals. No fights. And now, seeing this disruption firsthand, he had stepped out himself.</p><p>“Sir!” Derek immediately seized the moment, pointing at Charles like a snake exposing prey.</p><p> “I am one of your partnerships you will be signing today. But this man, this useless beggar…is causing trouble!”</p><p>The crowd stirred. Eyes turned from Derek’s proud bow to Charles’s ragged figure. Mr. Moretti’s gaze swept over Charles slowly, from his worn clothes to his calm face. </p><p>“He looks exactly as you say,” Moretti said flatly. “Poor. Worthless. Someone give this man some money and escort him out at once. He should not disgrace such an event.”</p><p>Laughter broke out among some of the guests. </p><p>Charles remained unmoved. His chest rose slowly, his eyes hard as stone. Then he spoke.</p><p>“Sir… I was invited here today.” </p><p>The crowd erupted with whispers.</p><p>“Invited? Him?”.</p><p>“Impossible.”.</p><p>“He must be delusional.”</p><p>“Who would invite a man like that?”</p><p>Derek pounced. “Then where is your card? Even the most prestigious guests today had to bring their invitation cards. Show us yours!”</p><p>Charles’s lips curved into the faintest smile. “I was invited by Ms. Serena herself. If you doubt me, you can ask Captain Fred.”</p><p>The murmurs grew louder, more vicious.</p><p>“Serena? He’s mad.”</p><p>“Why would the young most beautiful  heiress invite someone like him?”</p><p>“He’s lying. Just look at him.”</p><p>“A shameless trickster trying to climb higher than his place.”</p><p>All eyes burned into Charles with scorn and disbelief. Everyone was mocking him.</p><p>Mr. Moretti was highly angry because of this. Her daughter was an image of power, high class and status. If she really gets associated with someone like him, it would be a great disappointment to everyone. Her image as a refined, high class standard woman would be shattered. </p><p>Mr. Moretti’s sharp gaze cut through the noise. </p><p>“You said my daughter herself invited you? And yet you bring no invitation card?” He paused, letting the crowd drink in the accusation. </p><p>“You must have been scammed. Even if she did invite you, which I doubt…for what purpose?”</p><p>Charles let out a long breath, steadying himself. His lips tightened before he finally answered.</p><p>“I came here to give Ms. Serena a birthday gift.”</p><p>For a second, silence. Then Derek barked out a mocking laugh.</p><p>“A gift? Look at him!” He waved his hand at Charles’s worn clothes.</p><p> “The whole outfit on his back costs, what, two hundred dollars at best? And this man dares talk about giving Ms. Serena, a Moretti heiress…a gift?”</p><p>The crowd erupted in cruel amusement.</p><p>“He must be insane.”</p><p>“A gift from him? What could it be, a cheap trinket from the roadside?”.</p><p>“This is beyond embarrassing.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey stepped forward, venom dripping from her tone.</p><p>“Charles, you truly must have lost your mind. Serena wouldn’t even stand in the same room with you, let alone accept anything from your hands. Much less a gift. What nonsense is this?”</p><p>Charles’s eyes flared, but his voice remained calm, “The value of a gift does not come from its price. It comes from the intention behind it.”</p></div>
