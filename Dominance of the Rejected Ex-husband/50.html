        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div><p>Tracy was shocked hearing Charles say he knew the Godfather. The Charles she knew was a poor orphan, a man who came into her life with nothing. Through their marriage, she was the one carrying expensive things, not him.</p><p>If he really knew the Godfather, then he was supposed to be a rich, powerful man. Her face tightened in confusion. She frowned and asked again,</p><p>“You really know him? How?”</p><p>Charles opened his mouth to answer…</p><p>But then, voices echoed from behind them.</p><p>“Tracy!”</p><p>“Charles!”</p><p>They turned quickly and saw Derek rushing toward them. Beside him was Mrs. Hailey, and behind them Serena. At the back came LizzyPie and Fred.</p><p>Derek ran straight to Tracy with an over-concerned face. He grabbed her shoulders.</p><p>“Are you okay? Did they touch you? Tell me now before I order them to destroy this whole place!” he shouted, speaking like some important fellow.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey added, “Daughter, hope you are perfectly fine, uhn?”</p><p>Tracy only nodded. “Yes… I’m fine, Derek, Mom.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Charles’s eyes caught Serena. He was surprised to see her here. He also noticed how terrified she looked when she was rushing toward him, like she was worried. But in an instant her face turned cold. She stopped in front of him, her gaze sharp.</p><p>“What are you doing here? You are my fiancé. You should stay away from fights and commotions that can attract the public!”</p><p>Charles lowered his head slightly. “Sorry… I was just saving someone.”</p><p>“Your ex-wife?!” Serena’s tone cut deep. “I heard she left you, and yet here you are, risking yourself to save her?”</p><p>Charles looked at Tracy, then back at Serena. &quot;She is in danger partly because of me. I couldn&#x27;t just stand by.&quot;</p><p>Serena’s eyes narrowed. “So does that mean… you both still love each other?”</p><p>Charles froze. The question stabbed him. He and Serena were only a fake couple, a cover… but why was she asking such a thing as if it mattered to her?</p><p>He gulped. “Like I said… because I punched Tiger at the banquet, they’re retaliating against her. So I’m here to save her. That’s it.”</p><p>The reason Tracy wanted to protect him? He didn’t know either.</p><p>Serena’s face softened for a moment. She let out a cold sigh. “Hope you are fine,” she said quietly.</p><p>Charles nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>Then LizzyPie stepped forward. She looked him up and down, her voice blunt.</p><p>“You still have a lot to work on. They really beat you up, you really disappointed me.”</p><p>Charles clenched his jaw. He didn’t want to hear more. He immediately grabbed LizzyPie’s hand and dragged her a little away from the group.</p><p>Making sure no one could hear, he hissed, “Hey, what do you think you’re doing? Did you call the Godfather? You know I will be disqualified from getting the inheritance if I ask for his help!”</p><p>She sighed and folded her arms under her chest, lifting them higher. “I’m not that dumb like you. Running here to save someone that left you for another guy! Well, listen. Godfather said you shouldn’t ask him for help directly. But that rule doesn’t count if someone else asks. So I persuaded Serena to ask her father to call Godfather. Since Godfather wants you with Serena, when he sees she was the one begging for you, he will be impressed. He will help you without canceling your trials.”</p><p>Charles blinked, finally understanding. “So… Serena was the one who called Godfather to save me?”</p><p>LizzyPie nodded. “Yeah. She was panicking. I can bet she’s really in love with you. I just pushed her to call her father and do anything to contact Godfather, knowing well she’d do it.”</p><p>Charles sighed in relief. He had thought LizzyPie herself called Godfather, which would have ruined him. But it was Serena. He scoffed at LizzyPie’s words, though. To say Serena was “in love with him” sounded crazy. He believed she only did it because she cared.</p><p>He was about to say more when Tracy walked toward them. Charles turned to her and asked, “Are you okay?”</p><p>She nodded. “Yeah, I am fine. And I can see you are fine too. That’s why we have to give our gratitude to Derek.”</p><p>Charles frowned. “What do you mean by that?”</p><p>“Actually,” Tracy said simply, “Derek called his father and asked Godfather to help us. That’s the reason his troops are here. You should thank him.”</p><p>Charles couldn’t believe it. He turned and stared at Derek, who was now standing proudly, grinning and waiting for thanks. He glanced back at LizzyPie. The troops were here because Serena called for help, not Derek. Derek was lying to take the credit.</p><p>Charles scoffed. “Really, Derek? Your father called Godfather? Who is your father? And how can he call him?”</p><p>Derek folded his arms. “Does all that matter? You should just be grateful you are alive because of me. So just thank me.”</p><p>Charles shook his head. “I can’t do that. Godfather’s troops are here, but not because of you. Your father didn’t do anything.”</p><p>Derek’s face darkened. “Why are you denying it? How do you even know? I called my father because Tracy’s mother was so scared for her daughter. Then my father worked on it. That’s the reason you were saved!”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey quickly supported him. “Yeah, yeah… Derek really put in the job!”</p><p>Charles refused to give in to the blatant lie. “No. I won’t thank him for what he didn’t do. He should stop lying.”</p><p>Tracy suddenly burst out, her voice sharp.</p><p>“Why are you like this?! This is the reason I divorced you! You always act like you’re something. Just moments ago you were lying that you knew the Godfather, claiming that’s why he was here. Now Derek has caught your lies, and you still refuse to believe. Just thank him…it’s nothing hard!”</p></div>
