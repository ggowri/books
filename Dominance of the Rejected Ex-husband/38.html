        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div>Everyone waited patiently, almost eagerly, ready to ridicule Charles. They were certain he was about to present something unworthy.<br/>Just then, Lizzypie walked into the ballroom. She wore a very short, off-shoulder gown that revealed the upper curves of her chest and made her hips look wider.<br/>Everyone who saw her couldn’t help but gasp. Lizzypie had the kind of figure that always made people look twice.<br/>She stepped forward to Charles and bowed slightly. “Sir… this is it,” Lizzypie said with respect.<br/>This made Derek even angrier. How could such an alluring, sexy woman show respect to Charles? He wished it was him instead.<br/>Serena frowned a little at the scene, and so did Tracy.<br/>“What is this… did you hire a prostitute to make an impression? Is that what Ms. Janet would cherish?” Derek sneered intentionally, his jealousy and annoyance clear.<br/>Lizzypie scoffed and blew him a kiss. In her hand was a large square object wrapped in thick brown paper.<br/>She handed it to Charles.<br/>“What is that? I’m sure it’s just some cheap painting! You want us to stand here, decipher its so-called meaning, and pretend it holds some stupid value? Hah! That’s exactly what poor people always do,” Derek mocked.<br/>Another person chimed in, “Yes, I’ve seen this many times. Mr. Derek is right—a cheap artwork with forced meaning. Nonsense!”<br/>Meanwhile, Janet scoffed, but her curiosity still showed. “Let’s see what’s inside, then.”<br/>Charles placed the frame down and carefully unwrapped it. After peeling away the wrapper, he lifted it and revealed it to Ms. Janet and Mike.<br/>Everyone leaned in, eager to see.<br/>It was a hand-drawn painting—an incredibly detailed, lifelike image of Ms. Janet and Mike. The craftsmanship was so fine that despite being hand-drawn, it looked strikingly real.<br/>In the drawing, Janet and Mike stood beside a man seated in the middle, smiling. Every stroke carried precision and meaning.<br/>For a long moment, the crowd studied it in silence.<br/>Then Derek scoffed loudly. “What… What is this? What nonsense is this? You just drew the couple, so what? You think you’re the first person to ever do that?”<br/>Another person added, “In fact, they could have the most popular artist paint them. So this is nothing special.”<br/>Then Mike began walking slowly forward, his eyes fixed on the painting. His voice trembled as he said, “My… my dad. It’s my dad. He drew my dad in the picture with the two of us in it.”<br/>His face lit up with sudden joy, a happiness so raw it silenced the room. He hurried closer, staring at the drawing as though he were seeing a miracle.<br/>“How stupid I am,” Mike said, his voice thick with emotion. “I didn’t even think about it. How foolish of me to forget my late father. But seeing him here… it’s like he is alive, smiling at us, happy for us, babe.”<br/>Janet’s eyes widened. She reached for his hand, overcome by the tenderness in his words.<br/>Meanwhile, Derek was baffled. He couldn’t understand how this was supposed to be special.<br/>Mike carefully collected the painting from Charles, holding it as if it were priceless. His eyes glistened. “I’m so happy with this. I swear, I could buy this for ten million dollars!”<br/>What no one else in the room knew was that Charles had planned this moment carefully. He didn’t have the wealth to impress with luxury. So instead, he researched what mattered most to the celebrant.<br/>Scrolling through Ms. Janet’s social media, he saw endless posts about Mike, her beloved fiancé. What Janet cherished most was clearly Mike.<br/>Then Charles dug deeper into Mike’s own posts—tweets and photos filled with grief and memories of a man who meant the world to him: his late father.<br/>Ten years ago, Mike’s father had died in a fire outbreak, sacrificing himself to save his son. Because of this, Mike cherished his father’s memory deeply and often wrote about how much he missed him.<br/>Charles knew this was the one thing money could never buy back. So instead of wasting resources on something shallow, he asked Lizzypie, who had an extraordinary talent for drawing to create a portrait that brought Mike’s father back into the picture, literally.<br/>And just as Charles predicted, the impact was overwhelming.<br/>Mike raised his brows, his face glowing. “Bro, I love this so much. Let me buy it for ten million dollars!”<br/>“What? Ten million dollars?” Gasps rippled through the room.<br/>That was an insane amount for a portrait. Mike must really cherish his father that much.<br/>Even though the money could have been life-changing for Charles, he tried to play the situation wisely. He simply nodded.<br/>“No, I didn’t do this for money. It’s just a gift from me to you and Ms. Janet. I hope you love it,” he said.<br/>“Yes, yes! I love it. You drew it so well. It’s amazing and you are even giving it for free. You’re astonishing,” Mike said, smiling so much it was infectious.<br/>Janet had never seen her fiancé this happy. She looked impressed.<br/>Charles then turned to her. “So, ma’am… can you tell us what you cherish most here, among all these gifts?”<br/>Derek trembled a little and cut in. “It’s… a good idea, what you did. But my two-million-dollar shoes are worth more than just a portrait you brought.”<br/>Mike snapped, “Shut up! It’s not just a portrait…it’s a memory. You ignorant fool!”<br/>That was when Derek realized he had screwed up. He had just angered Mike.<br/>Then Charles faced Ms. Janet. “Now, your judgment.”<br/>Janet hesitated. She understood that Charles had played this moment perfectly, and she was impressed. In fact, what she cherished most was clear. But Derek had spent two million dollars on shoes, and she knew admitting Charles impressed her more would make Derek bark like a dog.<br/>“Babe,” Mike called to her softly, smiling.<br/>At that moment, Janet knew what she had to do. She followed her heart.<br/> “What I cherish most in this world is my fiancé. He always stands by me and protects me. And Mr. Charles just made him smile like this. I have never seen him this happy before. So I must say… Mr. Charles impressed me more, and I cherish what he brought the most.”<br/>Serena couldn’t help but smile faintly, proud of Charles.<br/>Everyone started murmuring.<br/>Derek stammered, “But… but I bought two-million-dollar shoes! They’re the most expensive!”<br/>Janet shook her head. “You’re wrong! What someone cherishes most is not measured by how expensive it is, but by how your heart reacts to it. You can take your shoes back. I don’t want them.”<br/>“Fuck,” Derek muttered.<br/>Charles smiled. Now this was his moment. He stepped forward. “So… what are you waiting for? Bark.”</div>
