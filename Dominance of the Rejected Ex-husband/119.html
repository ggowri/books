        <h1>Chapter 119</h1>
        <div><p>Charles was puzzled, muttering, “Natasha…?”</p><p>Natasha’s eyes widened. “Charles…?”</p><p>He frowned, confused about why she was here in Mr. Damien’s house, but he didn’t say anything yet.</p><p>Mr. Damien, surprised but excited to see Serena, stood up quickly.</p><p>“Serena! You didn’t tell me you were coming,” he said with warmth.</p><p>Serena bowed slightly, her expression tight.</p><p>“Yes, Uncle… I just have some questions you must answer.”</p><p>Uncle Damien blinked, confused. “What questions? What must I answer?”</p><p>Serena inhaled deeply.</p><p>“Did you send thugs to assassinate me?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Uncle Damien’s eyes widened, pure confusion written across his face.</p><p>“What the fuck are you talking about?” he barked, genuinely shocked.</p><p>Serena stepped forward, voice trembling with anger.</p><p>“Uncle, I am trying my best to believe the same also, there is absolutely no reason you would want me dead… but explain this.”</p><p>She signaled Charles.</p><p>Charles stepped forward, opened his phone, and showed him:</p><p>The payment receipts</p><p>The chat logs with Zander</p><p>Audio notes</p><p>The confirmation of a hired kill order</p><p>Uncle Damien scoffed loudly.</p><p>“I don’t know who the hell this is. They are trying to frame me. Someone is framing me!”</p><p>He strongly denied it.</p><p>Charles squinted, something feeling off. Just then he noticed some strange movement from Uncle Damien.</p><p>He immediately activated the Soul Sight, peering  5 seconds into the future.</p><p>He saw it, Uncle Damien grabbing a hidden gun behind his back and firing directly at Serena’s head. He was going to kill her. </p><p>Charles snapped back to reality just in time.</p><p>The moment Uncle Damien’s hand moved behind him, Charles lunged.</p><p>As Damien pulled the gun out, Charles’ hand slammed into his wrist, stopping the shot, twisting the weapon away.</p><p>The gun clattered across the floor.</p><p>Charles then delivered a fierce punch into Damien’s jaw, knocking him backward.</p><p>Thud!!!.</p><p>Blood sprayed from Damien’s mouth as he hit the wall before falling down.</p><p>Serena gasped and was so shocked. She stood frozen, her whole body trembling. Her mind couldn’t process it.</p><p>Her uncle, the man who always smiled at her, patted her head, praised her and even protected her, had just tried to kill her. After her father, this was her most precious person.</p><p>“U-uncle…” she whispered.</p><p>Charles didn’t stop. He stepped forward, grabbed Damien by the collar, and with one brutal punch in his face.</p><p>PAAK!</p><p>Damien’s head snapped sideways, blood spraying.</p><p>Charles punched him again</p><p>THUD!!</p><p>Damien slumped to the floor, groaning but still conscious.</p><p>To incapacitate him completely, Charles pressed his foot on Damien’s right arm, twisted it. </p><p>CRACK!</p><p>Damien screamed.</p><p>“YAAAA!!! FUUUCK!!”</p><p>His bones snapped, leaving the arm limp and useless. He only panted heavily, glaring at Charles.</p><p>Serena walked toward him slowly, her “Uncle… Uncle… how…how could you do this to me?”</p><p>Her voice broke.</p><p>“Why did you want to kill me? You… you were always the nicest person to me.”</p><p>Damien spat blood at the floor and barked, “Fuck you… and fuck your father.”</p><p>Serena flinched hard.</p><p>Damien hissed, voice filled with years of resentment.</p><p>“Moretti is to blame for all this! My own brother betrayed me!”</p><p>Serena’s eyebrows pulled tight in confusion.</p><p>Damien growled louder.</p><p>“We built that empire together from scratch! I let him take the lead because he was my older brother. But I was involved in EVERYTHING! I made sacrifices and worked together with him. And now… he wants to pass the inheritance to YOU!”</p><p>Serena shook her head slowly.</p><p>“So you want me dead… because of inheritance?”</p><p>Then she added, “You think if I die he will give it to you?”.</p><p>Uncle Damien scoffed, “No. He will give it to Collins at most. That stupid child is gullible and  easy to control. I can pull strings behind him. BUT YOU…”</p><p>He pointed a shaking finger at her.</p><p>“You are stubborn. Smart. Difficult. You will ruin everything for me. If the company goes to you… I will lose everything.”</p><p>Serena’s hands dropped to her sides. Her eyes reddened, but words refused to come out.</p><p>“You could’ve talked to me,” she whispered. “I would have found a solution… I would have done something”</p><p>“You wish!” Damien snarled.</p><p>His eyes rolled toward Charles suddenly and sneered.</p><p>“And YOU—”</p><p>Charles narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“You are just like your father,” Damien said, voice dripping with spite.</p><p>Charles’s entire body stiffened.</p><p>“…What,” he said quietly, but dangerous. “You know my father?”.</p><p>Charles grabbed Damien by the collar immediately, yanking him up hard.</p><p>“What the fuck are you saying?” Charles barked into his face.</p><p>Damien smirked despite the pain, blood dripping from his mouth.</p><p>“Your father… would be so disappointed,” he croaked. “You are with the wrong woman, a woman you should be enemy with, you are making the same mistake… just like him.”</p><p>Charles’s grip tightened. “What the hell are you talking about? Speak clearly!”</p><p>Damien’s smile widened, right after that, he started jerking off</p><p>Glup… glup…</p><p>His eyes rolled as he started choking.</p><p>“Hey— hey!” Charles shouted, shaking him. “What are you doing!”</p><p>Damien’s jaw clenched unnaturally.</p><p>Blood seeped between his teeth.</p><p>He was biting something on something.</p><p>Damien crushed whatever was in his mouth and spat out a thick, dark blood. His body stiffened, eyes wide and blank.</p><p>And then he collapsed to the floor.</p><p>Dead.</p></div>
