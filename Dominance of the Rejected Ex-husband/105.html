        <h1>Chapter 105</h1>
        <div><p>The room fell into a heavy silence after Norman was dragged out. No one moved. No one spoke. The air felt thick with shame and awkward relief.</p><p>Mr. Edward exhaled slowly, then walked toward Charles and Serena. He stopped in front of them and bowed slightly, his voice low and remorseful. “</p><p>I’m sorry,” he said. “I accused you wrongly and humiliated you in front of everyone. I shouldn’t have done that. That bastard poisoned my mind.”</p><p>Charles said nothing. Serena only stared at him.</p><p>Around the room, people exchanged nervous glances. Everyone knew what Serena’s name meant—Businesswoman of the Year, a woman whose words could open or close doors for anyone in that room.</p><p> Many of them had said cruel things only moments ago, and now they feared the consequences.</p><p>One woman stepped forward first, forcing a shaky smile. “I—I also apologize for the stupid thing I said earlier. That bastard, Norman, twisted all of us.”</p><p>Another followed quickly. “Yes, I’m sorry too. I spoke out of line.”</p><p>A man near the back added, “I said some things I shouldn’t have. Please, forgive me.”</p><p>A fourth voice joined in, desperate to be heard. “We were deceived. Norman tricked all of us.”</p><p>Serena lifted her chin slightly. “It’s okay,” she said, her tone even. “I understand. That stupid Norman is the one to be blamed.&quot;</p><p>Then someone near the table said, “Well, I think someone owes Miss Serena and Mr. Charles a proper apology.” </p><p>Heads turned toward Derek and Mrs. Hailey.</p><p>Another voice supported him. “That’s true! They are the ones who claimed they also saw Charles take the watch. Maybe they were accomplices with Norman. They should be thrown out too.”</p><p>Derek’s face went pale. His eyes reddened from the pressure, embarrassment cutting through him like fire. “No, no, it wasn’t like that,” he stammered. “We thought—we thought we saw him pick something up. We were wrong. It was Mr. Norman we saw, not Charles.” He twisted it.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey nodded frantically, words tumbling from her mouth. “Yes, yes, that’s true. We saw Norman and mistook him for Charles. We were stupid. Please, forgive us.”</p><p>Mr. Edward’s expression hardened. “Since you both now realize your wrongs, apologize properly. Kneel down.”</p><p>Gasps cut through the air. Derek froze, humiliated. Mrs. Hailey’s hands trembled.</p><p>Tracy’s voice broke the silence, sharp and furious. “Kneel down? My mother cannot kneel down!”</p><p>All eyes turned to her. </p><p>Serena’s voice was calm but cutting, her eyes locked on Tracy. “You were here when they were saying they saw something that didn’t happen. You even joined them and insulted Charles. Now it’s time for them to apologize, why shouldn’t they kneel?”</p><p>Tracy’s jaw tightened. “Mr. Edward accused him too,” she muttered. “And he only bowed. Why should they kneel down?”</p><p>Serena turned to her slowly, her tone sharpening. “Because they didn’t just accuse him. They bore false witness. They claimed they saw him do it. That’s different. Their words could’ve gotten him arrested, Tracy. They deserve far more than just kneeling down.”</p><p>The crowd murmured in agreement.</p><p>“She’s right,” one man said.</p><p>“Exactly—false witnesses deserve shame,” another added.</p><p>“They nearly ruined him,” someone else muttered.</p><p>Mr. Edward nodded firmly. “If they can’t kneel down and apologize, then they should just leave. Right now.”</p><p>Tracy’s face burned red with anger. She clenched her fists. “Mom, Derek, let’s go.”</p><p>But Derek caught her arm gently, his voice low. “We shouldn’t… not yet.” He leaned in, whispering, “We still have something left to do here. Please, let us just kneel.”</p><p>Tracy hesitated, shaking her head. “But—”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey placed a trembling hand on her daughter’s arm. “I understand,” she said softly. “Let’s just do it.”</p><p>With that, both Derek and Mrs. Hailey sank to their knees on the polished floor, heads lowered. Their voices trembled as they spoke in unison, “We apologize for our mistake. Please forgive us.”</p><p>The room was silent except for the echo of their words.</p><p>Charles looked down at them, detached, almost disgusted at the two dirty being. “Okay,” he said simply. “I forgive you.”</p><p>They stood up slowly, eyes down, their legs shaky and their cheeks flushed. </p><p>The organizer clapped his hands and forced a strained smile. “Alright, everyone,” he said into the mic, “let’s not let a few people ruin the evening. The misunderstanding’s over—let the party continue!”</p><p>Music rose again from the speakers. The lights shifted. Waiters hurried back and forth with trays. Slowly, the tension broke apart. People began laughing again, chatting, pretending nothing had happened.</p><p>Charles and Serena were immediately surrounded—well-wishers, business partners, guests eager to repair damaged bridges. Smiles flashed, glasses clinked, and the scent of champagne filled the hall.</p><p>Across the room, Tracy stood alone, as she crossed her arms and her jaw tight. She couldn’t bring herself to join the others. Every laugh, every compliment toward Serena burned in her chest.</p><p>Upstairs, in the unused women’s washroom, Mrs. Hailey stood before the mirror, splashing cold water on her face. The usual restroom was occupied, and she had slipped into this one to be alone.</p><p>The door creaked open. Derek stepped in, closing it quietly behind him.</p><p>“Derek?” she said, startled. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>He leaned against the sink, his face hard but his voice low. “The same thing you’re doing. Trying to breathe after that humiliation. You can’t handle it either, can you?”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey sighed, rubbing her temples. “That Charles… he always comes out on top. Always.”</p><p>Derek gave a small, bitter laugh. “I know. And I’m the fool who helped Norman and testify. I shouldn’t have said a word.”</p><p>She nodded grimly. “We both shouldn’t have said anything.”</p><p>Derek’s eyes darkened with something sharper than regret. “Don’t worry,” he said. “Charles’s glory will be short-lived. Tonight isn’t over yet.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey turned to him. “I really  can&#x27;t  for everyone to see the sex tape”</p><p>He smiled faintly. “That will make sure no one remembers our embarrassment but his. He will surely be on the newspaper front page by tomorrow”. He grinned. </p><p>Mrs. Hailey nodded. Then she saw Derek unzipping his trousers.</p><p>“What are you doing!”.</p><p>“What do you think, let fuck our embarrassment away. I am so horny right now. Strip!”  He prompted.</p></div>
