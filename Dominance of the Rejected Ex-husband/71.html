        <h1>Chapter 71</h1>
        <div>Norman took the stone with pride and walked back to his seat, but when he arrived in front of Charles, he stopped and taunted,<br/>“You are absolutely nothing compared to me! So don’t even try—and stop bluffing.”<br/>Charles just stared at him calmly and said,<br/>“Well, congratulations on your stone,” he added simply.<br/>Norman scoffed and walked away while everyone applauded him.<br/>Meanwhile, the auctioneer rushed to someone beside the stage, collected something, and hurried back. He cleared his throat and announced,<br/>“I’m sorry, that was supposed to be the last item, but there is this grey stone we found among the relics, and we would like to auction it. Although, honestly, we don’t think it’s of high value. It’s so light, we should have even thrown it away—but we just want to put it out there.”<br/>Everyone looked at the stone on display, and those who could read stones well immediately recognized it as worthless. Everything about it screamed normal, empty, and insignificant.<br/>“Mmchew… do you want to rip us off? This is some nonsense stone,” someone muttered.<br/>“Let’s go already,” another hissed.<br/>The auctioneer pressed on, “Anyone… anyone would like to buy it? Starting at 300 dollars.” He glanced around, dejected. No one raised a hand. Really, who would spend money on just a stone?<br/>“300 dollars!”<br/>Someone shouted—and everyone’s eyes turned toward him. It was none other than Charles.<br/>Serena was the first to burst into laughter and tickled him, exclaiming,<br/>“Charles! That stone contains nothing!”<br/>Charles smirked and said,<br/>“You don’t know.”<br/>Everyone burst into laughter.<br/>“Isn’t that the man who was bragging and bidding high against Mr. Norman?”<br/>“Ha! He doesn’t even have any money with him!”<br/>“Someone said he just made Mr. Norman bid so high!”<br/>“He definitely doesn’t even have 100 million!”<br/>The crowd murmured and laughed, some shaking their heads in disbelief at Charles’s audacity.<br/>The auctioneer tried to regain order. “Sold! 300 dollars, sold to that man!”<br/>Norman suddenly stood up, glaring at Charles. His voice rang out, sharp and scornful.<br/>“Everyone, look at him! He’s useless, nothing but a joke! He can only afford a 300-dollar stone—an empty stone infact”<br/>Tracy muttered under her breath, “This Charles… he’s crazy.”<br/>Charles ignored the mockery. He calmly went up to the stage and made his payment to collect the stone.<br/>Once he had it, he pressed it gently between his two palms.<br/>The crowd murmured in confusion.<br/>“What is he doing?”<br/>“Crazy man…”<br/>All eyes were on him, the laughter slowly dying down, replaced by curiosity. <br/>Charles pressed the grey stone between his palms and then it cracked, breaking into pieces.<br/>Everyone laughed.<br/>“Yeah! That’s it! Look at the useless stone you bought!”<br/>“Stupid! What a waste!”<br/>Charles calmly dusted the fragments away and reached into the pile. He pulled out a small, black stone. <br/>The crowd froze. Every eye was on him.<br/>“What’s that… what is he doing?”<br/>“It’s like a gemstone inside that grey thing!”<br/>“Another stone? What’s happening here?”<br/>Without a word, Charles placed the small black stone under the limelight.<br/>“Is he crazy?” someone whispered.<br/>Norman hollered, voice cracking with fury,<br/>“What the f*** are you doing?!”<br/>Then it happened.<br/>The stone began to shimmer. Light poured out of it, soft at first, then brighter. It pulsed, almost breathing. A faint, eerie bleeping sound emanated from it, sending shivers down everyone’s spine. There was a big aurora coming out of it.<br/>“What the f*** is that? What’s happening? That stone… it’s activating!”<br/>The auctioneer stood frozen, shock written across his face.<br/>Thum… thum… thum.<br/>The stone began making a rhythmic sound, like a heartbeat.<br/>Lizzypie gasped, recognition flashing in her eyes. “That bastard…” she muttered.<br/>Serena leaned in, whispering to herself,<br/>“Isn’t that… the symptom of the Nytheris Stone? What’s happening here?”<br/>Just as she said it, someone else shouted,<br/>“That’s it! That’s the Nytheris Stone! Look! It’s breathing! The stone is alive!,. this is the stone!”<br/>Everyone pressed closer, mesmerized, eyes wide as the light continued to shine, pulsing with life.<br/>Norman stood frozen, staring at his own stone.<br/>He muttered under his breath, disbelief and panic mixing,<br/>“What is happening here…?”<br/>The signs were undeniable. These were the symptoms of the Nytheris Stone. The stone in Charles’ hand was undeniably nytheris stone!.  But the one in his hand, the one he had spent ten billion dollars on… what the heck is it then.<br/>His jaw tightened as his mind raced. Something wasn’t right.<br/>Charles left the small black stone under the spotlight and then, impossibly, it began to float. With no one holding it.  <br/>Gasps erupted around the room.<br/>“Wow, that is incredible!”.<br/>It was unmistakable now. The stone was nytheris.<br/>Charles reached out and caught it effortlessly.<br/>Norman’s face twisted in rage. He couldn’t hide it anymore. He roared, his voice shaking the hall,<br/>“What the fuck is happening here?! Isn’t that the Nytheris Stone? That surely is it! Then what the hell did you sell me?!”<br/>He stormed toward the stage, fists clenched, eyes blazing.<br/>“What is all this?! You better give me that stone right now! It belongs to me!”<br/>Charles didn’t flinch. He just smirked.<br/>The truth was, though no one could see it yet. From the moment Charles had laid eyes on the first “supposed” Nytheris Stone, his eyes of Satan had revealed the truth: it was empty. There was nothing inside. A painted, counterfeit stone, designed to look valuable.<br/>Meanwhile, the real Nytheris Stone had been quietly tucked away, hidden in the corner where Charles could observe its every breath, its every shimmer. He had known all along which stone was real and which was fake.<br/>Every outrageous bid he had made, every taunt and bluff against Norman… it had all been intentional. Every dollar Norman spent chasing the empty stone, every escalation, had been part of Charles’s plan. Charles made him overspend on a worthless, painted stone.</div>
