        <h1>Chapter 142</h1>
        <div>Charles reached the hotel as fast as he could. He walked straight to their suite, and pushed the door open. Lizzypie was waiting on the couch, with a laptop in front of her searching for something.<br/>“Lizzypie,” Charles said as he shut the door. “What’s the mission?”<br/>She placed the phone beside her and leaned back slowly. “Well, It’s difficult this time, since you have reached the third mission, it will be so hard from now on”<br/>Charles didn’t sit. “How difficult?”<br/>Her gaze sharpened. “He wants you to drag  a billionaire down. A very popular one. And collect his company.”<br/>Charles blinked. “What? A billionaire?” His voice dropped. “I should drag a billionaire down and still take his company? Is Godfather helping us this time? Will use his influence”<br/>Lizzypie shook her head lightly. “Uhn. Godfather already warned you. No more assistance. He gave you three free ones, and you wasted them on that ex-wife of yours.”<br/>Charles rubbed the back of his neck and groaned. “So, who is the billionaire?”<br/>She answered quietly, as if the name itself carried weight. “Mr. Damien. From Winchester Town.”<br/>Charles froze.<br/>His mouth hung open, jaw slack. He’d heard that name more times than he could count. Even though Winchester was far away from them, Mr. Damien’s influence spread like smoke. Everyone talked about him and how wealthy he was. He even owns two private airports. <br/>“That man…” Charles whispered. “He’s bigger than Mr. Moretti. I heard that. How am I supposed to do this?”<br/>Lizzypie shrugged a little, though her eyes stayed serious. “Well… that’s for us to figure out.”<br/>Charles swallowed hard. “But why would Godfather want something like that? For me to drag one of the richest men in the region down—”<br/>Lizzypie cut in sharply. “Not only that.”<br/>Charles looked at her.<br/>She leaned forward, her voice low and steady.<br/>“He said you should kill him too. With your own hand.”<br/>Charles halted, staring at her like she had just spoken a different language. “Are you fucking kidding me? I should kill Mr. Damien? After I drag him down and take over his company, how the hell is that even possible?”<br/>Lizzypie lifted her shoulders in a small, helpless shrug. “I’m shocked and surprised as well.”<br/>Charles ran a hand over his face. A sharp regret pricked his chest, that he should have just accepted his normal wealth, lived a quiet life, and forgotten all this madness. The mission to become the next Godfather was more harder than he thought.<br/>He stopped pacing. “Why did Godfather even want this? I should kill someone… why?”<br/>“It’s not in my position to question,” Lizzypie replied calmly. “Same as you. But I can tell you this…Godfather has his reasons for everything. If he asked you to kill Mr. Damien, I’m sure the reason behind it is very big.”<br/>Charles let out a long breath. “Okay… okay, so how are we going to do this?”<br/>Lizzypie shook her head. “I don’t know yet. But we need to do our research on him first, before knowing what to do next.”<br/>-<br/>“Fuck,” Charles muttered under his breath. He finally sat beside Lizzypie, who was already deep into her research.<br/>“Look at this,” she said, turning the screen toward him.<br/>Mr. Damien’s profile filled the display.<br/>He was the CEO of CHENG Enterprises, a massive corporation focused on researching and creating advanced chemicals and developing new technology. His portfolio was stacked with achievements. He was so rich that aside from his main company, he owned two airports, two hotels, and several large stadiums. He had a wife, children, and a reputation that looked almost spotless.<br/>“There’s not even a speck of scandal on him,” Lizzypie said. “He created a lot of helpful things too. Like that new developed wheelchair thing… the one that lets disabled people walk. And all those AI cars and robots.”<br/>Charles stared at the list of achievements and scoffed. “He’s a fucking hero. And an aspiring influential leader. Why would Godfather want him dead?”<br/>Lizzypie didn’t look up. “I told you. It’s none of our business.”<br/>Charles leaned closer. “Also, he’s bigger than I even thought. Airports, chemical and engine manufacturing… and so much more. How are we supposed to take that over?”<br/>Lizzypie couldn’t even respond. The mission was huge, she couldn’t deny it. Then she finally said, “Let’s go to Winchester tomorrow and get more interactive information. So we can learn more about him.”<br/>Charles sighed and nodded. “Okay. That’s great… Thanks, Lizzypie. I don't think i can thank you enough”<br/>Lizzypie gave a small, indifferent shrug. “I’m just doing my job, Charles.”<br/>Then her lips curved into a slow, knowing smirk. “But if you really want to thank me enough… why don’t you ease my stress?”<br/>Charles blinked, caught off guard. “Oh… okay. You want a massage? Or I could run you a bath—”<br/>But she was already standing in front of him. In one smooth motion she pulled her dress over her head and let it drop. Her bra followed, then her underwear. Until she stood completely naked in front of him. <br/>Charles’s throat went dry. He’d seen her naked before, but every single time felt like the first. The curve of her waist, her big heavy breast and her pink firm round nipples always make him lose it. <br/>Lizzypie stepped closer, planted one foot on the couch beside his thigh, and opened herself to him without shame. Her pussy was already slick, pink, and swollen.<br/>“Please,” she whispered. “Can you lick me till I cum?”<br/>Charles swallowed hard. His throat gulped already dry to taste it. <br/>He slid off the couch and onto his knees in one motion, hands settling on her hips. “With pleasure.”</div>
