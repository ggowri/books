        <h1>chapter 129</h1>
        <div>Lizzypie scoffed and said, “Charles… you know we have to finish him. If we don’t, he will come back.”<br/>Charles hated that option. He hated killing,  the idea of shedding blood.<br/>“I already crippled him,” he said. “That should be enough.”<br/>Lizzypie glared. “Why are you taking her side? Because you slept with her?”<br/>Charles clenched his jaw. “It’s not about that. Killing him will make everything worse. It will drag us into a mess we can’t clean up.”<br/>Lizzypie groaned and turned away. “Fine. Do whatever you want.” She walked out of the room and slammed the door behind her.<br/>Charles sighed.<br/>Tracy muttered, “She’s a psychopath. How can she be that cruel?”<br/>She looked at him with judgment. “And you too… you have changed. You have become violent. She changed you. That’s why you should have come back to me.”<br/>Charles rubbed his face. “Just shut up, Tracy.”<br/>A few minutes later Norman was dragged out,  and handed over to the police along with the video Tracy recorded.<br/> The recording had everything — Norman threatening them, attacking them, even when he touched Lizzypie inappropriately.<br/>Tracy also posted it, circulated it, did every follow-up, pushing the video hard. It spread quickly.<br/>After giving their statements, Charles and Tracy stood at the intersection outside where their ways split.<br/>Tracy said, “Charles… You are a different person than before. Back there, you looked possessed.”<br/>“He assaulted Lizzypie,” Charles said. “I already told him I’d break his hand.”<br/>Tracy exhaled shakily. “We called it self-defense, but the police will still question you.”<br/>Charles nodded. “I will be okay. Don’t worry. And… Thanks for today. Goodbye.”<br/>He walked away.<br/>Tracy watched him, sighing, shaking her head with a strange mixture of pity and confusion.<br/>---<br/>The Next Morning<br/>Charles walked into the living room.<br/>Lizzypie sat on the couch, eyes glued to the TV.<br/>“You know,” she said, “I haven’t heard a single update about what happened last night.”<br/>Charles sighed. “It will take time—”<br/>“And all the videos you and Tracy posted were taken down overnight,” Lizzypie cut in. “ You can’t find any of it.”<br/>Charles frowned and immediately checked through his phone. All social media. <br/>It was true, the posts were gone. Completely wiped.<br/>Lizzypie crossed her arms. “And you know what that means. Norman is going to be released soon.”<br/>Charles stayed silent.<br/>“You don’t understand anything yet,” Lizzypie said. “If you are going to become the Godfather, you are going to face blood, a lot of it. You can’t keep shying away.”<br/>Charles gulped.<br/>Just then his phone rang. It was from Tracy.<br/>He frowned. Why was she calling again? Maybe to talk about the video.<br/>He picked it up.<br/>“Tracy?”<br/>Her voice came through in broken sniffles.<br/>“Charles… they are destroying … My company… they are destroying everything… please… help…”<br/> Charles squeezed his face, “Tracy, calm down. I’m on my way. Stay safe until then.”<br/>He grabbed his keys and rushed out.<br/>Lizzypie shouted behind him, “Told you! Norman won’t let this go! I told you!”<br/>Charles didn’t bother answering.<br/>He sprinted out of the door and made his way straight to Tracy’s company.<br/>×××<br/>Charles arrived at the Zenith Consortium and his chest tightened immediately. Just like Tracy said… everything was destroyed.<br/>Glass was shattered across the floor, the doors broken, computers thrown everywhere. Some security guards were sitting on the ground bleeding.<br/> Two policemen were taking statements, looking frustrated and helpless.Tracy sat curled in a corner, shaking, her arm bleeding.<br/>Charles rushed to her. “Are you okay..”<br/>The moment she saw him, Tracy jumped up and hugged him tightly.<br/>“Charles… you are here.”<br/>Charles let her stay like that for a second, then nudged her gently. “What happened? Was it Norman?”<br/>Tracy shook her head. “It’s… the Titan Family. From Wilson.”<br/>Charles’ eyes sharpened instantly.<br/>“We took his stone the other day,” Tracy continued, voice trembling. “He came back for revenge. He destroyed everything and said if I don’t give him 300 million dollars, he will kill me.”<br/>She wiped her eyes, but more tears fell. “He's already damaged so much…”<br/>Charles clenched his fists, anger burning fast through his veins. Tracy’s voice got smaller. “He also said he will come for you… and Lizzypie. He said he will kill you both… What are we going to do now? The police know it’s him but they aren’t doing anything.”<br/>Charles stood up.<br/>“Charles—?”<br/>He didn’t answer. He started walking away.Tracy stood quickly, panicking. “Where are you going!”<br/>“To meet him,” Charles said, “Warn him off… and collect money for the damage he caused.”<br/>Tracy’s voice cracked. “What! Are you insane? I just told you he’s finding a way to kill you! And you’re going to him yourself, making it easy for him?”<br/>Charles replied calmly, “I will be fine.”<br/>“Charles—don’t!” Tracy called again.<br/>But he was already gone.<br/>Charles arrived at the Titan Company and didn’t hesitate. He pushed the doors open and walked straight inside.<br/>The moment he entered, three guards spotted him. They recognized him instantly… the man who embarrassed their boss the other day.<br/>Their eyes darkened and pulled out knives. They stormed at him.<br/>The first guard lunged with a knife aimed at Charles’ ribs. Charles tilted his body to the side, grabbed the guard’s wrist, twisted it sharply, and slammed his elbow into the man’s jaw.<br/>The guard collapsed instantly.The second guard came from the right.<br/>Charles spun and delivered a clean kick to the man’s stomach, sending him crashing into a desk.<br/>The third guard rushed in wild, shouting.<br/>Charles caught his arm mid-swing, jerked him forward, and kneed him in the chest. The guard fell back gasping.<br/>He picked up one of the knives and  slashed  the last man with it in his tight. <br/>“Yaaaa!!!!”, He cried out pain <br/>Charles caught him by the shirt, lifted him slightly, and slammed him against the wall.<br/>The other staff watching was very horrified. <br/>“Get me your boss,” Charles growled. “Get me Wilson”.</div>
