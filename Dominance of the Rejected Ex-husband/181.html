        <h1>Chapter 181</h1>
        <div><p>The next morning, Mr. Damien’s death announcement circulated throughout the state.</p><p>The case was officially tagged as a suicide, as the commander-in-chief had already planned everything with Charles.</p><p>Because of this, Cheng Enterprises collapsed and was immediately put up for sale at one billion dollars.</p><p>Almost instantly, it was bought by a mysterious buyer. No one knew his identity, as everything was handled electronically.</p><p>Later that morning, Sapphire and the girls were already preparing to leave, packing their luggage.</p><p>Lizzypie and Charles stepped out of their room and saw them already packing.</p><p>Charles cleared his throat and said, “Uh… you’re already leaving?”</p><p>Sapphire nodded. “Yes. Since Mr. Damien is dead and his reign is over, thanks to you, there’s no need for us to stay here and be a burden.”</p><p>Lizzypie shook her head immediately. “No, not at all. You are not a burden.”</p><p>Amara and Tina were obviously sad about leaving. “We’ll miss you, Uncle Charles,” Amara said softly.</p><p>“And Aunt Lizzypie,” Tina added.</p><p>Both Charles and Lizzypie scoffed lightly. Then Charles said, “Uhmm… can we have a private talk with your aunt, if you don’t mind?”</p><p>Amara and Tina nodded. “It’s fine,” they said as they walked back into their room.</p><p>Sapphire watched them go, curiosity creeping in. Why would he send the girls away for a private talk? Her chest tightened. What’s happening? she wondered. “I hope there’s no problem”.</p><p>Charles smiled gently. “No. Everything is fine.”</p><p>Before Sapphire could say anything else, Lizzypie pulled out a paper and handed it to her. “Take this.”</p><p>Sapphire collected it and examined the contents. Her eyes widened in shock when she realized what it was.</p><p>It was a file of ownership for Cheng Enterprises.</p><p>Sapphire’s lips trembled as she stammered, “Th-this… this is—”</p><p>“Yes,” Lizzypie said calmly. “The ownership file of Cheng Enterprises. We are the ones who bought the company.”</p><p>Sapphire’s eyes widened in disbelief. “One… one billion dollars?”</p><p>Charles nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>At that moment, Sapphire couldn’t even begin to fathom how wealthy Charles and Lizzypie were. Her voice came out shaky. “Why… why are you giving this to me?”</p><p>They exchanged a brief look before Charles spoke. “We want you to have the Company. You can rebrand it, change the name, and become the new CEO. We will sponsor you with anything you need.”</p><p>Sapphire stood frozen, her mind spinning. “What… What do you mean? You’re giving it to me?”</p><p>Charles smiled. “Sure. You have always wanted to own your own engineering company.”</p><p>She shook her head slowly in denial.  “No… I can’t do this. Why would you give me something like this?”</p><p>Lizzypie stepped in gently. “You will be the one heading it and you will be giving us feedback as the executive owner when needed.”</p><p>She said it that way because she knew it was the only way Sapphire would agree without asking too many questions.</p><p>And it worked.</p><p>Sapphire was still shocked, but gratitude washed over her face. “Really,  wow … I will make it work. I promise. I will build a great company and handle it well.”</p><p>Her eyes glistened as a smile spread across her face. “Wow… I still can’t believe this.”</p><p>“finally!. Finally!!!!”. She cried out of joy.</p><p>[After two weeks].</p><p>Two weeks later, Sapphire had already rebranded the company as Aurelia Dynamics. Not long after, she launched her self-writing code program.</p><p>It became an outbreak.</p><p>Within weeks, the program spread across the globe, gaining billions of users worldwide. Ut became the most used AI alongside chatGPT and Grok. Behind the scenes, Charles heavily sponsored it, ensuring it reached every major market without drawing attention to himself.</p><p>Because of this success, Sapphire rose rapidly, becoming one of the top five richest people in the country.</p><p>The program reached everywhere, and with it, she inherited the legacy Mr. Damien once held—only this time, it was cleaner, stronger, and respected.</p><p>She also became the undisputed head of Winchester. Every major business there wanted to be associated with her, because they all knew one thing.</p><p>Just one partnership with Sapphire meant success.</p><p>That was the reason the Moretti family had gathered for a meeting.</p><p>The Avalon Project in Winchester had been brought to a complete halt after Mr. Damien’s death. He was meant to sponsor it, and without his backing, the project suffered heavy losses on their side.</p><p>Now, however, a new power had risen in Winchester.</p><p>Sapphire.</p><p>She was not only influential, but even bigger than Mr. Damien had ever been. The family saw this as an opportunity. If they could secure a partnership with her, it would change everything.</p><p>Seated in the room were Collins, Tracy, and Serena, who had recently returned, along with other members of the family.</p><p>Mr. Moretti finally spoke. “For the Avalon Project to succeed in Winchester, we need the partnership of Aurelia Dynamics.”</p><p>Almost immediately, Collins stood up. He saw this as another chance to secure his position as CEO.</p><p>“Father, let me handle this,” he said confidently. “I’ll go to them myself. I’m sure I can convince her.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti hesitated, his eyes shifting to Serena. She hadn’t said a word.</p><p>After a brief pause, he asked, “Can you really do it?”</p><p>Collins straightened. “I made the partnership with Mr. Damien possible. I can do this too. I’m capable. Besides, I’m the CEO. This is my responsibility.”</p><p>Tracy quickly chimed in. “Yes, give him the chance.”</p><p>Then, calmly, Serena spoke for the first time.</p><p>“I just hope you don’t blow it.”</p><p></p></div>
