        <h1>Chapter 164</h1>
        <div><p>“Who are you,” Charles asked again,  “Come out if you dare.”</p><p>The man stepped fully into the light.</p><p>He looked sharp,tall and broad with a long dark coat that looked heavy enough to hide weapons. His hair was neatly cut and his eyes were flat and calm like he had already measured the room and found nothing threatening.</p><p>He doesn&#x27;t look like those regular street thugs. He seemed more than that.</p><p>Lizzypie raised her own gun beside Charles. “Say your name,” she said. “Before your head gets blown off.”</p><p>The man smiled with just a thin curve of amusement in his lips.</p><p>“I’m Damien’s contact assassin,” He said evenly. “He paid me to kill you.”</p><p>Charles frowned slightly.</p><p>The man tilted his head. “I have other jobs waiting. So let’s make this quick.”</p><p>He was so confident.</p><p>Charles tightened his grip. “Good,” he said. “Let’s make it fast.”</p><p>He fired the gun at him. </p><p>Boom. Boom.</p><p>The shots were clean with perfect aim.</p><p>The man moved like it was nothing. </p><p>He weaved the bullet.</p><p>His body twisted between the bullets like he knew where they would be before Charles pulled the trigger. The rounds tore past him and shattered the wall behind.</p><p>Charles’ eyes narrowed. He was surprised by how fast he was. </p><p>Boom. Boom.</p><p>He shit again. </p><p>The assassin slid sideways dodging the bullet left and right, and surged forward at the same time. The distance vanished in a blink.</p><p>Charles knew then that this person was not ordinary. He was dangerous and someone like him. </p><p>He stepped back and shoved Lizzypie and Sapphire behind him with one arm. Then face back the assassin head on. </p><p>The assassin closed in like a shadow, his fists blurring as he threw the first punch—a sharp jab aimed at Charles&#x27;s jaw.</p><p> Charles ducked, weaving to the side just in time, his own fist swinging up in a counter hook. </p><p>The man twisted his body, dodging the punch with ease, and they circled each other, punches flying but missing by inches.</p><p> Charles threw a straight right, the assassin weaved left; the assassin jabbed low, Charles swayed back. It was like a deadly dance, both men reading each other&#x27;s moves.</p><p>But the assassin was faster. He pressed forward, breaking the rhythm. His left hook connected with Charles&#x27;s ribs.</p><p>Crack!!!</p><p>Followed by a right cross to the shoulder. </p><p>Charles grunted, staggering, but swung back. The man was already moving, landing punch after punch: left to the gut, right to the chest, left uppercut grazing Charles&#x27;s chin.</p><p> Charles blocked some, but the speed was overwhelming. He was struggling, breath coming in gasps, pain shooting through his body.</p><p>Charles&#x27;s eyes glowed.</p><p>[Eyes of Satan Activated]. </p><p>[Flash Movement activated]</p><p> But even then, the assassin kept up, his punches still landing: a solid hit to Charles&#x27;s side, another to his arm. Charles flashed away, reappearing behind the man, but the assassin spun and nailed him with a back fist to the face.</p><p>Charles stumbled back, blood trickling from his nose. He stood there, wiping it away, chest heaving. </p><p>&quot;Charles!&quot; Sapphire cried out, her voice sharp with worry. </p><p>Even Lizzypie called, &quot;You can&#x27;t defeat him&quot;</p><p>The assassin stood without a scratch, a cold smile on his face. &quot;This time, I will kill you without hesitation,&quot; he said. </p><p>[ Soul Sight activated]</p><p>Charles activated his own Soul Sight right then. Time slowed in his mind, he peered 15 seconds into the future, seeing the assassin&#x27;s moves. He analyzed it, mapping out the patterns, the weak spots.</p><p>But in those moments of focus, the real world didn&#x27;t wait. The assassin lunged, fists hammering into Charles—left to the jaw, right to the ribs, a knee to the stomach.</p><p> Charles doubled over, pain exploding, blood now from his mouth too.</p><p> The 15 seconds ticked by in his vision, but in reality, he was already beaten down.</p><p>Finally, the vision cleared. Charles caught the assassin&#x27;s incoming fist mid-swing, twisting it hard. </p><p>Now he had the upper hand for those next 15 seconds—he countered with a brutal elbow to the man&#x27;s face, followed by a knee to the gut that made the assassin grunt. </p><p>Charles flashed forward, landing a punch to the chest, then another to the side, driving the man back step by step. He weaved through a desperate counter and slammed a fist into the assassin&#x27;s shoulder, feeling the impact.</p><p>But the 15 seconds ended. The assassin recovered in a blur, faster than before. He grabbed Charles&#x27;s arm, yanked him forward, and unleashed a storm: punch to the face, kick to the knee that buckled Charles, elbow to the throat that choked off his air.</p><p> Charles hit the ground hard, vision blurring, blood pooling under him. The assassin loomed, foot raised to stomp, nearly ending it right there, Charles&#x27;s life flashing  in his eyes as the boot came down inches from his head.</p><p>Charles rolled away, gasping. He knew then—the man was so fast, and this Soul Sight was useless. During the processing period, the opponent had already beat the shit out of him.</p><p>Just then, the assassin stepped back, his hand glowing. An aurora formed in his palm, a swirling ball of energy, crackling with power. </p><p>Charles frowned; he had never seen physical power like this before. He had always seen it maybe on TV, those Chinese films, but this was really happening.</p><p>&quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot; Sapphire gasped, eyes wide.</p><p>The man smirked, the ball growing bigger, bigger, and bigger, pulsing with deadly light. &quot;You shall die now,&quot; he said.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>Poof!!!</p><p>A smoke tear gas canister dropped from above, rolling across the floor. Thick gray fog filled the room in seconds.</p><p>Then, Charles felt a gripped in his hand, it was Lizzypie.</p><p>“You can&#x27;t beat him, let go…”.</p><p>Then dragged him away, taking another exit</p><p> from behind.</p></div>
