        <h1>Chapter 132</h1>
        <div>As Charles snapped the briefcase shut.<br/> Mr. Eden and Mr. Jason stood stiff, sweat beading on their foreheads. Neither dared to look him in the eye.<br/>“Before I leave,” he said quietly, “you don’t tell anyone about my identity. Not your board. Not your wives. Not your sons. If you do…” he stepped closer, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper, “you will not like what happens to you.”<br/>Both men nodded so fast their necks almost cracked.<br/>“Y-Yes, Mr. Charles,” Mr. Jason stammered. “We will never mention it.”<br/>Mr. Eden swallowed. “We understand. We swear it.”<br/>Charles lifted the briefcase and walked out.<br/>Downstairs, the lobby went silent the moment he appeared. His steps were calm. Controlled. <br/>Wilson and Norman were standing again, still shaken. When they saw the briefcase in Charles’s hand… their jaws dropped.<br/>“What… the hell…?” Wilson whispered.<br/>Their fathers followed behind Charles like servants, heads bowed, eyes lowered as if escorting a king.<br/>Everyone stared. No one understood what was happening.<br/>Norman finally choked out, “What… what do you have on our fathers?”<br/>Charles didn’t even pause.<br/>“We will find it,” Norman said louder, anger cracking through his humiliation. “We will find it and when we do… we will kill you.”<br/>Charles stopped. He slowly turned his head just enough for them to see the cold in his eyes.<br/>“I should have listened to Lizzypie,” he said. “She told me to kill you when I had the chance.”<br/>Wilson’s eyes twitched.<br/>Charles stepped forward. “If you come near me again… I swear I will finish you off.”<br/>Wilson shouted, “YOU WON’T DO ANYTHING! —”<br/>“ARE YOU BOTH CRAZY?!”<br/>Mr. Jason’s roar cut him off.<br/>He grabbed Norman by the collar and slapped him.<br/>Smack!<br/>Mr. Eden slammed his palm across Wilson’s face.<br/>Smack!<br/>“SHUT UP!” Mr. Eden roared. “How many times must we warn you?!”<br/>Wilson staggered, shocked.<br/>Norman grabbed his burning cheek.<br/>Charles walked away without looking back.<br/>Wilson clenched his teeth. Norman looked confused, angry, and terrified all at once.<br/>Their fathers turned to them, fury shaking their voices.<br/>Mr. Eden snarled, “From today… you will neverget involved in my business again. EVER. Do you understand?”<br/>Wilson froze, stunned. “F-Father, what—”<br/>“Shut up!”<br/>He stormed off.<br/>Mr. Jason glared at Norman. “Follow me home. We are not done talking.”<br/>Both men marched out, leaving their sons confused, burning, furious.<br/>Everyone in the lobby whispered as the once-untouchable heirs stood alone, humiliated beyond repair.<br/>---<br/>Back at the company…<br/>Tracy stood in her office with her arms crossed, staring at the shattered glass, overturned chairs, and broken screens. The place looked like a war zone. <br/>When Charles stepped in, she whipped around.<br/>“Hey, how is it?”<br/>He set the briefcase on her ruined desk. “Your compensation.”<br/>Tracy scoffed. “Are you pranking me? Is this supposed to be funny?”<br/>He pushed the case open.<br/>Stacks of hundred-dollar bills filled the box.<br/>Her jaw loosened. “What… the actual… hell.”<br/>“Ten million dollars,” Charles said. “Should cover the damage.”<br/>Tracy stared. “Ten—TEN what?! Are you insane? Ten million?! Charles, what did you do?!”<br/>“I collected it.”<br/>“Collected it HOW?!”<br/>He shrugged. “I made them pay for the damages.”<br/>“Oh for God’s sake,” she groaned. “You have caused another mess, haven’t you? Which one of them did you break this time? A leg? A rib? A spine?! They are going to come back here looking for me. And when they do they’ll kill you. Why are you like this?!”<br/>Charles looked at her quietly.<br/>“You didn’t even ask if I was hurt,” he said.<br/>Tracy blinked. “What—”<br/>“You didn’t ask if I was injured after I tried to help you,” he repeated. “You just started shouting.”<br/>She rubbed her forehead. “Because you are being reckless! This is stupid, Charles. You have to return the money before they come back. The Titan family will destroy you. They don’t forgive.”<br/>“Well,” he said, “it’s your choice to return it or keep it.”<br/>He turned to leave.<br/>Tracy’s voice cracked. “You can’t just leave after causing me problems! Ugh… you have to stay. At least stay with me for a month. To protect me.”<br/>He paused and scoffed.<br/>“You have my number,” he said without turning. “Call me if anything happens.”<br/>As he walked out, Tracy finally muttered under her breath, “Thank you…”<br/>---<br/>At home, he pushed open the apartment door.<br/>Lizzypie was lying on the sofa, legs crossed, face glowing from the screen of her tablet as she watched a drama. She barely glanced up when he entered.<br/>“You know what’s funny in most romance shows?” she said. “The male lead always becomes stupid because of one lady… when there are plenty of women out there. Then the girl breaks his heart. Happens every time.”<br/>She paused, looked at Charles, and smirked.<br/>“You are not becoming stupid too… are you?”<br/>Charles scoffed and dropped onto the sofa. “What do you mean?”<br/>Lixxypie didn’t look away from her tablet. “I mean I can’t understand you,” she said. “Godfather gave you three requests. Three. And you wasted all of it on your ex bitch.”<br/>Charles chuckled.<br/>Lixxypie rolled her eyes. “I heard everything. You used the third request today. And for what? To help her again. You are unbelievable.”<br/>“She didn’t deserve what happened,” Charles said. “They destroyed her company. I Would have helped anyone in such a situation”.<br/>Lixxypie clicked her tongue. “So stupid.”<br/>He ignored the jab.<br/>She finally looked up, lowered the tablet, and sat straighter. “Anyway,” she said, “enough of your emotional nonsense. Let talk about the refinery you want to build”<br/>Charles wanted to build a refinery. If he successfully did that, he would become the first person to do it without government interference.<br/>They spent the next hour discussing plans. Land. Machinery. Processing units. Security. Government resistance. Competitors. Lizzypie pointed out loopholes, routes, costs and manpower. It was going to cost a lot he didn't even currently have.<br/>Around 10 pm, Charles’s phone chimed.<br/>One message. Unknown number.<br/>[It’s me.<br/>Mr. Eden, CEO of Titan.<br/>I would like to meet you now. Pentemoon Hotel. Room 904]<br/>Charles stiffened.<br/>Why a meeting at night?<br/>Before he could process it, a second message came in.<br/>[It’s about your father.<br/>I have something to tell you about him.<br/>Do not tell anyone you are coming]<br/>Charles’s jaw tightened.<br/>Lizzypie noticed the shift on his face instantly. “What is that?”<br/>He locked the phone. “Nothing serious.”<br/>She raised an eyebrow. “Then why does your face look like that?”<br/>“It’s nothing, Lizzypie,” he said. Then stood up and excused himself.<br/>“You said it's nothing. Yet you are going somewhere tonight?” Lizzypie raised concern.<br/> “I will tell you when I return.” </div>
