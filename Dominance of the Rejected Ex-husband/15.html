        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div>Charles arrived at the location within thirty minutes, his heart pounding harder with each passing second. He prayed silently that Tracy hadn’t gone through with her madness.<br/>The parking lot looked eerily calm. No smoke. No screaming crowd. No chaos. Only dim streetlights stretching shadows across rows of parked cars.<br/>He narrowed his eyes, dragging his suitcase behind him, when he spotted a lone figure walking toward him. It was Zoe.<br/>“Where is she?” Charles demanded, his voice clipped.<br/>Zoe exhaled heavily, a strange flicker in her eyes. “Since you are here, I will leave you two.”<br/>“What?” Charles frowned, bewildered. But before he could question further, Zoe turned her back and walked away without another word.<br/>Charles stood frozen for a beat, suspicion crawling up his spine. Something didn’t add up. Why would Zoe just leave if Tracy was in danger?<br/>Jaw clenched, he moved quickly toward the silver car Zoe had pointed out.<br/>Through the tinted glass, he caught sight of her. Tracy. Sitting calmly in the driver’s seat, perfectly composed.<br/>Not a drop of alcohol in sight.<br/>Charles rapped his knuckles against the glass, anger surging. “Hey! What the hell are you doing, Tracy?”<br/>Slowly, the door opened. Tracy stepped out with a calm smile,  almost triumphant.<br/>“Finally,” she said softly, her eyes glinting in the pale light. “You came for me.”<br/>Charles froze, his pulse hammering in his ears. She wasn’t drunk.<br/>It hit him in a wave of bitter realization.<br/>He had been played and deceived. Zoe had been acting. And Tracy had staged all of it, just to drag him here.<br/>Charles’ fists clenched at his sides. “Unbelievable,” he muttered under his breath. “I should have seen this. There’s no way a big-shot CEO would pull something so reckless. And yet… here I am.”<br/>Tracy tilted her head, her smile never faltering.<br/>Charles’ eyes darkened as he stepped closer, his voice cold and sharp. “So, what’s all this, Tracy? Another one of your childish games?”<br/>“You know faking an emergency is illegal, right?” he added.<br/>Tracy only smiled, tilting her head with an air of playful assurance. “My emergency is that I wanted to see you.”<br/>She watched him, fully expecting a look of gratitude or delight. Instead, he simply scoffed.  “Well, it looks like you are more than fine. I will be leaving now.” He turned to walk away.<br/>“Wait,” she called out quickly. Her tone shifted, almost trembling. “I’m truly drunk… won’t you help me out?”<br/>Before he could answer, she yanked out a half-empty bottle of liquor from the car and gulped it down recklessly.<br/>Charles lunged forward, snatching it from her. “What the hell are you doing, Tracy?!” His voice cracked with anger. “Where’s your driver? You are the CEO of a company… when will you stop acting so damn recklessly?”<br/>She leaned against the car door, smirking faintly. “You will be the one driving. You’re my husband.”<br/>Charles’ jaw tightened. “Not again. No, Tracy. We are divorcing in two days.”<br/>She stepped closer, her perfume wafting sharply into his nose. “That’s exactly what I’m saying. I’m still your wife till then.”<br/>“You are so shameless,” Charles snapped. He turned on his heel. “I’m done here.”<br/>Her voice lashed out behind him. “You know… I have men lining up for me. I can call any of them right now to come pick me up.”<br/>He stopped, fists curling.<br/>“Look,” she went on, pulling out her phone, scrolling quickly before shoving it toward him. “See these?”<br/>Text after text lit the screen, messages from Derek. Begging to come get her. Calling her pen names. Babe, sweetheart and so on.<br/>Charles’ stomach twisted. Was she trying to rub it in his face? Trying to make him jealous? Proving that he’d never be able to live without her? Because it wasn’t working.<br/>“I don’t care, Tracy,” he said flatly. “You can be with whoever the hell you want.”<br/>But then her expression shifted. Her smile fell. “Look… I know you are confused because of what you see in the video. But Francis was never mine.”<br/>Charles stared at her, waiting for what she would say.<br/>“I’m not his mother,” she said firmly, almost pleading. “That day, I said what I said only so Francis wouldn’t be left out with his classmates. He’s just a child, for God’s sake.”<br/>He let out a cold laugh. “Unbelievable. All your stories you share seem personal. And I don’t even care if you’re the mother or not.”<br/>“Don’t you get it?” she pressed, eyes glistening now. “I’m explaining things. I want to avoid this divorce… for you. How will you even live without me?”<br/>“None of your business,” Charles said, his tone sharp as glass. “And I don’t care what explanation you spin. Nothing you say will erase what I saw in that hotel room. You even ordered condoms.”<br/>Tracy’s voice cracked as she barked, “I told you, that was for a project! Why are you so gullible?”<br/>Charles scoffed, shaking his head. She was talking in circles, saying sorry without apologizing, using pride as a shield. <br/>Even if she fell to her knees and begged, it wouldn’t matter anymore. Tracy had shown him where he stood in her life, beneath her pride, beneath her lies.<br/>And yet, she wouldn’t let him go.<br/>“I will introduce you to Francis properly next time, so you can both make things up and live together,” she said suddenly.<br/>Charles scoffed. Tracy really wanted him to bind himself to the sin of his ex-lover.<br/>Her audacity…she didn’t even regard Charles. The scene dissolved into something raw and messy.<br/>“I have already made up my mind about the divorce,” Charles said, voice like ice. He turned and began walking away.<br/>But before he could take three steps, her hand shot out, gripping his tightly.<br/>“Charles. My patience is wearing thin here. I have been tolerating your…can't you see? You kept pushing and pushing. Don’t you see I value our marriage and didn’t want to let it break? Yet you don’t care! Look, if you leave tonight, it's over for us..finally over!”.</div>
