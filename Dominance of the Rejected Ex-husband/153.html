        <h1>Chapter 153</h1>
        <div>Charles, with sapphire and others in the car on their way back to the city.  He had already texted lizzypie who had been calling him that he was on his way. <br/>When they arrived at the hotel, Lizzie was standing near the entrance like she had been waiting all night. The moment Charles stepped out, she rushed forward and grabbed his collar.<br/>“What the fuck is that?” she snapped. “Why did you kneel for that kid? And beg for money too?” Her eyes burned. “That was Damien’s son, wasn’t it? I checked.”<br/>Charles nodded, a faint smirk touching his lips. “Yeah.”<br/>Her grip tightened. “What the fuck, Charles. How did it even get that far?”<br/>He leaned closer and said quietly, “Maybe it wouldn’t have if you stayed.”<br/>Lizzie froze. Then she laughed without humor. “So now you are saying you can’t take care of yourself without me?”<br/>Charles didn’t answer.<br/>The car door opened behind them.<br/>Sapphire stepped out first, smoothing her clothes, toolbox in hand. She inclined her head politely. “Good evening.”<br/>Lizzie’s eyes locked onto her and didn’t move.<br/>Then Tina and Amara burst out of the car.<br/>“Uncle Charles!” Tina spun in a circle, arms wide. “Is this where you live? Wow. It’s so beautiful.”<br/>Amara nodded eagerly. “It’s huge.”<br/>Lizzie looked between them, clearly thrown. “Who are they?”<br/>Charles said calmly. “Let talk inside”<br/>“No.” Lizzie blocked his path. “You explain now.”<br/>Charles exhaled, then gently took her hand. “Give me a minute.”<br/>He led her a few steps aside and spoke low, controlled, telling her everything. The girls incident, and the fight, and what Mr. Damien really was.<br/>Lizzie listened attentively. Her face shifted from anger to disbelief.<br/>When he finished, she stared at him for a long moment.<br/>“Okay. I get that you’re helping them. But are the three of them going to live in our apartment?” Lizzypie stated <br/>“No,” Charles said. “I will rent another apartment for them here in the hotel.”<br/>Lizziepie frowned. “That will cost a lot. Rent. Food and clothing!”<br/>“Take it from my money,” he replied without hesitation. “It’s only for a little while.”<br/>She studied his face, searching for doubt, then sighed. “You are unbelievable. You only know them for two days!”<br/>Charles just smiled as they walked back to the others.<br/>Lizzie forced a polite smile and extended her hand. “I’m Lizziepie. You can call me Lizzy”<br/>Sapphire accepted it with a small bow of her head. “Sapphire. Thank you for understanding.”<br/>Tina grinned. “Nice to meet you. I'm Tina”<br/>Amara nodded shyly. “Hello, I'm Amara.”<br/>Before anything else could be said, Charles’s phone rang.<br/>It was from Serena.<br/>He finally answered.<br/>“What the heck is wrong with you?” Serena shouted immediately. “Why are you only picking up now? Where the fuck are you?”<br/>“Relax,” Charles said. “I’m fine.”<br/>“Fine?” she snapped. “What was that video?  Are you kneeling for a boy? Begging him for money?”<br/>“I will explain later”<br/>“No, you need to explain now,” Serena said quickly. “You need to come to my place now. My father is furious.”<br/>“Why would he be?” Charles asked flatly.<br/>“Please,” she said, her voice dropping. “Just come. I am begging you. Before this gets worse for me.”<br/>Charles closed his eyes briefly. He didn’t see why he had to answer to Mr. Moretti always, but Serena sounded genuinely scared.<br/>“Alright,” he said. “I’m on my way.”<br/>“Thank you,” she breathed. “Please hurry.”<br/>The call ended.<br/>Charles turned to Lizzie. “Can you handle things here? Get them a room. I have go”<br/>She nodded without asking questions. “okay.”<br/>Sapphire reached for his hand. “Where are you going?”<br/>“To take care of something,” he said gently. “I will  be back soon. Stay with Lizzie. You can trust her.”<br/>Tina’s face fell. “Please don’t be long, Uncle Charles.”<br/>Amara hugged his arm. “We’re only comfortable around you.”<br/>He smiled faintly. “I’ll be back. I promise.”<br/>He stepped away, flagged down a taxi, and slid inside then drove away.<br/>Lizzie turned slowly toward Sapphire.<br/>Sapphire offered an awkward, forced smile.<br/>Up close, Lizzie could tell. Sapphire was old enough to be her sister, mature, composed. And beautiful. Not just pretty, but the kind of beauty that settled in the eyes. Her figure was graceful, natural. Lizzypie eyes went from her big breast, to thin waist, hot long legs, and killer hips. <br/>So this is it, she thought. This is why he risked his life.<br/>She clicked her tongue quietly. ‘That bastard. He always knew how to capture women’.<br/>Sapphire shifted, misreading the silence. “I’m sorry for disturbing you,” she said carefully. “Your husband has done so much for us. We really didn’t mean to cause any trouble.”<br/>Lizzie scoffed. “He’s not my husband.”<br/>Sapphire blinked. “Oh. Your boyfriend then? Or… fiancée?”<br/>Lizzie scoffed again, sharper this time. “No. Nothing like that. We are just friends. A mere friend, you can have him if you want”<br/>“Oh,” Sapphire said softly with another forced smile. <br/>Lizzie adjusted her coat and gestured toward the hotel entrance. “Come. Let me get you an exquisite room.”<br/>Sapphire hesitated for half a second, then followed, Tina and Amara excitedly trailing behind. <br/>Meanwhile, Charles arrived at the Moretti’s mansion, as he stepped out from the taxi and was about to head in. <br/>Someone called him from behind.<br/>“Wow, so this is the beggar. Begging a child for money, that absolute shame of an adult!”.<br/>Charles turned towards it to see Collins, and beside him was Tracy. Collins hands on her hips. It was so clear that they were already into each other and not hiding it. Charles scoffed. <br/>Some days ago, Tracy was begging him to come back, just for her to be following Collins, a wealthy man around. <br/>Charles decided to ignore them, but this time Tracy was the one to talk.<br/>“Oh. You are hiding your face, it must be so embarrassing. How would you even go to another city without having money. Just for you to beg a teen. You disappoint me Charles, and I regret I once married you!”.</div>
