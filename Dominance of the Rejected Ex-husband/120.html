        <h1>Chapter 120</h1>
        <div>Everywhere went silent.<br/>Natasha stared at Damien’s corpse, horrified, her hand covering her mouth. Serena stood frozen, her face pale, her eyes trembling.<br/>Charles crouched beside the body, pried Damien’s mouth open, and saw crushed bits of a dark pill stuck between his teeth.<br/>“He poisoned himself,” Charles muttered.<br/>Serena exhaled shakily. “Fuck…”<br/>She turned to Charles, voice unsteady.<br/>“What was he saying… about your father? Did he really know him?”<br/>Charles shrugged lightly, “I don’t know what he meant either.”<br/>Serena stared at him longer, as if trying to read through him, but in the end she said nothing. She stood up and wiped her eyes.<br/>“Both of you leave,” she finally said. “I’m calling my father.”<br/>Charles nodded and Natasha followed him out.<br/>They stepped into the car. Charles drove, his expression calm, almost unreadable.<br/>After a few minutes of silence, Charles asked quietly,<br/>“Why were you meeting him?”<br/>Natasha sighed, still troubled. “He’s my father’s friend. One of his closest. I came to ask questions… I thought maybe he knew something useful for the investigation.”<br/>Charles nodded. “Seems he knew something after all. He knew my father.”<br/>Natasha frowned. “Yes, he did, he said… ‘You’re with the wrong woman.’ Is he talking about Serena?”<br/>Charles shrugged again. “I don’t know.”<br/>Natasha leaned back, thinking deeply. “There’s more to this. I will continue digging. And Charles… be careful around Serena, just in case.”<br/>Charles just nodded, he dropped Natasha off, then drove home.<br/>---<br/>Lizzypie opened the door as he knocked, She rushed to him,  scanning him up and down.<br/>“How did things go? You are covered in blood, what happened?”<br/>Charles took a breath and told her single everything that happened today.<br/>Lizzypie listened silently, then sighed heavily.<br/>“Like I said… don’t overwhelm yourself,” she murmured. “Finish Godfather’s missions. Once you are done, you will know the truth about your father.”<br/>She stepped closer, her expression softening.<br/>“And when that day comes, you will have the power to get revenge. The real revenge.”<br/>Her voice lowered. “Until then, don’t expose yourself. Mr. Vincent hid you for a reason.”<br/>Charles nodded slowly.<br/>“Okay.”<br/>Lizzypie smiled faintly, then leaned up and pecked him on the cheek.<br/>“You are doing well, young master.”<br/>×××××<br/>The next morning, Lizzypie woke him up and said, “I have located where Derek is.”<br/>Charles sat up immediately. He had told her to find him. Derek couldn’t just run away after everything he had done and go scot-free.<br/>They prepared quickly, left the hotel, and drove straight to the location Lizzypie tracked.<br/>It was a sea depot, a quiet one near the cargo docks. Containers stacked everywhere, workers far in the distance. <br/>Derek was there.<br/>He stood near a small boat he had paid for. Almost thirty thugs surrounded him, some with guns, carrying bags for him. He wasn’t even with his son. He had left the boy elsewhere without concern.<br/>Derek was laughing, drinking cheap alcohol with roasted chicken in front of him.<br/>“Haha… I will be in China soon to enjoy my money. Tracy was so dumb. She even made my mission to dupe her easy,” he bragged loudly.<br/>“One hundred and fifty million. Hahaha. I will enjoy my life there.”<br/>He picked another piece of chicken, still laughing, when a calm voice chimed in.<br/>“You are really enjoying yourself.”<br/>Derek froze.<br/>His hand stopped mid-air.<br/>He recognized that voice immediately.<br/>His smile faded.<br/>He slowly raised his head…And saw Charles standing in front of him. Beside him was Lizzypie.<br/>The thugs immediately pointed their guns at Charles. Derek stood up slowly, his face twisting with anger and confusion.<br/>“How the fuck do you know I’m here?” he barked.<br/>Charles didn’t even blink as he walked closer, calm like he wasn’t surrounded by armed men at all.<br/>“You think you can just run away after everything you did?”<br/>Derek scoffed harshly. “What the fuck do you want from me? I didn’t take anything from you. So what are you doing here?”<br/>Charles stared at him.<br/>“You… betrayed Tracy and duped her. So return the 150 million gently… and I will let you go without reporting you to the police.”<br/>Derek laughed in disbelief.<br/>Laughed like Charles was insane.<br/>“Are you stupid? Or just dense?” Derek snapped. “Tracy betrayed you, divorced you because of me, and you are here talking about her like she’s some angel? What’s your own business if I dumped her?”<br/>“She worked for everything she achieved. You have no right to run away with it.” Charles Stated. <br/>Derek spat on the ground.<br/>“Maybe you shouldn’t have uploaded that video then! You ruined her life, not me.”<br/>He spread his arms wide and smirked.<br/>“Look around you. These are my men. They listen only to me. They will shoot you right here on the spot if I order them. So leave now… while I’m still being nice.”<br/>Charles said quietly, “You are the one that should listen to me… while I’m still nice. Just transfer the money back.”<br/>Derek stared at him for a moment, then burst into an irritated laugh.<br/>“Ahhhh, now I understand,” he said, pointing at Charles. “You are not here because of Tracy. You just want the money. Right?”<br/>He clicked his tongue.<br/>“You know what? Let’s not fight. I will give you thirty million dollars out of it. That’s a lot for someone like you.”<br/>Charles scoffed. “I want it all.”<br/>Derek’s face twisted instantly.<br/>“You are being arrogant right now! And I don’t give a fuck if I order my boys to kill you right here!” he yelled. “Your greed will kill you!”<br/>Charles didn’t respond. He didn’t flinch.<br/>He just stared at Derek with that calm, cold face that irritated him even more.<br/>Derek snarled.<br/>“Well… maybe you need to die.”<br/>He raised his hand—ready to give the kill order.<br/>But before his hand could even fully rise…<br/>A figure silently appeared behind Charles.<br/>It was Rain.<br/>Every thug froze instantly as guns trembled in their hands.</div>
