        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div><p>Derek laughed harshly, his voice cutting through the murmurs.“Haha! What a pathetic excuse. This is what poor men always say to console themselves , that their intentions matter more than wealth. In truth, he’s nothing but a social climber, looking for a way to secure a job under the Moretti family!”</p><p>The crowd chuckled, some nodding in agreement.</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s eyes narrowed dangerously. “If that’s why you came… if you wanted a job, you should have said it outright. Why cause such a disgraceful commotion?”</p><p>Charles exhaled slowly, his shoulders rising and falling. “Then just get me Captain Fred,” he said firmly.</p><p>A ripple of shock spread through the hall.</p><p>Mr. Moretti’s face darkened, his voice sharp as steel.</p><p> “Captain Fred? And why do you insist on him? Or…” his tone grew colder, “…are you a spy? What exactly is your plan here?”</p><p>The air thickened with suspicion.</p><p>“Yes! Yes, that must be it!” Derek shouted, seizing the moment like a jackal. </p><p>He pointed at Charles with wild triumph. “He’s no guest. He’s a spy! A liar, creeping in here with false claims!”</p><p>The crowd swelled with agreement, voices overlapping.</p><p>“Of course! He doesn’t belong here.”</p><p> “He’s a lowlife, look at him.”</p><p> “Either he’s here begging for job scraps or spying for someone.”</p><p> “He should be thrown out at once!”</p><p>The noise rose higher, a chorus of contempt battering Charles from all sides.</p><p>Meanwhile, from afar, the sound of heels clicking against marble rang out. It was Serena.</p><p>Her gown shimmered with a subtle glow under the chandeliers, the fabric hugging her figure with refined elegance before flowing down like liquid silk.</p><p>The deep-blue gown showed her striking figure, and the off-shoulder design revealed her smooth skin, glowing like porcelain under the light. Her beauty silenced the room. Everyone gulped.</p><p>But Serena’s eyes… were on Charles. She had already grasped what was unfolding. She could see the man who had saved her last night being humiliated. Her steps quickened, the room parting for her as though by instinct, until she arrived at the exact center of the commotion.</p><p>She stood frozen for a moment, blaming herself for this. After all, she was the one who told him to come, saying Captain Fred would be waiting for him. But she had unknowingly sent Fred on an errand, causing this chaos.</p><p>Her hero, the man who had risked his life to save her..was being mocked, insulted, dragged through the mud right in front of everyone. </p><p>There was no way she was going to let that happen. Even if she hadn’t fully decided to trust him yet.</p><p>Without a second thought, Serena strode straight up to Charles. Forgetting all about appearances, she grabbed his hand and said, breathless with excitement: “Oh my God… is it really you?”</p><p>The onlookers were stunned. It was truly Serena, the Moretti heiress and she was holding his hand.</p><p>Her touch was soft, delicate, like a puff of cotton.</p><p>Charles’s heart was racing. The most beautiful woman in the room was holding his hand.</p><p>Seeing Serena’s beauty up close, his breath caught. He had seen her last night in the chaos, but not this clearly. Now he could truly see her.</p><p>She was breathtaking.</p><p>And she was the first wealthy person in all these years who didn’t judge others by their appearance or repay kindness with betrayal. She was kind, approachable, and brilliant.</p><p>For a moment, he was completely smitten. Even without his grandfather’s test, he knew he would do anything,  absolutely anything..to marry Serena.</p><p>“Yes, it’s me, Ms. Serena. Happy birthday, long life and prosperity, with more to do on earth, in great wealth and health,” Charles said with a small smile.</p><p>Serena had received countless birthday wishes that day, but Charles’s words were the ones that meant the most. </p><p>They were simple, exactly as she always preferred, never overdone with flowery speeches or mountains of gifts. His wishes sounded sincere, and it carried a prayer.</p><p>As she looked at him with quiet tenderness, Charles shifted awkwardly, a faint blush creeping up his neck. No woman had ever looked at him like that, not even Tracy during their most intimate moments.</p><p>For a fleeting instant, Charles felt truly happy. Because this woman, who had fought like a goddess of war yesterday, now stood before him soft, gentle, and almost vulnerable.</p><p>But that moment of connection came at a cost. Every man at the party who secretly harbored feelings for Serena now stared at him with burning jealousy.</p><p>“What? He really knows her?”</p><p> “Look, they are holding hands. I’d do anything to get that chance.”</p><p>The very ones who had mocked him moments ago now whispered in bitter envy.</p><p>Derek stepped forward again, shoving Charles hard in the chest. “Serena, you really know this guy?”</p><p>Serena didn’t hesitate. “I do… though I don’t know his name.”</p><p>The crowd stirred, baffled. She didn’t even know his name, yet she was holding his hand?</p><p>This was Serena Moretti—graceful, poised, the very definition of refinement. And here she was, defending a man who stood out like a piece of garbage in a hall of elites.</p><p>Derek’s jaw tightened, his voice sharp with disbelief. “You know him… but you don’t even know his name? Then how do you know each other?”</p><p>Serena ignored him completely, her patience with Derek vanishing. She turned to her father, her voice steady and clear. “Dad, he’s the one who saved my life. The man I told you about.”</p><p>Mr. Moretti was surprised. Serena had explained earlier how this stranger had dealt with armed gangsters so swiftly and bravely. He had been eager to meet him, but now, seeing his poor appearance, his eagerness faltered.</p><p>Still, how could a man like this just appear out of nowhere and save his daughter? He felt a deep urge to demand an investigation, to uncover the truth.</p><p> Yet he also knew it would look dishonorable to publicly discriminate against the man his daughter defended. The Moretti family prided themselves on virtue and moral standing; he could not afford to tarnish that reputation now.</p><p>So, after a measured pause, he walked toward Charles.</p><p> “Thank you for saving my daughter. You are our honored guest today. We will treat you with the respect you deserve. Please, come inside.”</p><p>Charles bowed his head slightly. “Oh, thank you…  I’m not here because I saved her. I only came to congratulate her. Anyone in my position would have done the same..it wasn’t such a big deal,” he replied in a polite, almost humble way.</p><p>This unexpected humility made Derek furious. He hadn’t expected the situation to twist in Charles’s favor.</p></div>
