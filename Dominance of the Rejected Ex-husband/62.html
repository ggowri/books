        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div><p>Natasha was still in a daze as she brought the stone out for everyone to see, and they were all shocked as well.</p><p>“What the heck… that’s a yellow sapphire!”</p><p>“That’s even more expensive than a blue ruby. How the hell did he get it right?!”</p><p>“Am I dreaming? This is really a sapphire!”</p><p>Derek and Norman stood frozen, too shocked even to speak. Derek had to step closer to examine it properly and sure enough, it was a yellow sapphire.</p><p>“How… how is this possible…?” Derek stammered, utterly confused. Most rough stones were empty or low grade; finding a sapphire or a ruby was almost unheard of. Yet Charles had been so confident he had bet his fingers. How could he be that sure?</p><p>Norman rose, gulping. He sniffed and stared at the gem; its glow and brilliance were undeniable. He couldn’t deny it. “How did you get it? This is impossible! What is happening here?!” he yelled.</p><p>Charles remained calm. “You lost the bet. I don’t have anything to explain to you.”</p><p>Norman slammed the table. “No! Absolutely not! Natasha, you and him planned this—you already knew what was inside and used it to scam us!”</p><p>Natasha shook her head. “I brought the stone out for everyone to see. You can see it’s rough, flawless, with no signs of cutting. How could I possibly know what’s inside? And this stone is rare, how would I even get it right?”</p><p>“Who knows?” Derek barked. “Maybe you cut a lot of stones one by one, until you found the sapphire. That’s why Charles was so sure, maybe you rigged it!”</p><p>Natasha glared at him, disgust twisting her face. “Are you making any sense to yourself?”</p><p>The time it would take to cut all the stones—it would be impossible to do it in just the few minutes they spent in the store section. </p><p>Practically, Stone store owners didn’t bother checking the stones themselves. They bought most of them in expensive wholesale, and buyers expected reputable, flawless stones with no signs of prior cuts.</p><p> If a store owner cut every stone looking for hidden gems and most of it came up empty, they could lose a fortune since stones that contain rubies or sapphires are extremely rare. </p><p>Many people had tried it before and ended up ruined. It was safer to sell the stones as-is for a couple million and let buyers gamble on what was inside</p><p>Charles repeated, steady, “Well then—I won. I will take my reward.” He turned to Natasha.</p><p>Natasha slid Derek’s envelope across the table; the flap rustled, bills shifting inside. Derek lunged for it, panic stretching his face. “No—give me my money back! That’s all I have! Please!” His voice broke.</p><p>“You made the bet,” Charles said flatly. “You lost and must pay the price. So shut up.”</p><p>Derek’s hands trembled. “Please—”</p><p>Natasha didn’t listen to him and gave it to Charles.</p><p> Without hesitation. She brought out a portable card terminal, took Norman’s card, and was about to swipe it. Norman’s face drained.</p><p>“Natasha, you can’t do that—” he began. “Return the card. Don’t do anything stupid.”</p><p>“You told me to withdraw twenty million if you lost,” she said, eyes hard. “You said it in front of everyone.”</p><p>Norman scrambled for an excuse. “I—I was bluffing. Come on, just give me the card back.”</p><p>Charles smiled, faint and dangerous. “Were you bluffing when you said you would cut off my fingers? You sounded sincere.”</p><p>Norman pressed his palms to the table, desperate. “Please, Natasha—don’t take it. If you return my money, I will forget everything you did today. I will make business smooth with you again. Please, just give it back, don’t remove anything.”</p><p>Natasha paused, this was a chance for her to redeem herself. Charles watched her, waiting what her decision would be. “No. This is a bet. You made the promise. I’m withdrawing twenty million.”</p><p>She swiped the card.</p><p>The terminal beeped, Tooon!, and the amount wiped away from Norman’s account instantly.</p><p>“No—!” Norman shouted. The twenty million had been money his father gave him to hand to a business partner. Though he was heir to the Consortium, Norman’s father had stopped giving him large sums of money.</p><p>Norman squandered money, lived lavishly, and had been warned once more that a mistake would cost him his inheritance. If he failed to deliver this transfer, his father would be furious and possibly remove him as heir.</p><p>“Natasha, please return my money now! I swear, if you fail to— I will make you regret this. I will smash your shop. I will ruin you,” Norman spat.</p><p>Natasha didn’t flinch. “Stop being pathetic. Embrace your loss.” Something in Charles’s calm had seeped into her, and gave her a lot of confidence.</p><p>Norman grew angrier.</p><p>He turned to his two big guards. “Get my money back. Now. Beat them. Crush them. Bring my money back.”</p><p>The two men stood like statues. They didn’t answer because they couldn’t move—Charles had already put them out of commission a little while before. One still clutched his groin, the other was holding his leg. </p><p>“Are you two useless?” Norman barked. “I said go and collect my money back or I will sack you both!” But they still don&#x27;t move.</p><p>This made him lunged at Natasha himself. Charles caught his wrist in a hurry and twisted it backwards.</p><p>“My hand, my hand!”</p><p>Norman howled, trying to let go but Charles was so strong, then suddenly he let him go and this made him fall hard</p><p>Natasha then threw the card at him. It hit his chest.</p><p>He held his wrist in pain and started swearing. “You dare touch me? I swear I will have my revenge. You will regret crossing me.”</p><p>He picked up his card.</p><p>  “Will you leave, or should I call the guard to throw you out?” Natasha told him</p><p>Norman frothed, sputtering curses as everyone began filming with their phones. “Do you know who I am? You will pay for this! I swear!”</p><p>Derek looked around, and could see everyone&#x27;s eyes on them. It was so humiliating and embarrassing, and he leaned toward Norman “We should just leave for now. We will get back at them later.”</p><p>Even though Derek and Norman weren&#x27;t friends before, the humiliating moments have made them one.</p><p>Norman pointed a shaking finger towards Charles and Natasha. “I will get back at you two, you will both go on your knees and apologize for what you both did!”</p><p>He barked as Derek dragged him out.</p></div>
