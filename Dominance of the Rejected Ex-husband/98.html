        <h1>Chapter 98</h1>
        <div><p>Charles and Lizzypie arrived home quietly. It always happened whenever Lizzypie brought up Tracy’s matter.</p><p>She couldn’t understand why Charles was hesitating on this mission.</p><p>It was obvious Tracy was a bitch. Arrogant, manipulative—someone.  Charles should have destroyed her without a second thought. Yet he was holding back, and Lizzypie hated it.</p><p>When they arrived, the truck with the stones was already parked outside.</p><p>With one glance, Charles spotted a sapphire stone.</p><p>His eyes lit up. Excitement rushed through him. That was it—the stone he needed. With it, he could drain its energy, upgrade his Soul Sight, and finally defeat Sir Jim.</p><p>“So,” Lizzypie said, crossing her arms. “Now that you have found your precious sapphire, what are we doing with the rest?”</p><p>Charles rubbed his chin. “I’m thinking of giving them to Natasha. She deals in stone trading. I’ll take a profit percentage from her sales.”</p><p>Lizzypie narrowed her eyes. “Mmm. What a pussy can do. The power of sweet sex—I bet Natasha handles you well.”</p><p>Charles frowned. “Hey, I’m not doing this because of sex. It’s business. Strictly profit.”</p><p>“Sure,” Lizzypie smirked. “I will believe that the day pigs fly. Anyway, go for your training.”</p><p>Charles leaned in and pecked her cheek. “Thanks, my first wife. For always being with me.”</p><p>Lizzypie nudged him off. “Hmm, don’t start that. We are not having sex.”</p><p>Charles chuckled. “That’s not what I meant. I really mean it. Just wait till I become the Godfather—you will be the Goddess Mother.”</p><p>She laughed. “You and your sweet talk. Go already.”</p><p>He smiled, waved, and left for his training.</p><p>Lizzypie stood by the door for a while, watching him go. Then she sighed. “He’s improving a lot more than I thought. He just needs to keep his emotions in check and forget that petty girl.”</p><p>Her smile faded. A moment of silence stretched, then she muttered under her breath, “God, I feel like fucking him if not for this damn situation I’m in.”</p><p>Just then, her phone beeped.</p><p>She glanced at the screen and scoffed. “Speaking of the devil…”</p><p></p><p>××××</p><p>Charles didn’t stop absorbing the energy inside the sapphire stone after he cut it open.</p><p>He kept at it for two days. The first day, he couldn’t upgrade anything — the Soul Sight demanded a massive amount of energy.</p><p>But on the second day, it finally worked.</p><p>[Soul Sight upgraded successfully. 60%]</p><p>Charles sighed. He had expected more, but 60% was a stable category — strong enough if used wisely.</p><p>With this, he was confident he could defeat Sir Jim.</p><p>That same day, he decided to visit Natasha.</p><p>Before he left, Lizzypie warned him.</p><p>“Even though you’re at an average level now, don’t overuse it. Turn it on and off when needed. Be careful,” she said.</p><p>“Okay, first wife,” he teased, then walked out.</p><p>A few minutes later, he arrived at Natasha’s shop.</p><p>The store was empty. Natasha sat behind the counter, looking lifeless, a file spread open in front of her. She was so lost in thought she didn’t notice Charles come in.</p><p>“Hey there… hello… Natasha,” Charles called softly.</p><p>She jolted up, blinking. “Oh—Charles… Why are you here? Are you okay? Why did you leave the hospital already? Are you feeling fine?” Her tone carried genuine worry.</p><p>Charles smiled faintly. “Yeah, I’m fine. But I think I should be the one asking you that. You look… drained.”</p><p>Natasha sighed. “Look, you have to leave. Right now. Sir Jim and Steven will be here any minute.”</p><p>Her voice trembled. Fear was written all over her face.</p><p>Charles scoffed lightly, then eyed the file in front of her. “What is this? Don’t tell me you’re giving them your store.”</p><p>“It’s not like I have a choice,” she said, her voice breaking. “They said they would kill you if I refused—and destroy everything I own. I had to do this.”</p><p>She sniffled, forcing back tears.</p><p>Charles leaned forward and pulled her into a brief hug. “Everything’s gonna be okay. They won’t take the store from you. You will even get back the money Steven scam you of.”</p><p>Natasha looked up, shaking her head. “How? Charles, if you are thinking of fighting them again, please don’t. You can’t beat Sir Jim. I don’t want you getting hurt again.”</p><p>Charles scoffed again, about to respond—when the door burst open.</p><p>Two men walked in.</p><p>The devils themselves: Sir Jim and Steven.</p><p>Steven swaggered ahead, grinning. “Well, look who we have here. Seems like you are still alive, huh? What are you doing in my store?” He said it like he already owned the place.</p><p>Natasha quickly stepped in. “Steven, please. Don’t start any trouble. I will sign the document now and hand it over. The store will be yours. Just leave Charles out of it.”</p><p>Steven smirked. “Finally, some sense. Go ahead—sign it.”</p><p>Natasha picked up the pen with trembling fingers.</p><p>Just as Natasha raised the pen Charles stepped forward and grabbed her hand.</p><p>“Stop,” he said. His voice was low and steady.</p><p>Natasha froze. The pen hovered over the paper.</p><p>Steven lost it with this, he was so eager waiting for her sister to sign it just for Charles to disrupt it.</p><p> “What the fuck are you doing? Let her sign it now. Did Sir Jim not beat you to a pulp two days ago? Do you want another beating” He spat the words like a challenge.</p><p>Charles didn’t flinch. “I won’t let you force her into something she doesn’t want. She’s not signing.”</p><p>Steven laughed cold. “Your stubbornness will only make things worse. Hey sister. Tell your dog here to shut up. Leash him. Or I’ll ask Sir Jim to kill him right now.”</p><p>Sir Jim stood behind Steven. He said nothing. Only waiting for order.</p><p>Natasha’s hand trembled in Charles’s. She looked at him with tearful eyes. “I know you care about me.  That’s why you are doing this. But please. Stop. For your own safety. Let me sign it ”</p><p>Charles squeezed her hand and reassured her, “Chill. Nothing will happen to me this time.”</p></div>
