        <h1>Chapter 122</h1>
        <div>Tracy’s room was a disaster.<br/>Clothes on the floor, bottles everywhere, her hair tangled, eyes swollen from nonstop crying. She sat on the edge of her bed, drinking straight from a wine bottle like water.<br/>Two days ago she was one of the top ten richest women in the city.<br/>Now she was basically poverty-level, her company gone, reputation destroyed, everything ruined.<br/>On the table in front of her was a small vial of poison, half-opened. She stared at it blankly.<br/>The door suddenly swung open.<br/>Mrs. Hailey rushed in.<br/>The moment she saw the vial, she screamed and slapped it off the table so hard it rolled under the bed.<br/>“What…what the hell are you doing!?” she panicked.<br/>Tracy lifted her head slowly, eyes full of hate, heartbreak and alcohol.<br/>“What am I doing…?” she laughed bitterly. “MOM, you ruined my life. That’s what I’m doing.”<br/>Mrs. Hailey froze, unable to speak.<br/>Tracy stood up, wobbling. “Inside this room… under my own nose… you were fucking Derek. F–fucking. Derek. And you KNOW how people see us. They think he’s my boyfriend, and you… you went and fucked him behind my back.”<br/>Mrs. Hailey’s face collapsed with shame. “Tracy… please… I…”<br/>“You even let him dupe me,” Tracy shouted. “So where is he ? Where is your little boy toy?!”<br/>Mrs. Hailey cried, shaking. “I don’t know… I’ve been calling him, looking everywhere… he disappeared—”<br/>Tracy cut her off. “Get out. Get out of my room. Unless you find that bastard and collect my money, don't come back here. You bitch.”<br/>She called her own mother a bitch.<br/>Mrs. Hailey gasped, tears falling. “Tracy… please…”<br/>But Tracy wasn’t listening, she was too broken and too hurt.<br/>She lifted the bottle and was about to end it all. Just then her phone buzzed loudly.<br/>Ding.<br/>Teacy stopped; she recognized the alert tone. It wasn’t a normal notification. It was the one Tracy set only for large bank transfers.<br/>Tracy frowned. “What’s that?”<br/>She grabbed her phone and swiped.<br/>Ding.<br/>$30,000,000 alert.<br/>She blinked. “Uh… what…?”<br/>Ding.<br/>Another $30,000,000.<br/>Tracy’s eyes widened. “What… what the—”<br/>Ding.<br/>$20,000,000.<br/>Then more.<br/>Ding.<br/>Ding.<br/>Ding.<br/>Ding.<br/>Dozens of alerts pouring in, each one millions of dollars.<br/>For almost three full minutes, her phone didn’t stop vibrating.<br/>Tracy’s hands shook.<br/>Her face twisted in confusion, fear, shock.<br/>She finally opened her banking app.<br/>Her account balance had increased by…<br/>$150,000,000.<br/>The exact amount Derek stole from her.<br/>She whispered with trembling lips, “Is… is this a scam…?”<br/>Tracy’s hands shook.<br/>She stared at her screen, blinking fast.<br/>“A–am I seeing things…? Is this from another scammer…?” she whispered.<br/>Her mother rushed closer and snatched the phone gently to look.<br/>Her eyes widened.<br/>“No… Tracy, this is your bank app. This isn’t a scam. The money is… really in your account.”<br/>Before either of them could process it<br/>Ring! Ring!<br/>Tracy’s phone vibrated again.<br/>This time the caller ID said:<br/>METROPOLITAN POLICE – 911<br/>Her heart jumped.<br/>She slowly pressed the answer button.<br/>“H…hello?”<br/>A woman’s firm voice spoke on the other side.<br/>“Good afternoon. This is Sergeant Julie from the Metropolitan Station. You filed a stakeout and fraud report against Mr. Derek Roland.”<br/>Tracy’s lips pressed together tightly.<br/>“That bastard finally got caught…?” she asked under her breath.<br/>The sergeant continued, “We want to inform you Mr. Derek is currently in our custody. We found him in front of the station.”<br/>Tracy froze.<br/>“In front… of the station?”<br/>“Yes,” the officer said. “He was badly beaten. Very badly. Almost unrecognizable. Someone dropped him here and left.”<br/>Tracy blinked in shock.<br/>“We asked him about the stolen 150 million. He claimed he sent it back. Did you receive anything?”<br/>Tracy nodded her head repeatedly even though the officer couldn’t see her.<br/>“Y–yes. Yes, I received it. Just now. I really saw it.”<br/>“Good,” the sergeant replied. “We need you to come and give an official statement so we can finalize the case.”<br/>“O… okay,” Tracy said. “But you’re saying someone beat him and just… dropped him there?”<br/>“Most likely,” the officer said calmly. “We don’t know who. But it saved us the work.”<br/>Tracy whispered, “Okay… I will be there soon.”<br/>They hung up.<br/>Tracy just sat there, stunned, staring at her phone.<br/>“Derek was arrested…” she murmured.<br/>She looked up at her mother, shocked.<br/>“Wow.”<br/>“That’s… great news,” Mrs. Hailey said softly, feeling ashamed also.<br/>Tracy nodded, still confused.<br/>“But… someone beat him up and left him at the station,” she added. “Who would even do that…?”<br/>Before she could think further, her phone rang again.<br/>This time from Maya, her secretary. <br/>Tracy swallowed and slowly answered.<br/>Tracy lifted the phone to her ear, still dizzy from what just happened.<br/>“H…hello?”<br/>Maya’s voice came through, breathless and shaky.<br/>“Ma’am, someone just sent 100 million dollars to the company account.”<br/>Tracy’s heart skipped.<br/>“What…?” she whispered. “Maya, what are you talking about?”<br/>“I was shocked too,” Maya said quickly. “One hundred million dollars. It came with an email saying the sender wants to invest in the company.”<br/>Tracy sat up straight.<br/>Her eyes widened.<br/>“But… our company was already declared bankrupt… who would invest now?”<br/>“I confirmed the transaction,” Maya continued. “The money is real. Cleared. Sitting in our company account right now.”<br/>Tracy covered her mouth, stunned.<br/>“This person refuses to meet up, ma’am,” Maya added. “He just wrote that he believes in our company and wants to invest.”<br/>Tracy’s thoughts ran wild. One hundred million…Plus the 150 million she just got back…She could restart everything.<br/>“Who the hell is this mysterious man?” she whispered.</div>
