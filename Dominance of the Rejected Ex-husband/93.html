        <h1>Chapter 93</h1>
        <div><p>Natasha was scared of her brother&#x27;s sudden transformation; he wasn&#x27;t like this before.</p><p>She gulped and said, “I can&#x27;t give you the store. You are a gambler, a chronic one. You will destroy everything. I will raise the money I owe you to 40 million dollars. That is 70 percent of what this store makes per month; that should be enough.”</p><p>But Steven wasn&#x27;t having it. He scoffed, “What the heck are you saying? I want everything. I don&#x27;t want to share.”</p><p>Then Charles tapped his shoulder again. “Fella, you heard her right. If you don&#x27;t want me to break your bones right now, leave this company.”</p><p>Steven stared at him. “I have heard a lot about you, how tough you are. And I have already prepared!” Then he snapped his fingers.</p><p>Just then, a man entered, wearing a long black jacket and deep dark glasses. His hair was grey, and looking at him, Charles could tell he was probably in his early 50s.</p><p>Natasha frowned and muttered, “Sir Jim.”</p><p>Charles asked her, “You know him?”</p><p>She nodded and replied softly, “That&#x27;s our parents&#x27; personal bodyguard. He is very dangerous and knows how to fight a lot.” Then she faced him. “Sir Jim, what are you doing here?”</p><p>Jim just stared at Charles for a long moment and sighed. “It&#x27;s you… you are alive. You just have his face.”</p><p>Charles frowned in confusion, wondering what he was spewing. But he shrugged it off. He was just yapping nonsense to distract him.</p><p>Charles fearlessly stepped further in. Answering her question: “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Then Steven chimed in, “What does it look like? He now works for me, and we are here together to collect the store.”</p><p>Jim said, “Ma&#x27;am, please… hand the store over to him, and nothing will happen.”</p><p>Natasha couldn&#x27;t believe they were both ganging up against her. She was frightened, seeing this. Charles&#x27;s gaze locked on them.</p><p>“You know, it&#x27;s high time you both leave here right now, or…”</p><p>Steven chimed in, “Or what? You think you can defeat Sir Jim? Haha, it&#x27;s over for you if you dare.”</p><p>Charles faced the man, “Is that true? Well, leave this place, or you stay and challenge me, and we will fight.”</p><p>The man smirked, then took off his glasses. He had a wrinkled, hard face.</p><p>“Well, I will challenge you.”</p><p>Natasha gasped and jumped in between them. “Please, Charles, don&#x27;t do this. He is a dangerous man, and you can&#x27;t fight him.</p><p>Charles scoffed, believing Natasha underestimated him. He slightly pushed her aside. “Let me take care of this.</p><p>Natasha made way and still whimpered, “Please… stop.”</p><p>Charles wasn&#x27;t having it and told Sir Jim, “Bring it on.”</p><p>Sir Jim just stood there. Charles was annoyed and decided to go first.</p><p>[EYES OF SATAN ACTIVATED].</p><p>He used his eyes to slow time for himself and threw a powerful jab at him, just like he always does.</p><p>The jab was supposed to be so fast that Sir Jim wouldn&#x27;t even see it coming. But, shockingly, Jim just stepped aside a little and weaved the jab like it was nothin</p><p>Charles nearly tripped but still gallantly glanced back at Sir Jim. He was astonished! No one had ever weaved that flash punch. But this old man had just tilted his head, calm as still water.</p><p>Charles hissed and charged again, feet scraping the floor. </p><p>A left hook. A straight jab. A spinning back fist. His hands were blurs, cutting through the air like blades.</p><p>But Sir Jim swayed, bent and ducked everything.</p><p>Every hit Charles threw, he slipped past like smoke. His eyes didn’t even blink.</p><p>Charles growled, “What the heck!”He activated his X-ray also, and threw a long jab!</p><p>Jim turned at the perfect second, caught Charles’s wrist mid-strike like it was nothing, and twisted it.</p><p>“Ughhh”, Charles grunted, dropped to a knee, and swung his other fist, but Jim let go, leaned sideways, and slammed a heavy elbow straight into Charles’s jaw.</p><p>The room shook.</p><p>Charles stumbled back as he splat out blood. </p><p>Natasha screamed, “Charles!”</p><p>Steven burst out laughing. “I told you! You think you can fight Sir Jim?</p><p>Charles stood up and  wiped his mouth. He frowned.  “Who the hell are you?”</p><p>Jim said nothing. He just stepped forward slowly, deliberately and before Charles could even blink, a solid punch landed deep in his torso.</p><p>“Ugh—!” Charles wheezed. Air fled his lungs. He staggered, but Jim didn’t stop. He followed with a sharp knee to the groin.</p><p>Charles gasped, his knees folding, his body trembling from pain.</p><p>Jim grabbed his collar, lifted him slightly, and punched him again—this time straight to the gut.</p><p>Charles coughed violently, blood spilling from his mouth.</p><p>Natasha cried out, running forward, “Stop! Please, stop!”</p><p>But Steven stepped in front of her, grinning wide, eyes gleaming with twisted joy. “No, no, let him finish</p><p>Charles wiped the blood from his lips, eyes blazing. Charles knew  his X-ray, and the flash movements were all useless. The man moved faster than he could imagine.</p><p>He clenched his fist, fury boiling inside him. “No… no way. I’m not losing to this man”</p><p>Jim tilted his head, voice low but steady. “ Just give up. You can’t fight me.”</p><p>Natasha’s voice cracked. “Charles, please! He’ll kill you!</p><p>But Charles wasn’t listening, he wanted to win. Then he thought about the soul sight. Being able to predict what he would do next would give him a big advantage in defeating him.</p><p>But, he remembered Lizzypie’s warning not to use the power yet, it&#x27;s not stable, and could make him collapse.</p><p>Steven laughed at him, “so this is all you that you were bluffing. Please sir Jim, I want you to break his legs”.</p><p>Jim bowed and said, “At your command”, Ready to do what Steven told him.</p><p>Natasha begged them to stop, but they wouldn&#x27;t.  Steven wanted him crippled.</p><p>Charles shut his eyes slowly, drawing one deep, deliberate breath. They had left him with no choice. </p><p>[SOUL SIGHT ACTIVATED]</p></div>
