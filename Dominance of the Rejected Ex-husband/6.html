        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div>It was like he had been punched in the gut, like his heart was trying to claw its way out through his mouth. Why would Tracy keep doing this to him and, at the same time, still want to keep him around?<br/>With all these photos he was seeing, Tracy was long gone. She was truly, deeply in love with Derek and whatever they were giving her.<br/>He wanted to call her, blast her for what he had just seen, and demand an explanation. But right there, he knew it was all pointless. She wouldn't give him a straight answer, and moreover, he was divorcing her, why waste time on something already gone?<br/>He didn’t even know if he would make it back alive, so he didn’t want to spoil his last emotions. He decided to close the laptop.<br/>Just as he was about to do it, another WhatsApp message from Derek popped up.<br/>He squinted at the screen and should have ignored it. But it was a video. A video had been sent. His heart gripped his shirt. What video was this? He thought, what if it’s a sex video?<br/>“What are you doing in that house, Tracy?” he murmured, summoning his last courage to watch it.<br/>She had always lied about some Buddhist stuff; maybe this was the moment to catch her red-handed.<br/>As he opened it and watched, what he saw was far more destructive than sex. He wanted to die.<br/>The video was from school, showing a teacher with Francis in front of the class. The teacher had called Francis’s parents forward…and it was Derek and Tracy who came out. Tracy, his wife.<br/>At that moment, he had the worst doubt of his life. What if Tracy was really Francis’s parent?<br/>The video went on, with the teacher asking them to share their emotional moments. Tracy was eager to begin.<br/>“Where can I even begin? I have been finding every way to share this with everyone. Derek, the journey of my life, my husband, the love of my life, the sugar in my tea, my shoulder supporter, my everything. how we met, It wasn’t just love at first sight; it was developmental. We have been together since our childhood, our history goes far back. We went to school together: elementary, high school, and college. When we graduated, my lovely husband finally proposed to me, and I said yes!”<br/>She said it delightfully.<br/>Everyone purred at the love story.<br/>Charles shook his head to wipe away what he was seeing. What was all this? Derek was her first love. <br/>But Charles had met her seven years ago, and she swore he was her first love. In fact, she had proposed to him. Then she loved him, and they married. That’s when she changed. If she already had her first love back then, why marry him?<br/>Tears fell from his eyes. He didn’t even matter to her at all. She had her first love, yet married him. It was obvious. Tracy had just used him as a placeholder because she saw him as a poor man and exploited that.<br/>After their marriage, that was when Tracy changed, came out with the Buddhist stuff, and things started getting cold. So it had been because of her first love?<br/>The video continued: “There are so many unforgettable moments between us, and the ones I can remember are when he sold his scooter, which he had used, bought flowers with the money, and used it to build a path right from my house steps. And he used it to make a big heart. I stood in the middle of it with him. That was the day we made our first love, and had our little baby.”<br/>Tracy continued, her voice soft but filled with passion, “Our child was made out of the most passionate love-making”. <br/>Charles’s chest tightened. His hands shook. Sweet? Passionate?. The fact that Tracy felt almost shameless saying those things. <br/>“Oh no,” he whispered under his breath. “I got played.” With this video, Tracy confessed that Francis was her child. <br/>His stomach churned violently. Their marriage had lasted five years. Francis looked about five. That meant…  she had given birth after they were married. Everything clicked, that's the reason she was so adamant with adopting him.<br/>yet nothing made sense. He had never seen her pregnant.  <br/>The story Tracy shared next made him crumble further. Her voice rose with emotion as she recounted another memory.<br/>“He once rushed into a burning fire to save me. The fire was so strong, yet he covered me with his body, protecting me, not letting a single flame touch me. He even got minor burns, but he stayed with me, wrapped around me, making sure I was safe.”<br/>Charles felt his lungs tighten. His body ached with a combination of  grief, and rage. That was him! <br/>“I went through that fire for her… and she’s telling the world it was someone else!”.<br/>“And after that,” Tracy continued, “he stayed at the hospital for a week without sleeping, just to make sure I got better. He fell sick himself… but he didn’t care. He only cared about me.”<br/>Gasps and murmurs of awe came from everyone around.<br/> “Wow! I am so jealous!”.<br/>“I want this love!”.<br/>“What a perfect couple”.<br/>Charles’s knees felt weak. Tears streamed down his face. Every detail she shared, every memory, every act of devotion, it had all been him. All of it, he did it to get her love and she replaced him with Derek in the story.<br/>Tracy finished with a gentle smile: “I will always cherish our marriage and our child… nothing will change that. No poor useless man Will change it”<br/>Everyone clapped, some even cheered. But Charles couldn’t move. His heart shattered in silence. The poor useless man was him!. <br/>Charles had never blamed himself for being poor, but today, he did. “Why did I come to life like this? I want to be rich also, maybe if I'm rich, nothing like this would happen!”. </div>
