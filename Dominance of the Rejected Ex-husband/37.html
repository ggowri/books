        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div>Serena could not just listen and watch Charles take the blame, so she decided to speak up and interfere.<br/>But this time Charles held her down and said, "I will handle it."<br/>Serena stared at him. He had been acting tough yesterday, but she knew he was not rich enough to pull anything that would surprise the crowd. Even the ring had been traced; she knew Charles had borrowed the money from a dangerous loan shark.<br/>Derek would not stop. "What? Are you ashamed to tell us who you are? Tell us what you do and who your parents are."<br/>Charles replied calmly, "I am a firefighter and I am an orphan."<br/>"What? Serena's fiancé is a nobody!"<br/>"That is disappointing. Serena, avoid all the big men in the city; do not marry someone like him!"<br/>"A stupid lowlife."<br/>Derek smiled, savoring the moment. Tracy felt sad and thought, You should have stayed with me. None of this would have happened.<br/>Derek made the matter worse. "Also, he is Ms. Tracy's ex-husband. He left her because of a simple misunderstanding, just to be with Ms. Serena after he staged that rescue!"<br/>One guest said, "So you mean Ms. Serena was with him out of pity and gratitude because he saved her?"<br/>"Yes, when in fact that rescue was all part of his plan. He is sly and cunning and always clings to rich people. Even his ex wife can testify to that," Derek said, facing Tracy.<br/>Everyone turned to Tracy. She was startled. She had not expected this. They were literally asking her to testify that Charles was a horrible person.<br/>Tracy's mouth mumbled. Charles might be stubborn, but he had treated her well during their marriage. Even when she was cold to him, he always proved to be tolerant.<br/>But now she was being told to blame him in front of everyone.<br/>Derek pushed further. "What are you waiting for? Tell people who he really is."<br/>Then Tracy smirked. This was a perfect moment for her. If she shamed him, maybe Serena would feel disgusted and finally leave him. Maybe the two would break up.<br/>She stepped forward. "Yeah. He is horrible. So horrible. He always treated me badly in our marriage, even though I was the breadwinner. He did not treat me well at all. He would withhold affection and leave for days without calling. We had a misunderstanding and he asked for a divorce. I think he did it just to be with Ms. Serena!"<br/>“What!”<br/>“Wow. He is a horrible person.”<br/>“How did Ms. Serena fall for a guy like him?”<br/>Charles could not help but scoff. Tracy had just lied; she was the one who did all that.<br/>Mr. Vasilios was angry. "He is so poor and he has bad behavior. Serena, you really disappoint me, you and your father. Now leave this place this instant."<br/>Derek said, "Um, I think Ms. Serena is also a victim. The person who should leave here is this poor lowlife man."<br/>"Yeah. He should be the one."<br/>"Yeah, he should fucking leave."<br/>Charles was furious. Tracy had betrayed him again.<br/>He then faced Janet and Mike. "Everything they said about me is a lie, except that I am poor. The rest is a blatant lie. But I will leave. Before that, I would like to present a gift to you."<br/>Derek chimed in. "Haha, look at this foolish lowlife man. What is he about to do? What gift can he give us here? Do you think you can manipulate us like yesterday when you brought a fake ring?"<br/>Serena at that moment spoke up. "No, it is not fake. We tested it, and I even posted about it last night. Many people can testify it is original."<br/>Derek's mouth opened and closed, unsure what to say. "Um, who knows? You are rich, Ms. Serena. You must have bought the original one. That is the one you posted to cover for him."<br/>Serena was obviously angry. In her mind she had already intended to make him lose the partnership. Derek knew that would be certain, so he wanted to do anything to have Mr. Vasilios support him.<br/>Charles said, "My gift will have more weight than anything any of you have ever done."<br/>"Can you please shut the fuck up for just one time? Why are you bragging about what you cannot do!" Derek yelled.<br/>Another person added, "What can he offer that will surpass all that any of us has done when he is just a poor fellow?"<br/>Derek then groaned. "You want to bring something of high value, but it will be fake, just like last time."<br/>Then Mr. Vasilios said, "He cannot even do that because the fake testing machine is here. So he should shut up and leave when we notice."<br/>Charles said, "What if I give something that Ms. Janet will cherish most?"<br/>Ms. Janet, a gentle but no nonsense woman, sniffed. "Look, I do not want to disrespect you, but you can never get what I will cherish most, aside from these shoes Mr. Derek gave me. I do not think you can offer anything other than that."<br/>Derek howled. "YEAH YEAH. Ms. Janet is getting it. He is so useless and can never provide what Ms. Janet will cherish."<br/>"What if I really provide such a thing," Derek said.<br/>"I will really bark like a dog, and I am serious this time. Provide what will make Ms. Janet cherish it and I will bark like a dog!" Derek hollered.<br/>"That will not be like last night when you tried to dodge," someone added.<br/>"That is because what you provided was fake. If you do that now I will ask them to break your leg, so you better be authentic. And I will really bark like a dog," he howled.<br/>Charles faced Ms. Janet and said, "You heard him. Hope you will bear witness. He must do it."<br/>Ms. Janet squinted and said, "Okay. Yeah. But I do not for one moment believe you will give me what I will cherish most."<br/>With both sides clear, Charles smiled and nodded. He brought out his phone and made a call to Lizzy Pie. "You can bring it in now."<br/>Serena waited calmly, wondering what he would do, just as everyone else waited.</div>
