        <h1>chapter 114</h1>
        <div><p>Charles was confused by what Tracy was saying. He scoffed, thinking she was only trying to sound logical because she had no one left and wanted him by her side. The whole story felt too perfect, too convenient. He believed it was a lie, and he wasn’t going to fall for it.</p><p>He said, “I don’t care what you say to make yourself feel better for what you did. You cheated, and that’s it. There is no way you can cajole me.”</p><p>Tracy fired back, “And that is… that’s the reason you didn’t believe me and thought I was in a relationship with Derek. I was never with him. We didn’t even share a kiss. You misunderstood everything!”</p><p>Charles frowned. A thought hit him—what if he really did misunderstand? And also… if what Tracy said was true, then why didn’t she tell him back then? He confronted her with that.</p><p>“That’s because you already made up your mind to leave me. You didn’t care what I would say, and I didn’t see any reason to explain myself to someone who didn’t even trust me.”</p><p>Charles scoffed. Now he understood why she didn’t say anything. Pride. Ego. She believed she was above him, that she owed him no explanation. She had already let him go in her mind and didn’t care.</p><p>Charles brushed it off and said, “No explanation will make me believe you, and that’s it.”</p><p>He turned to leave.</p><p>Tracy held onto his sleeve.</p><p>“Look, Charles. I’ve been wanting to tell you this all this while. I… I believed maybe you were bluffing about divorcing me. I even divorced you, thinking you’d come back to your senses. But you didn’t.” She muttered.</p><p>Charles scoffed again. “Why should I come back into your life? You are not that special. You’re delusional.”</p><p>He turned to leave again, but she didn’t let go.</p><p>“Please just stay with me… this night alone. Please. And forgive me for everything I did. I swear it was all a misunderstanding. Let’s… let’s forget about it and come back together.”</p><p>Charles laughed at the irony. Tracy once swore Charles would be the one to return and regret everything. She bragged back then. Now she was the one begging.</p><p>Charles said, “Not even in our dreams. We’re done, and that’s final.”</p><p>He walked out of the room. Tracy burst into tears.</p><p>On his way out, Charles thought about what Tracy said — that he misunderstood her relationship with Derek. For a moment he paused and wanted to believe it, then he shrugged it off. He believed Tracy was lying.</p><p>When he got to the hotel, Lizzypie smiled.</p><p>“Wow. You finally finished your second mission.”</p><p>Charles didn’t plan to destroy Tracy with that video. His aim was to teach Derek a lesson and expose him. But it worked either way.</p><p>Charles asked, “Will this be enough to destroy her?”</p><p>Lizzypie said, “Actually, this will not do it. We have to add one final touch. Tracy&#x27;s company was involved in illegal activities. Once we expose that, it’s over.”</p><p>Charles was not fine with ruining Tracy’s life and career. After a moment he sighed and said, “Let it go. Let things play out on their own.”</p><p>Lizzypie was amazed and said, “We should just let the momentum go?. This is our moment. The mission will be finished. You can&#x27;t become the Godfather with this weak mind of yours.”</p><p>Charles sighed. What Tracy said about the misunderstanding kept pulling him back. What if she was right? What if he punished her for nothing?</p><p>“We don’t have to do more,” he said. “This is enough.”</p><p>He headed to his bedroom.</p><p>Lizzypie hissed and followed a few steps behind. “A weak fucker,” she muttered to herself. “How is he going to finish ten missions with this faint heart? I have to toughen him up.”</p><p>Charles went to sleep.</p><p>The next morning, as he woke and walked toward the bathroom, he heard the TV.</p><p>The news was reporting that the Zenith Consortium Company, Tracy’s company, was shut down and declared bankruptcy.</p><p>The Reporter explained “After the disgraceful viral sex tape  involving her boyfriend and her mother leaked, the damage to the company has been severe. And this morning, police received a tip about illegal activities inside the company, including tax evasion. Because of that, the company has been closed down. All shareholders, sponsors, and investors have pulled out. Ms. Tracy has no choice but to declare bankruptcy.”</p><p>The reporter continued, voice cold and sharp.</p><p>“Ms. Tracy Hailey, who was among the top ten richest women in the city until yesterday, is now completely ruined. She is not even in the top one hundred anymore. What a shame.”</p><p>The news ended. Charles stood there quietly.</p><p>He didn’t need to think twice, this was Lizzypie’s doing. She had gone ahead and exposed the illegal activities anyway, even after he said to drop it. He didn’t bother calling her out. He didn&#x27;t blame her also, all this was Tracy&#x27;s fault.</p><p>A moment later, the door opened and Lizzypie walked in casually, stretching her arms.</p><p>“Good morning,” she said with a little smile.</p><p>Charles replied plainly, “Morning.”</p><p>She walked closer, “Congratulations… Godfather has officially recognized that you have completed the second mission.”</p><p>Charles blinked.</p><p>Lizzypie lifted her chin a bit.</p><p>“While you await the third mission, the reward has been credited and it was Five billion dollars.”</p><p>Charles’s eyes widened.</p><p>His ears literally twitched from the shock.</p><p>Five billion!! Just like that?</p><p>With that money,  he was comfortably among the richest men in the city!. </p><p>His mind raced. If the Godfather gives him this much, how wealthy is his grandfather really?  What if he became the Godfather himself also. </p><p>He stood there stunned while Lizzypie continued,  “And… you are also given three free accesses to request his help or use his influence.”</p><p>She smiled as she said it, watching his shocked face with satisfaction.</p><p>His face lit up, “You mean, I can use his influence?”</p><p>Lizzypie nodded, “Yeah, but just three times.”</p><p>Charles gulped.</p></div>
