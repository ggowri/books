        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div><p>Charles couldn’t believe Tracy was saying this. Just moments ago, she had been talking about how she regretted leaving him, claiming what happened between them was a big misunderstanding.</p><p>But now, here she was, still blaming him, refusing to hear his side of the story, always siding with Derek.</p><p>Charles insisted, “I will never show gratitude to a liar like him. He doesn’t deserve it.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey scoffed, “Look how hypocritical he is. He knows Derek was better than him but won’t accept it. It’s good you divorced him—he’s a big hypocrite.”</p><p>Charles only scoffed back. The biggest hypocrite here was Mrs. Hailey herself, she was sleeping with her daughter’s lover.</p><p>Just then, Serena, hearing the commotion, stepped forward. Her father had called her earlier and told her he’d contacted one of the Godfather’s subordinates…that was the real reason they were there.</p><p>But now, hearing Derek loudly claiming his own father had made the call made her furious. She demanded instantly,</p><p>“What are you talking about? Who called who?”</p><p>Tracy turned toward her, clearly annoyed. “What’s your business? You were here when your fiancé was dying inside, and Derek called his father, who then called the Godfather to save us! Your fiancé owes him gratitude.”</p><p>Serena scoffed and faced Derek. “Are you serious? That your father called him? Because I was the one who called my father…Mr. Moretti. He was the one who contacted Rain. That’s why he came. So why are you lying?”</p><p>Derek swallowed hard. The truth was, he didn’t even know what he was saying. Yes, he had called his father, but his father had angrily hung up on him, saying there was no way he could contact the Godfather. When Derek later saw help arrive, he convinced himself that it had to have been his father’s doing.</p><p>Now, hearing that Mr. Moretti had been the one who made the call, it was obvious he was wrong. But Derek didn’t want to admit it.</p><p>“I don’t even know what you’re saying. I’m sure my father called him too,” he insisted weakly.</p><p>Lizzy stepped forward and faced him. “Since you’re so sure your father made the call, why don’t you call him right now and put it on speaker for all of us to hear?”</p><p>Derek gulped again and forced a crooked smile. “Why… Why should I do that? Why do I have to prove anything?”</p><p>Serena cut him off. “I can call my father right now and ask him. Can you do the same?”</p><p>Tracy quickly chimed in, rushing to defend Derek. “Why are you all ganging up on him? He said his father called and he’s sure of it. Yet you’re forcing him to prove himself? If he really did prove it, then all of you would have to kneel down before him and apologize!”</p><p>Lizzy smirked and said, “Of course we will kneel. In fact, hell, we will suck your dick if you want. Just make the call.” Her tone was mocking, almost slutty in the way she threw it out.</p><p>Serena folded her arms and added coldly, “Yeah, we will all do it. So call him. Prove to everyone you are not some pathetic loser who lied about knowing the Godfather. Do it now.”</p><p>Tracy turned sharply to Derek, her eyes fierce. “Yes, call him. Show them you are not just talking big. Show them you are not some nobody pretending to have power.”</p><p>Derek scoffed, but sweat was dripping down his back. His façade was fading fast. “My father said he would be in some business meeting… I can’t disturb him right now.”</p><p>Charles sneered. “Such a weak excuse. You don’t even want to try. That says it all.”</p><p>Derek snapped, fury breaking through. “Fuck you all! I regret even calling for help. I’m done. Bye…I’m leaving. Tracy, meet me or not, I don’t care!”</p><p>But as he stormed off, his rage only grew inward. He was furious at himself.</p><p> Furious that he had no proof. Lizzypie and Serena just said they would kneel and suck his dick.  If only his father had true influence, he would have won them all, crushed Charles, and had them worshipping him instead.</p><p>Tracy turned to Charles, her face twisted with scorn. “You keep disappointing me. I should never have come here to save you.” With that, she spun around and stormed off.</p><p>“Tracy!” Charles rushed after her, calling her name.</p><p>She wheeled around, snapping, “What? What do you want? To apologize now? Uhn?”</p><p>Charles let out a low, humorless laugh. He didn’t even have time for this, not really. But he couldn’t shake what she had said earlier…when Tiger almost killed him, Tracy had broken down, crying, saying she should have explained everything sooner. That moment hadn’t left his mind.</p><p>He steadied himself and asked, “You said what happened between us was a big misunderstanding. Can you clear it up now?”</p><p>Tracy’s expression hardened, her voice dripping with disdain. “Explain what? For what you just did, I am more than grateful I divorced you. I don’t regret it for a second. You are a horrible excuse for a man!. poor, pathetic, and still bragging like you are worth something.”</p><p>Charles just nodded. So disappointed in her, that she was still a woman full of spite and pride, would never admit she was wrong, and always wanted to prove a point.</p><p>“Okay then,&quot; He said, and swiftly turned, leaving her alone.</p><p>“You are pathetic!  I hate you!”She kept shouting, as Charles didn&#x27;t even bother responding.</p><p></p></div>
