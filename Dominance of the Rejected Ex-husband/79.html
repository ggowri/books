        <h1>Chapter 79</h1>
        <div><p>All heads turned to see Ms. Janet walking toward them. </p><p>Ms. Janet was Mr. Vasilios’ daughter — the same woman whose Charles had surprised his fiancée with a portrait of his father back then.</p><p>As soon as she approached, everyone bowed to her.</p><p>“Ms. Janet, welcome,” the guard greeted respectfully.</p><p>Janet wore a frown. She had been observing everything and had witnessed it all.</p><p>Her voice was sharp as she demanded, “Hey, did you just try to beat him? You raised your hand to hit someone,  for what reason?”</p><p>Norman chuckled and quickly chimed in, “Oh, Ms. Janet, they just wanted to teach him a lesson. He came here to see Mr. Vasilios without any appointment. And instead of explaining himself, he was being stubborn, even insulting the security guards.” He sprinkled his lies smoothly.</p><p>Janet’s frown deepened. She had seen everything and knew Norman was lying. She also respected Charles since the engagement party — she still remembered how he had impressed her.</p><p>Even though she knew the truth, she turned to the guard. “Can you tell me what happened?”</p><p>The head security guard immediately replied, “Yes, ma’am. He was so arrogant and wouldn’t take simple instructions. He tried to force his way in, so I had to teach him a lesson.”</p><p>Janet smiled faintly. “Really?”</p><p>“Yeah, he’s just a useless, foolish somebody. Please have him dragged out,” Norman added smugly. He didn’t know the history between them and kept bad-mouthing Charles.</p><p>Then he leaned toward Charles and whispered, “Finally, you’ve humiliated yourself. You should’ve left when you had the chance.”</p><p>Janet turned to the second security guard, who was standing idly by. “Tell me — what really happened here?”</p><p>Norman and the first guard shot the second one a dangerous glare. He immediately felt pressured, their eyes burning into him. He didn’t want to lie, but fear held him back.</p><p>Janet stepped closer. “You  better talk now. I want everything  and don’t you dare lie!”</p><p>He exhaled shakily and finally spoke. “Ma’am… Mr. Norman here was claiming that this man was just a random nobody and that we shouldn’t let him in. Dylan was only following his orders and tried to beat him up.” </p><p>Dylan was the bad guard name.</p><p>“So he wasn’t trying to force his way in or being arrogant?”</p><p>“No, ma’am. I’d even say Mr. Norman was the arrogant one,” the guard confessed fully.</p><p>Janet smirked, satisfied, That was exactly what she had seen. She had only wanted to hear it directly.</p><p>The first guard suddenly blurted out, “No, ma’am, he’s lying—”</p><p>SMACK!</p><p>Janet’s hand struck across his face. He held his cheek, stunned.</p><p>“Shut your mouth and stop lying! I saw everything. You’re following orders from someone who has no authority in this company. You’re a disgrace to security officers. In fact, people like you could let robbers in, just because you follow anyone who gives orders!”</p><p>Norman gulped. The guard trembled.</p><p>“I repeat — you are a disgrace! And for what you did, you’re fired!” Janet’s voice rang through the room.</p><p>Everyone went silent.</p><p>Mr. Vasilios had always made it clear: Janet’s words carried the same authority as his. Whatever she said was final.</p><p>The guard fell to his knees, pleading.</p><p>“No, please, ma’am! Don’t fire me! This job it’s the best-paying one I’ve ever seen. I won’t survive without it. Please, I beg you!”</p><p>Janet’s expression didn’t soften.</p><p>“Next time,” she said coldly, “you will learn to take your work seriously. In whatever job you get next,”</p><p>She raised a finger toward the exit.</p><p>“Now get out of here before I call the inner guards on you.”</p><p>“Oh no… no, please!” he cried again, his voice cracking, but her stare made him freeze. He knew it was over. But he kept pleading.</p><p>Janet turned to the second guard—the honest one.</p><p>“You,” she said, her tone shifting. “You displayed courage. You didn’t fear them, and you followed protocol. You didn’t let greed or pressure overcome you.”</p><p>The guard blinked, stunned.</p><p>“For that,” she continued, “you will be promoted to the inner guards. That means a higher salary and some extra benefits.&quot;</p><p>The man’s jaw dropped. “What! Really? Wow… thank you, ma’am! I—I’m just grateful. Thank you so much!”</p><p>His joy burst out uncontrollably; he couldn’t stop smiling.</p><p>The fired guard, standing by the door, froze in regret. His eyes filled with tears as the weight of his loss sank in.</p><p>Norman just stood there, speechless. He’d watched everything right in front of him. Once again, Charles had somehow turned the situation around—defeating him without lifting a hand.</p><p>Janet finally faced Norman.</p><p>“Mr. Norman,” she said firmly, “I respect you. I know how influential you are, and I value that. But I can see you’re in bad standing with Mr. Charles. That doesn’t give you the right to impose your will on the guards or twist company protocol.”</p><p>Her tone hardened.</p><p>“For that, please leave for now. Come back another day when you’ve calmed down.”</p><p>Norman’s face tightened. </p><p>Norman stiffened, his jaw twitching.</p><p>“No,” he said quickly, shaking his head. “I have to see your father, Ms. Vasilios. I need to discuss something important with him.”</p><p>Janet’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Then you shouldn’t have caused trouble in front of this house,” she replied sharply. “If you truly needed to see him, you should’ve acted with respect.”</p><p>Norman’s pride cracked. He lowered his tone.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “Please… forgive me.”</p><p>Janet crossed her arms. “Mr. Norman, I’m not the one you should be apologizing to.”</p><p>He blinked. “W-what?”</p><p>She pointed toward Charles, her gaze firm.</p><p>“It’s him. You insulted him, humiliated him, and almost had him beaten. Bow, and apologize. Do that and I will let you in.”</p><p>The air went still.</p><p>Norman’s throat bobbed as he swallowed. </p><p></p></div>
