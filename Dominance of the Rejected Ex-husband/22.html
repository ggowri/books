        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div>Charles gulped as he hid behind Serena. Just then, oddly, she asked for a gun from one of her bodyguards, who handed her a pistol. She instantly faced Charles and shoved it into his hands. Charles raised his shaking hand.<br/>“Who the hell are you?” she demanded.<br/>“Uhm, someone who just saved you. I… I saved you!” he stammered.<br/>“You popped out of nowhere and beat ten guys with guns. What’s your real agenda here? Who are you, really?” she pressed.<br/>“I’m nobody! I… I was just passing by and saw a woman who needed help, so I helped.” He shouted.<br/>Serena scoffed. “I don’t need help — who told you that? I can handle them without you. Oh… you saved me for attention?”<br/>Charles swallowed; it was sort of true, but he tried to sound brave. “I don’t even know who the hell you are. Fuck you!” he snapped.<br/>The captain moved as if to intervene, but Serena stopped him and asked, “Give me your full name.”<br/>“Charles Thompson,” he said, his real name, without the new surname.<br/>“Run information on him,” she ordered the captain. He immediately bowed and got to work.<br/>Serena still pointed the gun at him. “Why are you out here by yourself if you have bodyguards? You nearly got killed.”<br/>“Shut the fuck up. I just wanted to watch the sunset. Can’t I move around by myself? I just want to live like a normal person, like everyone else. Is that so hard?” Charles snapped.<br/>Charles could see the pain in her eyes. She really wanted normalcy. She looked exhausted. She was well known; everyone wished to live her life. Yet here she was, wishing to live like everyone else.<br/>Then the captain returned. “Nothing suspicious. He’s a firefighter, a delivery man, and a hotel attendant. He was poor and Just got divorced yesterday. He seems good at his job… he was one of the firefighters who stopped the Westland fire.”<br/>At the mention of Westland, Serena softened a little. She had bought a large property in Westland as an investment; a fire had broken out there and, she knew, it had been targeted. Many houses were affected, but the damage was minimized thanks to the firefighters’ efforts. That earned Charles some sympathy.<br/>Charles was surprised how they could gather his information in just a minute.<br/>“Okay… but I still find it strange. I will let you live for today. But if I see you near me one more time, I will kill you,” she warned, cold and deadly.<br/>But Charles saw this as a big opportunity to get closer to her. He wouldn’t let it go to waste. His mission was to get engaged to her. He had to take any chance.<br/>“Uhm… since I saved you, why don’t you make me your bodyguard?” he asked.<br/>The captain exploded with anger. “Screw you! Are you crazy? Who sent you? You want to stay close to her. Do you know who she is? Heiress Serena!!!”<br/>Charles said, “I just want a good-paying job. I saved your life today. I can see you are a wealthy woman; you can pay me well. Please, I just need work.”<br/>Serena sized him up and down. She did not want to believe him yet. “I am having my birthday party tomorrow. Come then and we will talk,” she said.<br/>“Really? How will I get in?” Charles asked.<br/>“I am not the one with the invitation,” Serena replied. “Fred, the captain, will be at the gate. He will let you in.”<br/>Charles smiled. “Okay. I will be there.”<br/>“If you are here for anything bad, stop now. I will know. So you better not bother to come or else, I will kill you,” Serena warned.<br/>Charles scoffed. “Oh, okay. I am all set. Tomorrow then. Let us meet tomorrow.” He left. As he walked away, Serena watched him go. She had never seen someone so skilled; he had caught her attention and she wanted to know more about him.<br/>Then she faced the captain. “The Bone Fraternity is behind this. Someone must have ordered them. Prepare to massacre them all,” she said.<br/>Charles arrived back at the hotel thrilled by what had happened. He had spent all night thinking how he would even get the chance to talk to Serena. <br/>For her to invite him to her birthday was a huge step for him. But at the same time, he was scared. Serena ordered people to be massacred. She was cold and merciless. He knew he had to be careful around her.<br/>The next day came faster than he expected. He immediately prepared and picked one of his best outfits. Even then, it obviously looked cheap. He had no choice.<br/>He arrived at the Moretti estate; guests were streaming in, each with their invitation card.<br/>Charles stood at the gate and was about to enter when one of the two guards stopped him.<br/>“Where is your invitation card?” the guard demanded, frowning.<br/>Charles looked around, searching for Fred’s face… the one Serena said would be there. But he couldn’t find him.<br/>“I asked. Where is the invitation card? Are you lost? This is the birthday event of the heiress Serena; there is no entry without an invitation. What’s with that outfit?” the guard yelled.<br/>“It’s Ms. Serena who invited me herself. She said I would meet the captain, Fred. Call him here,” Charles said.<br/>“Are you a spy? How would Ms. Serena invite you without an invitation card? How do you know Master Fred? You must be a spy! Go back now — I will break your bones!” The guard was rude and aggressive.<br/>Charles was about to speak when a voice called from behind.<br/>“Charles?”<br/>He turned to see Mrs. Hailey. Mrs. Hailey was Tracy’s mother. </div>
