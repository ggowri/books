        <h1>chapter 43</h1>
        <div>“Uh… say that again,” Lizzy said, pretending like she didn’t hear him the first time.<br/>Charles meant heavily to repeat what he just said.<br/>Finally, he summoned his courage and just let it out. “I said you should sleep with me. I think you know that’s the way of activating the Eye of Satan Level 2. Isn’t it?”<br/>Lizzypie let out a dirty smirk and replied, “I knew you were lusting after me right from the start we met. If only you had not blown your chance by looking down on me, I should have even taken you myself. But now… it’s over.”<br/>Charles groaned. “But you yourself know that’s the only way to activate Level 2. Why can’t you help me with it?”<br/>Lizzypie shrugged. “Why should I help you with it? You can go meet Serena, your fiancée.”<br/>Charles knew Lizzypie was teasing him. The engagement between him and Serena was fake, and seriously, if he dared propose this to her, she could put a bullet in his head.<br/>“I will let you sleep with me… unless…” Lizzypie hung it up with a smirk.<br/>Charles impatiently asked, “Unless what?… huh?”<br/>“Unless you are able to fight me and overpower me. I will give you any style you want… I will drive you wild,” she said in a flirty way.<br/>Charles frowned and said, “Really, you said that yourself!”<br/>“Of course.” She then stood up as they made their way to the open space. “Okay, bring it on.”<br/>Charles’ eyeballs split.<br/>Eye of Satan — Level One Activated.<br/>Then, Charles was ready. He had fought some thirty thugs today, so he wasn’t even afraid or scared of Lizzypie. In fact, he thought that Lizzypie was just pulling his leg so she wouldn’t seem cheap.<br/>With the eye, everything became slow, and he was ready to fight.<br/>He lunged first, throwing a straight punch at her jaw. Lizzypie leaned back with effortless grace, letting his fist sail past before driving her heel into his stomach.<br/>The wind left him in a harsh whoosh as he stumbled back, landing on one knee. “Ouch!”<br/>“Try again,” she teased him.<br/>Charles stood up again, another punch. Feinting left, he swung right. His punch grazed her shoulder but she pivoted, grabbed his wrist mid-swing, and twisted him sideways. He tumbled, hitting the ground hard.<br/>Breathing hard, Charles realized Lizzypie wasn’t just teasing. She had her own power. Every move she made was precise, almost premeditated, as if she could see the next second before it happened.<br/>“Try again,” she said again, amusement dancing in her eyes.<br/>Each time Charles tried fighting her, it was just impossible for him. The last punch he threw, Lizzypie caught it and performed Judo on him, throwing him up and then painfully down.<br/>“Looks like you won’t get me after all tonight, you are really not up to me,” she taunted.<br/>“Ahh… uhh… my back,” he suddenly groaned, holding his back like it had broken. Lizzypie immediately rushed to him.<br/>“Charles… what’s wrong… what…” Before she could know it, Charles had tricked her. He grabbed her hand and swiftly threw her to the other side then pinned her down.<br/>“I win, I finally overpowered you!”<br/>Lizzypie shrieked. “Ahhh, you are a cheater! You cheat!”<br/>But who cares, he won, and that was the only objective.<br/>——<br/>After the fierce fight ended with Charles’ cheap victory, he threw Lizzypie onto the couch and began tearing at his own clothes.<br/>“You… you little cheat! You didn’t win fair and square!” Lizzypie panted, struggling for breath.<br/>“Who gives a damn?” Charles growled, his voice low and smug. “I won, and you’re mine now.”<br/>“You idiot,” she whimpered, but her body arched toward him as his hands found her full breasts. He took her nipple into his mouth.<br/>“Oh… you beast!” Lizzypie cried out as he began to suck, her complaints melting into moans. Desire burned in her eyes.<br/>He pushed her down as she wrapped her legs around his waist. Charles moved against her, breath ragged, body hungry. She was soaked, her lips eagerly working his cock like a starved pup. He kneaded her heavy breasts, thrusting into her as Lizzypie screamed, her eyes rolling back in ecstasy.<br/>But then he froze.Lizzypie was a virgin.<br/>She gasped as he hit her hymen, breaking through. Her fingers dug into his hair, yanking hard.<br/>In that moment, Charles understood. His father sent Lizzypie for a reason—to help him awaken the second level of the Eye of Satan. Tracy’s virginity had unlocked Level One. Now, another pure soul would open Level Two.<br/>Lizzypie’s skin tasted intoxicating—like ice cream melting on his tongue, cool and sweet like a rare flower.<br/>"Don't stop, Charles," she begged, her voice thick with need as her full hips rocked beneath him in a raw, instinctual rhythm.<br/>He drove into her faster, harder, flipping her over and gripping her tightly as he moved without restraint.<br/>With a final groan, he came, his strong body pressed tightly against hers as he released inside her.<br/>Lizzypie‘s beautiful back arched off the couch, a raw, guttural cry tearing from her throat as she clenched around him, milking every last drop from his pulsing length. <br/>"F-fill me..." she slurred, her body trembling with the force of her own climax.<br/>Then everything went dark. The world dissolved into an empty haze. A voice echoed in his mind:<br/>“Eye of Satan… Level Two… Activated.”“X-ray Activated!”Charles smirked. “Well, damn. I did it.”<br/>xxxx<br/>After some minutes, they were finally done. Charles lay down on the bed. He stared as Lizzypie came out from the bathroom with just a towel.<br/>X-ray activated.<br/>He stared at her and could see everything under the towel — Lizzypie’s full body, her large breasts and curved body.<br/>Even though he had just had her some moments ago, he couldn’t let his eyes go away.<br/>To the extent that Lizzypie noticed him, “Hey you… why do you keep staring? Isn’t it okay when you already pounded me? Your eyes will pop off if you keep that up.”<br/>He immediately averted his eyes.<br/>“Look, you just activated Level Two and you have to train it well. For now, it’s weak, and you won’t be able to use it more than three times per day, with at least a 10 minutes interval for cooling period. If you keep forcing it and using it, your eyes will literally pop off,” Lizzypie told him.<br/>He immediately shut it off. He had already used it the second time.<br/>“So stop leering over me. If you want me again, you will have to earn it again. And it will be fierce this time,” she said.<br/>Charles immediately looked away from here because seeing LIzzpie's body could drive someone mad. <br/>Just then his phone rang beside him. He froze, wondering who could be calling him late at night. He checked it only to see Mrs. Hailey. Tracy’s mother?<br/>What the hell could she be calling for at that spot? He thought before he hesitated and picked it up.<br/>“Hey you, fucker. You better save my daughter. You caused all this, now my daughter is in danger because of you!” Mrs. Hailey cried out.</div>
