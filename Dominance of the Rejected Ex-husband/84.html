        <h1>Chapter 84</h1>
        <div><p>Mr. Vasilios stared at Charles. Even Janet and Kyle knew how big Charles’s request was. Letting Mr. Moretti go would cost him many businesses that paid area dues. They would stop doing business with him, and he would lose a lot.</p><p>But Charles had told him he would need to keep treating Kyle for three months. He knew that if he angered Charles now it would look bad. It would seem ungrateful, and Charles might not want to treat his son again.</p><p>He gulped as he took in the situation. He thought about it. Charles hadn’t asked for money for treating his son. He had saved the boy’s life. Before Mr. Vasilios could answer, Janet spoke.</p><p>“What you are asking is very big. But I understand — you are acting like a son-in-law for Mr. Moretti.” She faced her father. “Father, I think we should do it. He did a lot to treat Kyle.”</p><p>Kyle added, “Father, please do this for me. He isn’t asking for much. Please, I beg you — do this for me.”</p><p>Mr. Vasilios sighed and looked at Charles. “You are damn smart and good — I’ll give you that. I understand what you did. You went all the way to find a cure for an ‘incurable’ sickness just to make a deal. I respect you. So I will accept your offer. From now on we won’t charge the Moretti family. I don’t care about the outcome, as long as my son is well.”</p><p>Charles bowed. “Thanks, sir. I’m really happy.”</p><p>“I will give you a formal signed paper saying I won’t collect money from you again,” Mr. Vasilios said. That made Charles even happier. </p><p>Mr. Vasilios prepared the paper, signed it, and handed it to Charles. </p><p>Charles bowed in thanks. They even exchanged numbers in case help was needed before Mr. Vasilios left. He also told him to keep it a secret that he was the one that treat his son. </p><p>---</p><p>Charles returned home, so happy. He kept looking at the letter. With it, he could stay Serena’s fiancé and would not be scared of being thrown out — of having his work undone. He whistled as he opened the door.</p><p>Inside was Lizzy. She faced the window and was deep in a phone call. She did not notice Charles. He crept up behind her.</p><p>“Okay… I understand. Don’t worry. Just leave me alone. I won’t sleep with any man again… okay, bye.” She hung up and sighed.</p><p>“Who was that?” Charles asked. Lizzy started, then jumped and turned around. She was so shocked to see Charles.</p><p>“Oh, you are back.”</p><p>Charles frowned a little. “Who was that, Lizzy?”</p><p>She froze, then put on an awkward smile. “No one. Just… a friend.”</p><p>“There’s clearly something,” Charles said, watching her closely. “You’ve been acting strange lately. Who were you talking to?”</p><p>Lizzy folded her arms. “Why should I report to you?”</p><p>He chuckled softly, trying to lighten it. “Because I’m your husband — and you are my first wife.”</p><p>Lizzy scoffed. “Please, don’t start. It’s nothing serious. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>Charles’s smile faded. “But what I heard didn’t sound like anything. You said something about not sleeping with any man again. What was that about?”</p><p>Lizzy’s eyes darted away. “I said it’s okay,” she snapped quickly. “Please, just let it go.”</p><p>Charles studied her for a long second, the room suddenly quiet. He could tell she was hiding something — but for now, he said nothing.</p><p>LizzyPie noticed the documents in his hand. “Wow, the pill worked!” she gasped when she saw the paper.</p><p>Charles smiled and nodded. “Yeah, we made it. It worked instantly, and he’s doing perfectly fine. The Nytheris stone works like magic.”</p><p>“Now you can stop worrying — Ms. Serena will be yours,” she said with a smile.</p><p>“Yeah, though it’s fake,” he reminded her.</p><p>“Mm, it’s not,” she teased, then told him to rest and go show the family the signed file in the morning. After that, she walked away.</p><p>Charles narrowed his eyes, still thinking about who LizzyPie had been talking to. It was obvious now — she’d been avoiding him, especially in bed.</p><p>“That explains why she’s been turning me down,” he muttered to himself. “I will find out what’s going on.”</p><p>****</p><p>The next morning, Charles arrived at the Moretti building with the signed paper in hand. The guards at the gate recognized him right away and didn’t hesitate.</p><p>“Good morning, sir,” one of them said, opening the gate. </p><p>Charles walked straight to the family meeting room where one of the maids said they were.</p><p>As he knocked on the door, it was opened by a maid. Charles walked in slowly.</p><p>The family, who were seated at the dining table, froze the moment they saw him. Serena looked just as shocked as everyone else.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Collins was the first to speak, his face tightening with a frown.</p><p>Charles started, “I—”</p><p>“Just shut up!” Collins snapped. “You were told to come here only if you got the deal from Mr. Vasilios. Are you here to back out of the bet? I knew you were just bluffing the other day.”</p><p>Allison added with a smirk, “Yeah, he was here bragging the other day like he could do something. Now look at him — standing there like a fool.”</p></div>
