        <h1>Chapter 103</h1>
        <div><p>Mr. Edward slammed his fist against the table. Glasses rattled. Conversations died.</p><p>“Looks like we’re all thinking the same thing, right?” he thundered. “Norman’s making a lot of sense. We should search him thoroughly!”</p><p>A chorus of agreement followed instantly.</p><p>“Yes, search him.”</p><p>“That’s the only way to be sure.”</p><p>“He has to prove himself innocent if he’s truly clean.”</p><p>The crowd began to tighten around Charles. The atmosphere turned harsh—whispers slicing through the room like knives.</p><p>Serena’s voice cut through the noise, sharp and furious. “What the hell is wrong with all of you? I can testify he’s been with me the whole time! Whatever you’re saying doesn’t make any sense. He can’t steal that watch!”</p><p>Norman turned, his smirk shifting to a sickeningly sweet facade of concern. &quot;Open your eyes, Serena. He&#x27;s beneath you. You bring him here, and all he does is steal?&quot;</p><p>Serena glared at him. “Aside from you, who else saw him here? No one! And you think that makes sense?”</p><p>Then a voice rose from the back. “Actually… I saw him come around the table.”</p><p>Every head turned. The speaker stepped forward—Derek.</p><p>Norman’s eyes widened for a moment. He hadn’t expected Derek to back him up, but now that he did, the accusation had weight. Real weight. </p><p>Mr. Edward leaned forward. “Mister man, are you sure of what you’re saying?”</p><p>Derek crossed his arms. “Why would I lie? I saw him. I’m sure you saw him too,” he said, turning toward Mrs. Hailey.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey blinked, caught off guard. She hadn’t seen anything, neither had Derek, but she understood the game. The chance to humiliate Charles was too tempting.</p><p>“Y-yes,” she stammered, then grew louder. “Yes, I saw him too! As we entered, we saw him walk around the table!”</p><p>The murmurs turned to solid voices. The crowd nodded, faces tightening with false certainty.</p><p>Norman spread his hands. “See? I told you all.”</p><p>The room was now fully against Charles—pressure closing in from all sides. Serena’s face went pale.</p><p>People began whispering again, the noise swelling like a low tide of judgment.</p><p>“There’s no way three people would be wrong,” someone said.</p><p>“Exactly,” another added. “He must have come to the table.”</p><p>Tracy stood frozen, terror written all over her face. Serena too, her breath shallow, her mind spinning. Could Charles really do this? The thought scared her even to imagine.</p><p>Mr. Edward’s voice cut through the murmurs. “Mr. Charles, this is getting serious. You don’t want unnecessary accusations, right? Let’s just search your body and end this.”</p><p>Serena snapped, furious. “That’s disrespectful! You all can’t just touch him like that. Check the CCTV instead!”</p><p>At that, Norman’s heart sank. The CCTV… fuck. He hadn’t thought about that.</p><p>Mr. Edward frowned. “Right, CCTV. Good idea.” He turned, scanning the corners of the hall. Everyone looked up—only to see nothing.</p><p>A guard stepped forward, bowing slightly. “Sir, we don’t have CCTV cameras installed in this section. Management prefers to keep guests comfortable. We respect privacy.”</p><p>Norman exhaled softly in relief. “Well,” he said, voice firm again, “our only option now is to search his body.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Derek said quickly. “Go through his body.”</p><p>Mrs. Hailey crossed her arms. “I’m sure he took it.”</p><p>Serena’s anger flared. “No one is touching him inappropriately! You’ve all lost your minds.”</p><p>Tracy’s voice broke through. “Why are you shielding him, Serena? If he’s innocent, this won’t hurt. Let them search him.”</p><p>Charles turned his head toward her slowly. There was no anger in his face—just a calm, sharp smile that silenced her.</p><p> “It’s okay,” he said quietly. “Let them come and search me.”</p><p>Norman grinned like a wolf who’d finally cornered his prey. He stepped forward quickly, reaching for Charles.</p><p>But the moment his hand brushed Charles’s jacket, Charles caught his wrist, twisted it, and shoved him backward. “Get away from me,” he said, voice low and dangerous. “You don’t touch me. I don’t want you to search me.”</p><p>Norman stumbled back, his pride burning hotter than the pain in his arm. “You crazy thief!” he shouted. “You are just a pauper—a poor man who stole a million-dollar watch and now you are afraid to be searched!”</p><p>Charles’s jaw clenched. “I’m not afraid,” he said evenly. “I just don’t want you doing it. Let the guards handle it.”</p><p>The crowd hushed again.</p><p>“He seems suspicious, I&#x27;m sure the thing is with him”.</p><p>“I can bet it, he stole it”.</p><p>The guards stepped forward, their boots soft against the marble floor. They bowed slightly toward Charles.</p><p>“We’re sorry, sir,” the lead guard said respectfully. “But we’ll have to go through you.”</p><p>Charles nodded. “Sure. Go ahead.”</p><p>He raised his hands and spread them wide, calm and unflinching. The room was so quiet that even the sound of his shirt rustling seemed loud. Serena stood to the side, one hand over her mouth, waiting anxiously. Norman, meanwhile, stood motionless—arms folded, confidence carved into his smirk. He was already imagining the moment they’d pull the watch from Charles’s pocket.</p><p>The guards began their search. They checked every fold of his jacket, every pocket, every seam. They went through his sleeves, his shoes, even the inner lining of his trousers. The air thickened with tension as people leaned forward, waiting for the verdict.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>The lead guard looked up, then turned to the others. They shook their heads. He straightened, faced the crowd, and said, “There’s nothing on him.”</p><p>A ripple of disbelief spread through the room.</p><p>Norman’s face twitched. “What the hell are you saying?” he snapped. “He has it! Check him properly!”</p><p>“We did,” the lead guard replied firmly. “Carefully. But we found nothing. If he really did steal it, it isn’t on him now.”</p><p>Norman thought ‘No! That can’t be! I put it in his pocket.’ </p><p>Then he said loudly ,  &quot;It&#x27;s in his pocket!”</p><p>Charles turned his head slowly, eyes narrowing. His voice was calm. “Why are you so convinced I put it there, Norman?”</p><p>Norman pointed at him, his composure cracking. “Because I saw you. You put it in your pocket—I know what I saw!”</p></div>
