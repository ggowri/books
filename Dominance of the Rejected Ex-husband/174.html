        <h1>Chapter 174</h1>
        <div>For many minutes, no one dared  move.<br/>Razor’s men stood frozen where they were, their eyes locked on the smoking hole in their master’s chest, then on Charles, then back at each other.<br/> Their throat gulped up and down as they took some steps backward. They whispered to each other. <br/>“He’s a monster…”<br/> “He just killed Master Razor…” <br/>“With his eyes…”<br/>“He is superman”.<br/>Their blood ran cold. <br/>Charles dropped his head forward and sucked in air like a drowning man. His chest heaved hard.<br/>His hands shook as the red glow in his eyes faded slowly.<br/>Reaper snapped out of it first. He ran towards him. Zander followed right behind him. <br/>“Boss!” Reaper’s voice cracked as he grabbed his shoulder. <br/>“Are you okay!”.<br/>Charles laughed weakly,  and pushed himself upright. His legs wobbled but he forced them straight, though he was so weak and drained of energy, he refused to fall in front of everyone.<br/>“I’m fine,” he said.<br/>He reached into his coat with slow fingers and pulled out a small glass vial, filled with thick liquid that shimmered faintly.<br/> LizzyPie’s face flashed through his mind. She had pressed it into his palm before he left, to use it to cure his wound. <br/>He uncorked it and drank. The effect was instant.<br/>Charles stiffened as a low groan tore out of his throat. His body arched and bones shifted under his skin, snapping back into place one after another. He was perfectly fine. <br/>Reaper stumbled back in shock. Zander’s mouth fell open. How could something  be cured so fast like that?<br/>The men watching forgot how to blink.<br/>Meanwhile Charles stood up like nothing happened.<br/>“Wow. Lizzypie is truly a sorcerer ”.<br/>She told him she spent 3 million dollars for the ingredients and a full 2 days just to make that small liquid.  <br/>Charles turned to face Mr. Damien’s men and they were still breaking, sweat running down their faces, hands shaking so badly some almost lost their grip, a few looking like they might wet themselves right there.<br/>The image of Razor’s smoking chest was still fresh, the red glow still burned in their minds, those eyes alone could wipe them out in a single breath.<br/>“I shouldn’t have to tell you,” Charles said calmly, “before dropping your weapons.”<br/>Metal clattered to the ground all at once, guns and blades hitting the floor without a second of hesitation because none of them wanted to be the next hole in the air.<br/>Charles smiled and turned to Zander and Reaper.<br/>“Tie each and every one of them, and no one should call Mr. Damien, I want to surprise him myself.”<br/>“Yes master,” they both yelled.<br/>Charles walked away as the men lowered their heads, every single one of them bowing.<br/>*****<br/>Meanwhile in the New york, Mr. Moretti had gathered a grand party to honor Mr. Damien who was visiting their city, and the moment word spread of his arrival, everyone rushed to the banquet, eager to be seen, eager to connect, eager to earn a place beside his name.<br/>Mr. Damien enjoyed the attention, unaware of what was unfolding back home.<br/>In one corner of the hall, Mr. Moretti stood close to Serena, his face tight with anger, his voice low but sharp.<br/>“What are you still standing here for,” he snapped, “I told you to go and greet Mr. Damien now.”<br/>Serena crossed her arms. “Why should I.”<br/>Mr. Moretti glared at her. “Because you are my daughter, and he knows you, if you don't greet him, he might take it as an insult.”<br/>“Why would he be angry over that,” Serena said.<br/>Mr. Moretti leaned closer. “Look at me. I gave Collins the CEO position because he proved himself worthy, while you were busy dancing around that nonsense man, and I know exactly why you’re refusing to greet Mr. Damien, it’s because of him.”<br/>Serena’s eyes hardened.<br/>“If you refuse to do what I say,” he continued, “I will cut all your expenses, my support, everything I’ve ever given you, and you will end up with nothing.”<br/>“Father,” Serena said, her voice shaking, “why are you doing this, calling Charles nothing after everything he has done for us.”<br/>Mr. Moretti scoffed. “Whatever he has done is nothing compared to what Mr. Damien will do for us and this company, so you better act right or I will do exactly what I threatened you with.”<br/>They were still locked in that tense exchange when a calm voice cut in beside them.<br/>“Well,” Mr. Damien said with a smile, “isn’t this your beautiful daughter.”<br/>He laughed lightly. “Oh yeah, she is. Serena. Serena, meet Mr. Damien.”<br/>Serena bowed with a tight fake smile, anger simmering under her skin.<br/>Mr. Damien nodded slowly. “Wow, your daughter has grown beautifully.”<br/>They smiled, but Mr. Damien's eyes didn’t stay polite, they dragged over her figure, lingered too long on her hips, her legs, he licked his lips, and even crossed his legs because his cock was rising. Serena caught it instantly, her jaw tightening with anger. <br/>How could a man be this improper? <br/>“I heard you are engaged,” Mr. Damien said. “Where is he?”<br/>Before she could speak, Mr. Moretti stepped in. “They broke up. He was a foolish man chasing her money.”<br/>“Father—” Serena snapped, but he cut her off.<br/>“He’s gone and he won’t bother you anymore.”<br/>Serena clenched her fists, her anger rising.<br/>Mr. Damien chuckled, staring at Serena. “That’s what’s wrong with young men these days, they don’t know how to treat a princess like you.”<br/>Serena said nothing.<br/>“Imagine if you were with me,” he continued smoothly, “you would never lack anything, and I would give my full support to you and your father.”<br/>Serena frowned, and even Mr. Moretti shifted uncomfortably.<br/>Mr. Damien smiled wider. “You are beautiful, Serena, and I wouldn’t mind taking you as my wife.”<br/>He grew bolder, too comfortable, too sure of himself, and then his hand slid down and grabbed Serena in her ass!.<br/>Serena turned and slapped him across the face.<br/>Smack!!!</div>
