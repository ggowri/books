        <h1>chapter 130</h1>
        <div>Wilson was informed about the commotion.<br/>Heavy footsteps echoed from the staircase, then he appeared with Norman beside him. Norman’s right hand was wrapped thick in bandages. Both men stared down at the scene of broken guards.<br/>Wilson scowled. “Who the hell is causing trouble in my company?”<br/>Then he saw Charles.<br/>A slow grin spread across his face. “Wow. You came here yourself. I can’t believe it. Saves me the stress of hunting you.”<br/>Norman froze, then hissed when he recognized him. “Wilson… that bastard. This is the bastard I always tell you about. He’s the one who broke my hand.”<br/>Wilson raised a brow. “So you are that guy. You are quite something. Walking into a place where you know your life could end.”<br/>Norman stepped forward, voice shaking with anger. “Wilson, kill him. He keeps trampling on us. He doesn’t even have a family background. He’s a nobody. A useless poor idiot. We need to put him in his place.”<br/>Wilson stepped more forward,  “The Only thing that can save you from this, is if you are here to return my stones. Or else, consider yourself dead!”.<br/>Charles watched them quietly for a moment. Then he spoke.<br/>“We paid you for the stone,” he said. “You gave us a fake. I returned it and got the real one. We didn’t steal anything. So why did you attack Tracy and destroy her company?”<br/>Wilson burst out laughing. “Listen to this clown running his mouth. Who do you think you are, some kind of hero?. Captain America?”<br/>Norman sneered. “So you came here because of a woman? You walked into the place where they are planning to kill you because of some bitch? No wonder all those women cling to you. You are simp. A free tool.”<br/>Charles stayed calm.<br/>“I’m not here to fight,” he said. “You destroyed Tracy’s company. I want money for the damage.”<br/>Wilson and Norman burst into loud laughter. Their voices echoed through the entire floor.<br/>“Hahaha! Look at this idiot,” Norman said. “What do you think you are? Even your good fighting skills won’t save you today, and you are still running your mouth.”<br/>Wilson shook his head. “This man must be insane. You actually came here to demand money from me? From me? And you think I will give you anything?”<br/>Charles answered, steady and cold. “Yes. You will. Even on your knees.”<br/>They laughed harder.<br/>Norman wiped his eyes. “Wilson, just tell the boys to kill him already. After that, we can take those two baddies of his. They are hot as hell. We will enjoy them after he’s gone.”<br/>Wilson grinned like it was nothing. Even though this was a corporate building, both men acted like street thugs, wild and careless. But no employee dared speak. This was the Titan Family. Everyone in the company knew exactly what they had signed up for.<br/>Wilson stepped closer, voice low with arrogance. “I will kill you. And nothing will happen. Now hand over my stone and I might let you leave this place alive.”<br/>Charles stood firm. “You are not listening. You will give me money for the damage you caused.”<br/>Wilson groaned. “You are still talking crazy.”<br/>He raised his hand.<br/>Instantly, the floor shifted.<br/>Ten thugs surrounded Charles from every angle, all armed with guns. One even held a grenade. On the second-floor balcony, five snipers appeared. Their laser dots danced across Charles’ chest, neck, and forehead.<br/>A web of red light wrapped around him.<br/>Norman grinned wider. “Even that fast-movement skill you always pull won’t save you now. You are done.”<br/>Charles looked at all the guns pointed at him, then at Wilson and Norman.<br/>His jaw tightened.<br/>His eyes sharpened.<br/>Wilson raised a finger. “I’m going to start a countdown. If you don’t surrender by the time I reach three, consider yourself gone.”<br/>Charles stared back without blinking.<br/>“One…<br/>Two…”<br/>They all prepared to shoot him down.<br/>Wilson opened his mouth to say “three—”<br/>A thunderous voice shook the entire lobby.<br/>“What the hell is happening here!”<br/>Everyone froze.<br/>Two men walked in through the glass doors. Their footsteps were slow but heavy enough to silence the entire building. <br/>They wore thick long jackets that swayed like armor. Their faces were rough, aged by power, and hardened by violence. Behind them marched almost sixty gunmen, moving in perfect formation.<br/>Wilson’s grin spread instantly.<br/>The first man with tinted hair stepped forward. Mr. Eden — the true owner of Titan Company.<br/>Beside him walked Mr. Jason — Norman’s father, and the owner of Real Consortium Estate, one of the biggest names in the entire city.<br/>Wilson laughed, relieved. “My father is here… you are finished.”<br/>Norman smirked. “And my father too. He’s been looking for you. He will torture you first before he kills you.”<br/>Both of them were notorious and they adored their sons, spoiled them, enabled them, and destroyed anyone who offended them. <br/>Wilson had already reported Charles to his father many times. Mr. Eden showing up meant only one thing. Charles was doomed.<br/>Wilson bowed, proud and loud. “Father, this is the man I told you about. The one who stole our stones. He even dared to come into our building. He is finished.”<br/>Norman pointed at Charles with shaking rage. “Father, that’s him. The man who has been causing me trouble. He even took the Mythier’s Stone. Don’t let him go. Make him pay.”<br/>Both powerful men stopped side by side and stared straight at Charles.<br/>Wilson and Norman stood tall, grinning. They kept their eyes on their fathers, expecting them to snap their fingers and order Charles to be shredded into pieces.<br/>Wilson whispered, “They arre going to break your legs first.”<br/>Norman smirked. “Then your arms. Then your face.”<br/>But something was wrong. Their fathers weren’t speaking. They weren’t angry. They weren’t even breathing normally.<br/>Both powerful men stared at Charles like they had seen a ghost wearing human skin.<br/>Then, at the same time…they lowered their heads. And bowed. Bow for Charles. <br/>“Please… forgive us,” Mr. Eden said.<br/>“Please forgive us,” Mr. Jason added right after.<br/>The entire lobby went silent.<br/>Wilson’s smile froze on his face.<br/>Norman’s mind cracked. He gasped and gulped at the same time. <br/>Both of them stumbled backward, eyes wide, mouths hanging open as if their souls just left their bodies.<br/>“What…” Wilson whispered.<br/>“What are you doing?” Norman stuttered. “Father… get up. Why are you bowing… to him?”</div>
