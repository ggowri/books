        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div>When Charles arrived at the house, he found that Tracy was already in her car. He walked up to her. She was beautifully dressed...even better than the night before.<br/>“I need to talk to you, it's a serious one,” he said, so he could tell her how this might be their last meeting.<br/>But she sighed and looked at him as if she were tired.<br/>“I am going somewhere urgent. Please, it can wait,” she said sharply. Whenever she mentioned something urgent, it was always about her business and meetings. Well, until yesterday. <br/>Just then, his eyes flicked to the back of the car and saw Derek and Francis in the back seat.<br/>He scoffed. Where was this “urgent” thing that she was going with Derek for?<br/>Almost as if reading his thoughts, Derek chimed in, “Mr. Charles, please don’t have any other thoughts. I am meeting some important clients, and Ms. Tracy offered to accompany me.”<br/>Charles just nodded his head.<br/>Derek faced Tracy. “Maybe I should go on my way. I don’t want your husband to have any other thoughts.”<br/>Tracy waved her arms dismissively. “He has nothing important to say. Derek, you said your meeting was important, don’t waste your time. Let’s go.”<br/>In the blink of an eye, she pressed the pedal and drove away.<br/>Charles stood there for a few minutes before realizing what had just happened. The “urgent” thing was accompanying Derek to his client meeting. In their five years of marriage, she had turned down every outing proposal he ever made, yet she was strict about following Derek to a meeting.<br/>Charles stood frozen, his body refusing to move, The realization hit him like a fist to the gut. He wasn’t her partner anymore. He was a shadow on the curb, watching her drive away, watching her choose someone else. <br/>The street was quiet, but inside his chest, something was shattering, echoing so loud it drowned out everything else.<br/>He was nothing but a joke to her. Standing in the middle of the compound, he looked at the house one more time. This would be the last time he saw it.<br/>He wanted to even shed tears but take it back. Every boundary of Tracy always ends with her. It doesn't matter with Derek and Francis. They were her life, he was pathetic and irrelevant.<br/>He spent the little money he had left on a small lodge room for the night.<br/>Charles waited for his friend John to pick him up, but instead he received a message:<br/>“The fire has died down a bit. You don’t need to go to the scene today. We’ll call you if there’s an emergency.”<br/>He settled down in the room. Just then, his phone chimed...it was a message from Tracy:<br/>“You mentioned you want to see me. Let’s meet tonight for dinner. I’ll send you the location.”<br/>He scoffed. She acted so strange...embracing Derek in the morning, insisting she had to go with him, and now she wanted to meet?<br/>Still, he decided to go along with it. This would be their first outing for dinner since their marriage.<br/>Looking back at that time, he wished he could reverse it. That period was one of the best in his life..the day she said yes. Now, it was all meaningless.<br/>That night, he arrived earlier to prepare. He made sure the meal was ordered exactly as she liked. Today, he was going to outline how horrible she had been, while keeping the mood regretful, like a farewell.<br/>He waited for two hours. Still no sign of her. He scoffed. “Why did I even think she would come in the first place? She always did whatever she wanted”, he murmured to himself. He was just about to leave when he saw her coming from the entrance.<br/>She had come after all. But then his face wrinkled. What the fuck! Derek and Francis were with her too.<br/>He had planned this as a farewell dinner…that he might die in the fire and end things. Yet these two tagged along. It was insane. This just made the meeting useless.<br/>They walked to him and immediately sat down, Tracy patting Francis.<br/>“Tracy, what are you doing? I called only you here tonight,” Charles said.<br/>Derek quickly replied, “Yeah, but I asked her if I could tag along. I want to apologize for all the misunderstandings I caused. And I think a dinner is perfect for it! Also, I’ll pay for everything we eat. So don’t panic.”<br/>Tracy chimed in, “That’s how generous and kind he is. You should learn how to behave from him. You can't pay for the food anyway.”<br/>Charles couldn’t help but scoff. He might die soon, and he wanted to tell her that this was supposed to be private and emotional..yet she ruined it. <br/>All the words he had prepared rushed back inside his stomach. Eating him from inside.<br/>Derek chimed in again, “Mr. Charles. Why are you gloomy? I told you I will pay, please don't worry, you can order anything. Cheers!”. He raised his glass up for toast. <br/>Derek couldn't move an inch, his heart was chattering.<br/>Tracy chimed in, “Uhm, why are you behaving like this. You can see Derek trying to mend things up. Don't be pathetic”. Then she faced Derek and clicked the glass.<br/>“Let us not let him spoil our night!” she giggled out loud, and they all downed their drinks. Then the three of them started talking...laughing, Francis sharing stories about his school and listing all the things he wanted to buy, with Tracy promising she would do anything for him.<br/>Like that, Charles was pushed aside. Like a stranger. He wanted to storm out, but remembering this might be his last moment, he decided to go along with it and tell them what he was here for.<br/> “I got a call from the emergency service today. They may need my services…” He told them about the dangers, about how many firefighters had already died.<br/>But all the while, they were just busy eating. Tracy was feeding Francis, and Derek was giggling as if it were funny. They didn’t even react. They didn’t even care. He might die, and Tracy showed no concern. <br/>“Do you even hear me?” he asked. Because she wouldn’t act like that if she truly heard him.<br/>“Yes, I heard you. Why should I care? I already told you to stop that work. Well, just stay safe,” she said simply.<br/>He felt like vomiting. She heard him and didn’t care if he died. He thought, ‘Hell, how did I even love through this for five years? Was I charmed?’<br/>Every time he thought Tracy would realize her mistakes or reflect on her behavior, she only got worse.<br/>This was supposed to be their farewell, but it was bland and hurtful to him. He decided to just leave.<br/>As he was about to stand up, Tracy’s eyes widened. She looked horrified like she could turn into a stone.<br/>“No! Charles, look out!”<br/>He looked up and saw a chandelier crashing down right where he was sitting. He knew if it landed on him, he would no doubt die. He had seconds to run away, and escaped the danger. but Tracy would also be seriously injured if it struck near her.<br/>Panicked, he immediately kicked the table in their direction. This made Tracy, Derek, and Francis fling away, far from where the chandelier would land. They would be safe.<br/>In that millisecond, he also shifted from where it would land… but he was too late.</div>
