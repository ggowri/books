        <h1>Chapter 134</h1>
        <div>Late in the night, in front of the police station, Tracy paced back and forth, arms folded, her heels clicking against the pavement. Her secretary Maya stood beside her, hugging a tablet close to her chest.<br/>Tracy groaned under her breath. “How the hell did he even end up in this situation… Why did he have to kill Mr. Eden?” She rubbed her forehead. “And he did all this because of me. I should at least go in and see him.”<br/>Maya stepped closer. “Ma, I won’t advise that. There are reporters all over the station. If they see you going inside, they will immediately connect it to you… and it will drag you down with him.”<br/>Tracy clenched her jaw. “Fuck… I should have known something was wrong when he brought that ten million dollars. I should have known.”<br/>Maya’s eyes widened. “Ma, please be careful what you say. Don’t talk like that out loud. You know nothing about this case and people could overhear. Let’s just leave. You don’t have to check on him. And also remember… the investor that’s currently helping us rebuild… he won’t like this at all. He might pull out.”<br/>Tracy froze.<br/>That hit her. Hard.<br/>Maya continued gently. “Ma… think about your future. Think about your company.”<br/>Tracy swallowed and nodded slowly. “Yeah… yeah you’re right. I should think about my future.” Not knowing that investor was Charles himself.<br/>She turned to leave, shoulders slumped, distracted and bumped straight into someone.<br/>Tracy stumbled backward and actually fell even though she was the one who collided.<br/>The person she bumped didn’t even stop or apologize.  She just kept walking.<br/>Annoyance shot through her. “Hey! You bitch! Don’t you see you hit me?!”<br/>The woman stopped and turned around sharply. She was startled to see that the person was Serena.<br/>Tracy muttered, “It’s… it’s you.”<br/>Serena stood with her arms crossed, eyes sharp. “Yes. You bumped into me and called me a bitch. You should fix your mouth”<br/>Tracy pushed herself up, annoyed. “You are the one who hit me. You should apologize. Instead you stood there acting like a saint.”<br/>Serena scoffed. “You are a horrible person. No wonder Charles left you.”<br/>Tracy stiffened. “Talking about Charles… are you here for him?”<br/>Serena didn’t hesitate. “Of course. What about you, have you seen him yet?”<br/>Tracy shook her head quickly. “No. And I’m not going. He dragged himself into this mess. I shouldn’t ruin my reputation because of him.”<br/>Serena raised a brow. “You didn’t even hear from him yet and you are already accusing him.”<br/>Tracy snapped back, “Didn’t you see the news? He obviously killed Mr. Eden.”<br/>Serena shrugged. “Anyway, that’s none of my business if you are not entering.”<br/>Tracy’s eyes narrowed. “You are going in? You don’t even think about your own future? Reporters are inside.”<br/>Serena looked at her like she was stupid. “I’m not throwing him under the bus without hearing his side of the story.”<br/>She walked past Tracy and entered the station without hesitation.<br/>Tracy stood frozen.<br/>Serena had far more to lose than her  and even knew Charles lesser than her— yet she still walked in.<br/>Maya sighed and touched Tracy’s arm. “Ma, don’t even think about it. Serena is stupid for doing that. She will face the consequences soon. Don’t be like her.”<br/>Tracy exhaled shakily. “Yeah… you are right.”<br/>She turned around and left.<br/>---<br/>Inside the police station<br/>Serena stepped through the doors and almost bumped into a wall of microphones.<br/>Reporters were indeed everywhere. They stormed at her as they saw her.<br/>“Ms. Serena, are you here to see your murderer fiancé?”<br/>“Why would you show up after what he did?”<br/>“Are you planning to break up with him publicly?”<br/>Serena’s face tightened but she didn’t back away.<br/>“You all should stop jumping to conclusions,” she said steadily. “I heard he isn’t even admitting to the crime. That means there is more to the story, so stop throwing accusations around.”<br/>One reporter pushed forward. “So you’re saying you stand by him?”<br/>Serena lifted her chin. “As long as he says he didn’t do it… yes.”<br/>The reporters burst into murmurs.<br/>“She’s crazy.”<br/>“She’s ruining her image.”<br/>“She’s done for.”<br/>Serena ignored all of them and marched deeper into the station.<br/>Inside the cell area, Charles sat behind the bars with Lizzypie beside him, arms folded, eyes sharp.<br/>She had surprised him earlier when she flashed her ID and said she was a licensed lawyer. She would be representing him.<br/>Natasha was also there, pacing with her arms crossed.<br/>Serena stepped in and froze.<br/>She saw Charles… and the two women beside him.<br/>“So even in a situation like this…” she muttered. “His women still don’t leave him.”<br/>She coughed loudly to announce her presence.<br/>Lizzypie glanced up. “Oh. Serena. You came.”<br/>Charles smiled softly when he saw her.<br/>Serena frowned immediately. “You’re smiling. Huh.”<br/>She forced herself to look away from his face and instead greeted Lizzypie and Natasha.<br/>Then she faced Charles again.<br/>“Did you kill him? Please tell me the truth. Is it self-defense? Did Mr. Eden attack you? Did he try something? Just tell me. I won’t judge. If he hurt you first, I will understand. I will call ten high-profile lawyers to defend you.”<br/>Charles blinked, surprised at her panic.<br/>Even though their relationship was fake, she looked genuinely worried.<br/>Lizzypie noticed and smirked faintly.<br/>Charles exhaled. “Thank you… but I didn’t kill him.”<br/>Serena stiffened. “Then what happened?”<br/>Charles told them everything.<br/>The messages, and how the police badged in at the exact time.<br/>Serena’s eyes widened. “So someone framed you.  But who could it be…”<br/>Natasha suddenly stopped pacing. “You all need to see this.”<br/>She pulled out her phone and pressed play on a live video.<br/>It was the news.<br/>A reporter stood in front of Titan Company.<br/>And next to her… was Wilson, Mr. Eden’s son.<br/>He was crying dramatically on camera, tears streaming, clutching his chest.<br/>“That bastard Charles! Or whatever his name is! He killed my father!” Wilson announced loudly. “I can testify! He has been bullying our company for months. He beat our security. He stole our stones. Even yesterday he beat me and my father and forced ten million dollars from us. Money my father was keeping for company expansion!”<br/>Wilson continued, still crying.<br/>“A few minutes before he died, my father called me, begging for help, saying Charles was stalking him. I told him to call the police immediately. That monster killed my father. I can prove it. The law must punish him!”</div>
