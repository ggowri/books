        <h1>Chapter 170</h1>
        <div>Charles lowered the camera slowly.<br/>Lizzypie whispered, “What’s going on?” She tugged his sleeve. “Give me the camera.”<br/>He passed it to her without a word.<br/>She pressed it to her eye. Her face changed almost instantly.<br/>“What the hell…” she murmured.<br/>Inside the container the girls were packed tight. Some were barely clothed. Others had torn dresses hanging off them. Their skin looked dull. With their ribs showing vividly. They looked weak and starved.<br/>The men started dragging them out roughly.<br/>One by one they were shoved to the ground, yelled at, kicked forward into a rough line. The men barked orders and even molesting them. <br/>Lizzypie’s grip on the camera tightened. Then she stiffened.<br/>“That’s her,” she said quietly. “That’s Vera.”<br/>Charles leaned in and looked again.He saw her. Shaking like others. <br/>He nodded with annoyance. “Yeah. That’s her.”   His stomach burned.<br/>“What are they doing?” Lizzypie asked, though she already knew.<br/>Before Charles could answer, headlights cut through the darkness.<br/>Cars started arriving one after another. They were lining up.  All of them were luxury cars. <br/>The doors opened. Big men stepped out. All in black suits. Each one flanked by bodyguards.  There were so many. <br/>The men from the van started gesturing. Pointing at the girls. <br/>Charles stated,  “They are selling them.”<br/>Lizzypie swallowed hard. “Human trafficking.”<br/>“Yes,” Charles said. His eyes stayed on the scene. <br/>She looked at them with pity.  “Some of them are kids, they are underage, how could they be so wicked.”<br/>In the scene was Jasmine, who was heading the deal. They were selling the girls, as they always did. <br/>He faced one of the wealthy sellers and handed Vera to one of them, “Look at this one. She is like 16, and already growing boobs, she is also intelligent,  which means your kids are going to be intelligent also. She is fertile and will give you a lot of kids”.<br/>Vera was fighting hard, “Leave me alone… I don't want to go with this man!”.<br/>Smack. <br/>Jasmine gave him a hot slap, “hey bitch,  you should be grateful we are selling you to him. At least, he wants to make you his wife, not a slave”.<br/>Vera was just crying as The two started bagging and closed the deal for 2 million dollars.<br/>So were others. <br/>Just then, a voice came from behind.<br/>“Wow, quite a business going on here”.<br/>Everyone stopped in their tracks and turned to the voice. What first appeared was his silhouette before Charles came to light.<br/>Instantly,  each of the bodyguards brought out guns and pointed it at him. <br/>One of the wealthy men stepped forward, furious.<br/>“Who the hell is this man? What is he doing here?”<br/>Murmurs spread through the crowd. <br/>Charles took another step into the light. His voice carried.<br/>“Well. I’m here to put a stop to this nonsense.”<br/>Jasmine walked forward slowly,<br/>“You are really stubborn. And you are asking for death. How dare you come here and disrupt Mr. Damien’s business.”<br/>Charles scoffed.<br/>“Business?” He shook his head. “You’re trafficking girls to people who don’t even deserve to be called human. You sell them to be sexually exploited.”<br/>Jasmine folded his arms.<br/>“And how is that your business?”<br/>“This is Winchester,” he continued. “Mr. Damien owns it.”<br/>Charles stepped closer. His jaw tightened.<br/>“And that justifies selling innocent girls?”<br/>“These girls didn’t even have a life to begin with. Most of them are orphans. No protection. No future. And we sell them to fix the city”. Jasmine laughed and added softly.<br/>“We are taking preventive measures. They would only grow up to threaten the peace of this city.”<br/>Charles snapped.<br/>“Let the girls go. Now.”<br/>One of the men barked,<br/>“What the hell is he talking about? Who is this guy?”<br/>Jasmine tilted her head.<br/>“Who do you think you are? Batman?” She spread her arms. “Look around you. There are over fifty gunmen here. Only you. We will tear you apart and the wind will scatter what’s left.”<br/>Charles didn’t move.<br/>“I said let the girls go. Now.”<br/>Jasmine turned to the buyers and guards.<br/>“I don’t know who he is. But he has been sabotaging Mr. Damien for a while. Do whatever you want with him.”<br/>The guards raised their guns. Fingers tightened on triggers and were all ready to shot him down right in the scene.<br/>Just Then….<br/>Tk tk tk tk tk.<br/>The sky roared.<br/>Searchlights sliced through the darkness. <br/>Five helicopters hovered overhead. They were big and formed a circle. <br/>Each side door opened as mounted machine guns swung down and locked onto the crowd.<br/>Red dots appeared everywhere. On their chests, heads and guns.<br/>A voice boomed from above. With a very commanding tone. <br/>“All units on the ground. You are surrounded. Drop your weapons immediately. I won’t say it twice. This is your only warning.”<br/>Everyone murmured to each other as they raised their heads up. <br/>Jasmine slowly looked up, his face draining of color.<br/>The men started to tremble.<br/>One of them shouted up at the helicopters, his voice shaking.<br/>“Hey. Who are you people? Do you know what you are doing? Do you have any idea who we are”<br/>Another stepped forward, trying to sound important.<br/>“I am the Minister of Internal Affairs. No one has the right to fly combat helicopters without clearance. I order you to leave now. This is Mr. Damien’s Dome. You don’t want to anger him, so leave now”<br/>For a moment the rotors were the only sound.<br/>Then the voice came again. Louder and sharper..<br/>“I am not listening to any of your nonsense. Everyone on the ground will go on their knees and surrender. Now.”<br/>Panic rippled through the crowd.<br/>Jasmine’s face tightened. He leaned toward Charles and hissed,<br/>“Who are these people? No military has ever gone against Mr. Damien in Winchester.”<br/>Charles smiled. It was thin and cold.<br/>“Actually,” he said, “they are not military. They are thugs.”<br/>Jasmine frowned before he scoffed,  “So, you sent some ordinary thugs, to cause commotion here. Do you know you can be labelled as a national terrorist!”.<br/>Charles smirked and said, “You are speaking too much… I need to send my message well”, Then he pressed his earbud and said.<br/>“This man in front of me…. Kill him”.<br/>Jasmine was confused and said, “Uhn… what…”.<br/>Boom!<br/>A hole was made in the Jasmine head as his blood and brain scattered out. He slowly dropped dead. </div>
