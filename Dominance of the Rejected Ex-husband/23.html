        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div>"What are you doing here, you loser?" Mrs. Hailey snapped, hurrying over to him. As she grabbed his hand. <br/>Mrs. Hailey, though in her forties, still looked surprisingly young. She always kept her hair pulled back, her posture straight, her style refined. To a stranger, she might easily have been mistaken for Tracy’s sister, when in fact she was her mother.<br/>The Quill family, from which Mrs. Hailey came, had only ever been middle class, yet they carried themselves with the delusion that they belonged among the wealthy elite.<br/>The marriage between Charles and Tracy had hardly been known outside the Quill family. They had despised him because he was poor.<br/>And now, after Tracy had finally thrown Charles out, Mrs. Hailey was delighted. Seeing him here again, she was certain he had come only to stir trouble and ruin her daughter’s reputation.<br/>Charles bowed slightly, still showing respect. “Mother.”<br/>“Shut up! Do not ever greet me again,” she snapped. “After everything our daughter did for you, she even went against her father and grandfather to marry you, only for you to accuse her of cheating. She gave you a home, and you still walked out just because she asked you to adopt a child!” Her voice rose to a shriek.<br/>Charles scoffed. Tracy had been running around painting herself as the victim, twisting the truth to make it seem as though everything was his fault.<br/>“Ma… is that what Tracy told you? She lied. She—” he began.<br/>She seized his arm sharply, cutting him off. “Shut up. I do not want to hear another word. Get the hell out of here right now! This is not a place for someone like you.”<br/>Charles’s face darkened.<br/>During his five years of marriage into the Quill family, Mrs. Hailey had never once treated him with respect. To her, he was nothing more than a stain on their name.<br/>In the past, he might have swallowed his pride and endured her contempt in silence. But not anymore.<br/>With a cold snort, he wrenched his arm free so forcefully that she nearly lost her balance.<br/>“If you cannot hear what I have to say, then leave me alone!” Charles said harshly.<br/>Mrs. Hailey’s anger burned, but with people watching, she forced herself to maintain her composure.<br/>At that moment, she spotted Derek and rushed toward him as though she had found salvation.<br/>Derek’s gaze fixed on Charles, who stood tall and unyielding, defiance radiating from his posture.<br/>The memory of last night at the Royal Hotel was still vivid in Derek’s mind. Charles had been escorted directly to the fortieth floor, the highest seat of power in the entire city, and he had even been treated as an honored guest.<br/>Derek had exhausted every connection he had, yet still could not uncover who Charles had met. He began to suspect that maybe Charles had simply stumbled across someone wealthy and was trying to take advantage.<br/>But looking at Charles now, Derek sneered. Charles wore the same shabby clothes from the night before. He looked terrible.<br/>“What are you even doing here?” Derek spat. “Look at yourself. A rag doll. A worthless man!”<br/>Derek stepped forward, his voice dripping with scorn. His two-faced cruelty shocked Charles… This same Derek had always acted kind and courteous in front of Tracy.<br/>Mrs. Hailey immediately turned to Derek. “Derek… Charles is here to spoil my daughter’s reputation. He wants to slander you and Tracy. You have to kick him out right now!”<br/>Hearing this, Derek faced Charles. “Tell me. What are you here for? If you are here for the birthday, then you must have your invitation card. Where is your card?”<br/>“None of your concern,” Charles sneered.<br/>Hearing this, Derek immediately concluded that Charles was only here to make a fool of himself.<br/>“Look at you. Just yesterday, you were mistaken for an important person, you were acting all high and mighty, when in truth you just went there for a job interview! As if the Royal Hotel would ever hire someone like you. I am sure they kicked you out, and now you are here again to lick someone’s boots.” Derek sneered viciously.<br/>Charles only smiled. If Vincent had already given him his power, he would have humiliated Derek right then. But that time was coming soon. For now, he only stared in silence.<br/>Mrs. Hailey snapped, “Derek, enough of this. Just throw him out already!”<br/>Charles frowned. “Who do you think you are? This is the Moretti family’s estate, not the Quill family’s. You have no authority whatsoever to send me out.”<br/>The special guests from the city’s most esteemed families were beginning to take notice of the commotion.<br/>Then Derek moved closer to Charles and sneered at him. His voice was low so others couldn't hear him. <br/>“Do you know why I am here? To sign a multimillion-dollar deal with the Moretti family. I surprised them, and they want a partnership with me. All thanks to Tracy! I am the center of attention today, because I will soon be one of the partners they announce.”<br/>Charles now understood Derek’s arrogance. This deal could truly make him wealthy. It explained why he clung to Tracy… Her company was influential, and many investors valued her. Clearly, Derek was using her as a stepping stone, hiding behind the emotions of being her so-called first love.<br/>But none of it concerned Charles.<br/>He said calmly, “I am not here for you.” Then he turned to the bodyguards. “Please call me Mr. Fred.”<br/>Derek stepped forward, panic flickering behind his anger. “If you kick this bastard out, I will give each of you fifty thousand dollars!” he barked at the bodyguards.<br/>In truth, Derek was terrified that Charles had come to expose Tracy’s affair with him. If that came to light here, the situation would turn disastrous. Charles had to be removed quickly.<br/>Before Charles realized it, the bodyguards had surrounded him, tempted by the money.</div>
