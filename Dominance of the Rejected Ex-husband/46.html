        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div><p>Tiger glanced at his buttons. Like him, they had all been badly beaten by Charles. He felt humiliated and extremely angry at the same time, but he also realized that perhaps none of them were a match for Charles.</p><p>He waved his hand irritably and suddenly showed a cruel smile. He vowed to torture Charles in the most brutal way.</p><p>&quot;Call Noxon and Scorpion. They should teach this guy a lesson and then castrate him,&quot; he roared at his subordinates and then turned to Charles.&quot;And just so you know… I&#x27;m going to enjoy every second of making your precious little lover scream right in front of you.</p><p>Nearby, Tracy wept helplessly.</p><p>Meanwhile, Outside the compound, the sharp crack of gunshots sent Mrs. Hailey into a panic. She clutched Derek’s arm, her voice trembling. &quot;Please, you have to do something! My daughter is in there—we can&#x27;t just stand here while she’s in danger!&quot;</p><p>Derek shoved her off with a scowl. &quot;Don&#x27;t be hysterical.&quot;</p><p>At that moment, a beautiful voice cut through the tension. “Where is Charles!”</p><p>They turned and saw Serena walking toward them, with Fred behind her. Serena had pretended to be monitoring Charles because she wanted to know more about him, and maybe she could trust him. Fred had informed her moments ago about the situation, which was why she was here.</p><p>Derek’s eyes widened at the sight of her. He quickly straightened up, puffing out his chest in a pathetic attempt to look impressive. &quot;Ms. Serena! What brings you out on such a… chilly evening? It’s not safe for someone like you.&quot;</p><p>Serena ignored his fake concern. &quot;Where is Charles?&quot; she repeated, her tone clipped. She didn’t owe him an explanation, but the thought of Charles walking into a trap alone unsettled her more than she cared to admit.</p><p>Mrs. Hailey then chimed in, &quot;He’s inside! He caused all of this, and now my daughter might be—&quot;</p><p>Serena looked her up and down and hissed, “Help your daughter, when your daughter’s lover is here outside while his girlfriend might be dying inside? A standing coward!”</p><p>Derek felt insulted but immediately responded,  &quot;First of all, Tracy and I are not involved like that. And second, charging in there isn’t bravery—it’s stupidity. Tiger’s men are animals. Rushing in would only make things worse. I’m using my head—something a real gentleman would do.&quot;</p><p>Serena let out a short, cold laugh. &quot;A real gentleman? The only real man here is the one who actually went inside to save someone. You’re just a coward hiding behind excuses.&quot;</p><p>Derek’s jaw tightened. He couldn’t stand how she defended Charles. </p><p>His face turned a sickly yellow color, but he acted as if he were expressing some kind of truth. &quot;Ms. Serena, open your eyes. If he’s so committed to you, why is he still risking his life for his ex-wife? He’s playing you. He doesn’t respect your engagement—he’s still hung up on her.&quot;</p><p>Serena looked at him in disgust before snapping back, “Shut up. He is doing it because his ex-wife was here due to him, because he believed he was the cause. If you dare to doubt him again, I will cut off your tongue.” </p><p>She looked vicious and determined. Derek immediately kept his mouth shut. He was fuming.</p><p>Serena turned back toward the building, arms crossed tightly. &quot;Fred, what are our options?&quot;</p><p>Fred shook his head grimly. &quot;Ma’am, the Tiger Fang Gang doesn’t negotiate. We’re not equipped to storm the place. There’s nothing we can do.&quot;</p><p>Just as despair began to set in, a smooth voice interrupted from the shadows.</p><p>“Actually, there is only one person the Tiger Fang will likely listen to. In fact, they will bow for Charles if they hear the name.”</p><p>They turned toward the voice, and there stood a sexy womanly figure. Both Derek and Serena immediately recognized her from the banquet. She was the one who had brought the portrait.</p><p>Derek flushed red as he saw her. She looked damn sexy, even more so than a moment before—she looked like she had been just well fucked by a man. Just thinking about this made Derek feel his penis become so hard that it hurt.</p><p>Serena’s gaze narrowed. &quot;Who are you? And how do you know Charles?&quot;</p><p>LizzyPie smiled lazily. &quot;Let’s just say I’m a very… close friend.&quot;</p><p>Serena felt an unexpected pang of jealousy, though she didn’t even know why. Just a friend? She highly doubted it.</p><p>Derek thought, “Fuck. Is Charles fuck bagged this girl?”</p><p>Derek couldn’t help himself. &quot;See, Ms. Serena? Your fiancé has a &#x27;close friend&#x27; who looks like that, and he’s still hung up on his ex. Are you really going to let him play you like this?&quot;</p><p>Serena snapped at him coldly, her voice sharp like a blade. “Shut your filthy mouth, Derek. You disgust me. You keep talking trash because you are nothing compared to him. You are not even half the man Charles is, I am sure you are just jealous and in pain.” Her words hit him hard, and she didn’t stop there. “Whether he has a best friend or an ex-wife doesn’t matter to me. What matters is that my fiancé is in danger.”</p><p>Derek’s face twisted in anger, but he dared not reply.</p><p>Serena then turned to LizzyPie, ignoring him completely. “You said there is someone who can help. How?”</p><p>LizzyPie popped her gum and chewed with a sly smile. “The Godfather.”</p><p></p></div>
