        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div><p>The divorce between Charles and Tracy was already final, but Tracy always found a way to jump back into Charles’s life, even when it did not concern her. </p><p>Charles sighed as he stood there while Tracy and Derek approached. His eyes were on Derek, who wore that innocent look he always did whenever he was with Tracy. </p><p>“I heard you luckily managed to win 100 million yesterday, and now you are here to bid. You are really trying so hard to stay relevant. This is what you always wanted,” Tracy shoved at him.</p><p>“Why can’t you just shut up and mind your business? Must you talk?” Charles snapped.</p><p>Tracy sneered. “I understand that you hate the truth, but let me tell you, that 100 million is nothing in the real world. It will vanish so fast, especially for you, you womanizer.” She cast a look at Lizzypie and added, “And you are proud. 100 million is nothing at this kind of auction. You will be embarrassed!.”</p><p>Lizzypie was holding back before, but she could not anymore. She hated how Tracy always tried to shame Charles. </p><p>She stepped forward and said, “Talking of 100 million, I’m sure you and your hypocritic, useless lover do not have that amount in hand. So stop being jealous and move out of the way.”</p><p>“I don’t know who the hell you are, lady, but you better mind your business. I can tell you are nothing more than a whore and a fling. He divorced me, and in a week got engaged to Ms. Serena, and already he is on you without being ashamed. You are nothing more than a prostitute; you better be the one to shut up,” Tracy erupted.</p><p>Smack.</p><p>Lizzypie did not hesitate. She delivered a hard slap and Tracy flung away. Derek, seeing this, tried to intervene and slap Lizzypie back, but Charles held his hand up as if nothing had happened. Derek, who recalled how Charles nearly broke his wrist in the past, froze in shock.</p><p>“Please… let me go. Let me go,” he cried before Charles shoved him aside. Derek nearly fell. Tracy was furious and wanted to attack again, but Charles stood between them.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Charles said.</p><p>Tracy stared at Charles in disbelief. “What? She slapped me, Charles. You stood there when she slapped me, and now that I want to hit her back you are saying it is okay? Charles, I hate you. I always knew what kind of person you are!”</p><p>Charles sighed. “You abused her first. You called her a prostitute and a whore.”</p><p>“So that justifies her slapping me? You will not even let me do mine back. You are horrible, Charles. I should never have married you. All you care about is your mouth and your dick. She is feeding you and sleeping with you, that&#x27;s the reason you are taking her side. You will face your karma.” Tracy burst into tears, playing the victim.</p><p>People nearby started chiming in. “That man is horrible, isn’t he Ms. Serena’s fiancé? He slapped his ex-wife because of another lady.” </p><p>“He is horrible.”</p><p> “I hope Ms. Serena sees this.”</p><p>Derek leaned in to console Tracy. “It’s okay, it’s okay. I think he is acting like this because of the 100 million he just got. You will get your justice.”</p><p>Charles could only sigh. He was about to leave the commotion behind when another voice roared. “Who the heck dares cause a commotion in the National Hall?”</p><p>Charles already knew who it was before he looked. Everyone stepped aside as Norman advanced, flanked by four guards. Charles stood and met him as Norman came closer.</p><p>Derek immediately ranted, “Mr. Norman, the whore this useless man brought here slapped Tracy, and he still guided the lady, claiming she had the right to slap her.”</p><p>Norman, still fuming from yesterday’s event, faced Charles. “Is that so? Do you and your woman really do that?”</p><p>Charles stepped forward. “First, she is not a whore. Don&#x27;t you dare call her that? Also, who are you that I have to report to?”</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>Norman scoffed. “You think the 100 million and the 20 million you took from me make you something? It is an absolute change to what we, the Jeff  family and our legacy have. Let me tell you, this auction was sponsored by my father, Mr. Jeff. You and your woman should apologize to Tracy deeply, or else I will have you thrown out.”</p><p>Lizzypie stepped forward. “Maybe you should tell that woman to apologize for calling me a prostitute and a whore.”</p><p>Norman chuckled. “Hey, you better shut up. You have absolutely no right to talk here. This is not a choice. Apologize right away, or else they will not only have you thrown out, I will have you beaten.”</p><p>Norman’s threats did not faze them. They ignored him and began to turn away.</p><p>“Guard!” he roared, and the nearby special intelligence guards, all working for the government, rushed toward them. Norman pointed at Lizzypie and Charles. “These two are disturbing the peace. Throw them out right now.”</p><p>Lizzypie gulped. This was starting to get out of hand now that special intelligence was involved.</p><p> She tried to explain, “She is the one who started it. She called me a whore, and I gave her a slap she deserved.”</p><p>Norman shrieked, “Aren’t you a whore? Who do you think you are to slap people anyhow? These security guards will not listen to you except me. So save your spit. Either you go on your knees and apologize now, or I will have you thrown out.”</p><p>Seeing no response, Norman commanded, “Beat the shit out of them right now.”</p><p>Charles rolled his fist and readied himself to take them on.</p></div>
