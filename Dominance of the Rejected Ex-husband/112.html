        <h1>chapter 112</h1>
        <div><p>Serena scoffed when she saw the caller ID.</p><p>“Yeah… it’s surely not about her,” she said with bitter sarcasm.</p><p>Charles sighed heavily. </p><p>“You don’t need to explain,” she snapped. “Pick it up.”</p><p>Charles hesitated, caught in an awkward situation. He wanted to reject the call, but it was already late at night.</p><p>Why would Tracy call him at this hour?</p><p>He finally answered.</p><p>A woman’s voice came through urgently:</p><p>“Sir, please come pick up your wife at the Uplift Bar. She’s drunk and causing a scene here. I had to call you.”</p><p>Charles blinked.</p><p>“Wife?”</p><p>He frowned. “I’m not her husband. Please call someone else to pick her up.”</p><p>The woman on the phone sounded confused.</p><p>“Uh… but she saved your number as <em>My Husband</em>. And she kept calling your name. <em>Charles… Charles… </em>over and over. I understand you two must have misunderstandings. She’s really in bad shape, please. Be considerate. Come get her.”</p><p>Charles rubbed his forehead. Why would Tracy save his number like that? Why was she calling for him? But it was clear she needed help.</p><p>He exhaled. “…Fine. I’m coming.”</p><p>He hung up and turned to Serena to explain, but she cut him off sharply.</p><p>“It’s okay,” she said, her tone cold. “Go meet her.”</p><p>“Serena—”</p><p>“You don’t have to explain anything,” she snapped again. “You and I are in a fake relationship anyway. We will split up soon. And about earlier…” she looked away, eyes tight with hurt, “...don’t think about it again. I only offered myself because I was grateful you saved my life tonight. But clearly, you don’t want it. So… goodbye.”</p><p>Her words were like sharp needles.</p><p>Charles stood there, he felt like explaining, but Serena would never understand.</p><p>Serena turned her back as she went to sleep. </p><p>Charles bid her farewell. “…Goodnight.”</p><p>He walked out slowly </p><p>When he reached the hallway, he muttered under his breath:</p><p>“Damn… I should’ve just taken the chance. I shouldn’t have overthought this level thing. Now I have messed things up with Serena… and I might never even get the opportunity to sleep with her again”</p><p>He sighed, dragging a hand through his hair as he headed out.</p><p>---</p><p>Charles arrived at the bar and immediately saw a small crowd gathered near the entrance, whispering and pointing as Tracy stumbled around in the middle of them.</p><p> She was so drunk. Her famous legs were always covered in black stockings. Now they were bare. They shook in her high heels. Her face was pale and sweaty, with that blotchy drunk-red flush across her cheeks. Her hair was a mess. Loose strands stuck to her sweaty skin. Her shirt was half-open. Everyone could see down it.</p><p>She usually acted so proper. Now she was broken and drunk. The lowlifes loved it. They circled her like wolves.</p><p>They were staring at her tits and ass like hungry dogs, licking their lips while she tried to stand.</p><p>&quot;Get the fuck away from me!&quot; she screamed, taking a clumsy swing at a man who just laughed. &quot;Mind your own... your own business!&quot;</p><p>Some people snickered, shaking their heads.</p><p>“After what happened today? I’m not surprised she is doing something like this.”</p><p>“Oh, that lady that her mom and boyfriend were trending for fuckinh themselves”.</p><p>Charles pushed through the crowd quickly. The moment Tracy saw him, her expression changed completely; her voice cracked and she pointed at him while swaying like she would fall any second.</p><p>“My husband is here,” she said loudly, her words stumbling. “The love of my life… the one who betrayed me… left me alone while he got three ladies around him… and I got nothing… nothing except a man who betrayed me, fucking my own mother.”</p><p>Her voice broke painfully at the end, tears spilling down her cheeks as she laughed and cried at the same time in that messy, drunken way.</p><p>Charles tried to grab her shoulders gently. “Hey Tracy, what the fuck are you doing, I don&#x27;t have time for all this!”.</p><p>She stared at him but couldn’t even process his voice. Charles realized she was far too drunk to even stand, so he sighed deeply, slipped his arm under hers, lifted her with one arm around her back, and carried her out of the bar while people whispered behind him.</p><p>“Is he really helping her? Isn&#x27;t that his ex-husband&quot;.</p><p>“What!. That Ms. Serena’s fiancée right,  what an unfaithful fellow!”.</p><p>He ignored them all. </p><p>____</p><p>Charles arrived at Tracy’s home, and  carried her inside through the quiet hallway. He took her bedroom, placed her gently on the bed, and pulled a blanket over her.</p><p>He stood up, ready to leave quietly.</p><p>But just as he took a step toward the door, he heard her broken voice.</p><p>“Charles…”</p><p>He paused and turned slightly.</p><p>Tracy reached out blindly, her fingers catching his wrist.</p><p>“Please… don’t go,” she whispered, her voice shaking heavily.</p><p>Then the sobs came — deep, painful, uncontrollable sobs that made her whole body shake as tears streamed down her face.</p><p> She covered her eyes with her hands, crying harder as if everything she had been holding in all night finally collapsed.</p><p>“Please… just stay,” she whispered again, barely able to breathe through the crying.</p></div>
