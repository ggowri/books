        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div>Serena and Charles entered the hall, where everyone was laughing and chatting in circles of wealth and arrogance. Each space had its own cluster of people, and the sound of their voices filled the air.<br/>The moment they walked in, all eyes turned toward them. Everyone was surprised to see Serena finally engaged and jealous of Charles.<br/>At that moment, Mr. Vasilios arrived. Behind him was his daughter Janet, and her husband-to-be Mike. Today's celebrant.<br/>The hall erupted in applause. Instantly, people began showering them with gifts. The truth was, everyone wanted to gain Mr. Vasilios’s favor, and they would do anything for it.<br/>Derek was the first to step forward, eager to grab the center of attention.<br/>“Ms. Janet,” he said with a bow. “This may seem little, but please accept this shoe. It was made from the finest material, crafted by your favorite designer,  Finna. It’s the only one of its kind in the city and it's worth two million dollars!”<br/>The crowd gasped. The jeweled heel glistened under the chandeliers. In fact, compared to Derek’s gift, every other gift they had prepared suddenly felt worthless and Derek’s own swallowed them whole ten times over.<br/>“Wow, Mr. Derek,” Janet said, her face lighting up. “I am so grateful! To be the first person to wear this exclusive shoe is a dream. This is from my favorite designer!”<br/>Mr. Vasilios smiled proudly. After that, more people stepped forward with their gifts.<br/>“A vase worth two hundred thousand dollars.”<br/>“Two hundred and fifty thousand worth of jewelry.”<br/>Even an eight-hundred-thousand-dollar dress appeared, but none of it surpassed Derek’s dazzling gift.<br/>So much so that Mr. Vasilios said aloud, “I am so grateful for everyone’s gracious gifts, but I am especially moved by Mr. Derek. Out of all of you, his gift is unique, expensive, and has brought joy to my daughter. I must do something for you in return.”<br/>Derek smiled in satisfaction. Tracy, seeing this, quickly took his hand to share in his moment of triumph.<br/>“Yes,” she added sweetly. “We spent a lot of time researching Ms. Janet’s tastes to find the perfect gift.”<br/>At once, people assumed she was Derek’s lover and began praising her as well. Tracy only hoped this would help her gain a collaboration with Mr. Vasilios.<br/>Then Derek, seizing the moment, said, “While we’re at it… we all know the wealth and status of the Moretti family, and the close relationship between Ms. Serena and Mr. Vasilios. But we haven’t seen any gift from them.”<br/>The crowd murmured.<br/>“Yes, that’s true.”<br/> “She really should have come with something.”<br/>The truth was, Serena hadn’t prepared a gift. She hadn’t even thought of it.  To her, this was an engagement party meant to celebrate two people’s union, not a contest of wealth. But that was all anyone here cared about.<br/>Serena said nothing.<br/>Mr. Vasilios turned toward her. “Oh yes, that’s true. Serena, what has the Moretti family prepared for my daughter? I’m eager to see it.”<br/>Serena’s eyes hardened. Yesterday had been her birthday, and Mr. Vasilios hadn’t even sent her a gift or offered congratulations. He only came because her father had pleaded. And now, here he was, expecting her to bring gifts.<br/>She scoffed and said bluntly, “I didn’t bring any gift.”<br/>The hall froze.<br/>“What!”.<br/> “Really? No gift from the Moretti family?”.<br/> “That’s an insult to Mr. Vasilios! They don’t see him as worthy.”<br/>Whispers spread like fire. Mr. Vasilios’s face darkened with anger.<br/>Derek smiled slyly,  his plan had worked. He stepped in with mock sympathy.<br/>“I don’t think we should blame the Moretti family, nor Ms. Serena… After all, Serena is their representative. They would naturally assume she would bring a gift. But she also has a fiancé now.”<br/>He turned deliberately and looked straight at Charles.<br/>“She must have thought her fiancé would provide the gift. You know, it’s a man’s duty. Every gift presented here tonight came from men, didn’t it?”<br/>The crowd nodded in agreement.<br/>“Which means…” Derek declared with a smirk, “…Serena’s fiancé should be the one responsible for their gift!”.<br/>After Derek’s words, all eyes turned directly to Charles. Derek had successfully thrown him into the fire, making him the center of everyone’s judgment.<br/>People who had been curious about Charles, wondering if he came from a wealthy background,  began whispering among themselves.<br/>“Yeah, yeah… he’s right. The man is supposed to handle it, just like everyone else here tonight.”<br/>“He’s Serena Moretti’s fiancé, after all… the goddess’s man. He must be rich.”<br/>“I’m sure his gift will surpass everyone’s here”.<br/>Meanwhile, Charles stood still, his expression unreadable. Serena could see exactly what Derek was playing at. She quickly stepped forward.<br/>“I—” she began, her voice sharp.<br/>But Fred caught her arm and whispered urgently, “Ma’am, we should leave the situation as it is. Let him take the blame. We can’t risk offending Mr. Vasilios at this moment.”<br/>Serena’s eyes flared with anger, but Fred’s grip tightened, forcing her silence.<br/>Now, the hall grew quiet again. All eyes fixed on Charles.<br/>Charles sighed and started, “uhm… right now I have no gift with me”.<br/>What!.<br/>Derek scoffed,  “Really?. You don't have any gift with you?  Is that how you see Mr. Vasilios?. Or are you just that poor to afford getting any tangible gift?”.<br/>Charles was about to talk but Derek cut him off again.<br/>“Before we even say anything. Can you tell us who you are, what you do, and do you even deserve to be at this party, that is only meant for rich, well respected powerful people, are you one of our calibre?!”. He challenged him.</div>
