        <h1>Chapter 159</h1>
        <div>Charles's eyes darkened with heat. He stepped forward, closing the gap. His hands grabbed Natasha's waist, pulling her hard against him. She gasped, feeling his growing bulge press into her thigh.<br/>"You want me to fuck you?" he growled low.<br/>"Yes," she whispered, breathing hot on his neck. "Fuck me, boss."<br/>He didn't wait. His mouth crashed onto hers, tongue pushing in deep. She moaned, kissing back hungrily, hands sliding under his shirt to feel his hard chest.<br/>Charles yanked her off-shoulder top down. Her full breasts spilled out, nipples already stiff. He groaned, cupping one roughly, thumb rubbing the hard peak. Natasha arched, pushing her chest into his palm.<br/>"Fuck, your tits are perfect," he muttered.<br/>He bent down, sucking one nipple into his mouth. Tongue swirled hard, teeth grazing lightly. She whimpered, fingers tangling in his hair, pulling him closer.<br/>His free hand hiked up her short skirt. No panties. Her pussy was already wet, smooth and bare. He slid two fingers along her slick folds, finding her clit.<br/>"So fucking wet, and slicky," he said, circling it fast.<br/>Natasha bucked against his hand. "Please... more and faster."<br/>He pushed her back against the glass counter. Stones rattled inside. She hopped up, legs spreading wide. Skirt rolled up to her waist, pussy exposed and spread. <br/>Charles unzipped fast. His thick dick sprang out, hard and veined, tip already leaking. Natasha stared, licking her lips.<br/>"...," she breathed.<br/>He grabbed her thighs, pulling her to the edge. Rubbed his cockhead up and down her wet slit, teasing her entrance.<br/>"Now," she begged.<br/>He thrust in deep, one hard push. Her pussy stretched tight around him, hot and soaking. Natasha cried out, nails digging into his shoulders.<br/>"Fuck, so tight," he groaned.<br/>He started pounding, hips slamming. Each thrust buried his dick balls-deep. Her breasts bounced wildly with every stroke. She wrapped legs around him, pulling him harder.<br/>"Harder... yes, like that!"<br/>Charles gripped her ass, lifting her slightly for deeper angles. His cock hit her spot over and over. Wet sounds filled the store, skin slapping skin.<br/>Natasha's pussy clenched, juices dripping down his shaft. She reached down, rubbing her clit fast while he fucked her.<br/>"I'm close," she moaned.<br/>He sped up, grunting. "Cum on my dick Natasha."<br/>Her body tensed. Pussy spasmed hard around him, milking his cock. She screamed softly, head thrown back as orgasm ripping through her.<br/>Charles felt his coming also, he  thrust twice more, then buried deep as he kept going faster. Grabbing her ass.<br/>“Mmm, yeah… boss.. my boss!”.<br/>His dick pulsed, shooting hot cum inside her. He groaned long, filling her pussy full.<br/>They panted, bodies slick with sweat. He pulled out slowly, watching his cum leak from her swollen lips.<br/>Natasha smiled weakly, pulling him for a kiss.<br/>"Best payment ever boss," she whispered.<br/>×××××<br/>After a few minutes, Charles left with his stones. As soon as he got home, he explained everything to Lizzypie, who became very angry at how the Moretti family was treating him.<br/>“You are not their slave or someone they can control any way they like. How dare they tell you what to do?” she said angrily.<br/>Charles shrugged, and Lizzypie added, “And Godfather still wants your relationship with Serena to continue. If you break up with her, it will be counted as null, and all rewards will be revoked.”<br/>Charles gasped and said, “Rewards will be revoked? That includes you?”<br/>Lizzypie nodded. “Yeah, sure. That includes me. I was your reward for your engagement to Serena.”<br/>Charles sighed. If Collins managed to secure the partnership with Mr. Damien, becoming Mr. Moretti’s favorite and taking the CEO position instead of Serena, then things would get even worse. Serena being the potential to become the CEO was the very reason Godfather had asked him to become her fiancé.<br/>That gave him many more reasons to kill Mr. Damien as soon as possible.<br/>“I have to kill Mr. Damien. I must get more power. I already have many gemstones from Natasha for upgrading,” he said.<br/>Lizzypie nodded and said, “Okay then… that’s great. I’m going somewhere. I will be back before night.”<br/>Lizzypie started preparing to go out. This time, Charles didn’t bother to ask where. As soon as she left, Charles went up to the rooftop, facing the sun as usual, and began meditating with the gem.<br/>He stayed there for many hours, until the sun set, absorbing a great deal of aura from it. Then his body tensed up.<br/>[Soul of Sight upgrading…. 100%]<br/>[Duration improved…. 20 seconds]<br/>Charles snapped his eyes open and felt delighted. With these 20 seconds, he could see much farther ahead, giving him even more power.<br/>“Yeah! I just have to sleep with a virgin, and I’ll unlock stage 4 of these Eyes of Satan. I’ll become even more powerful,” he told himself.<br/>He was still feeling happy when the rooftop door creaked open. He swiftly turned to see Sapphire standing there, wearing a very short gown that revealed most of her long legs and thighs, her breasts pushed up prominently.<br/>He gulped.<br/>Sapphire bowed slightly and said, “I’m sorry for disturbing you. Lizzypie told me you were here. I wanted to see you earlier, but I waited. It’s already dark now, and I need this urgently.”<br/>Charles frowned and walked toward her. “What is it? What do you need?”<br/>Sapphire bit her lip. “I’m sorry for always disturbing you, but I have to return to Winchester. I forgot my essential gadget for my machine—the chip that makes my project work. I left it at home. I need to go back and get it before Mr. Damien raids my house and finds it first.”<br/>Charles sighed. It was already getting dark.<br/>“So, you’re going to get it?” he asked.<br/>“Yes. I just wanted to inform you so you could look after the girls. I won’t be long—I will get the chip and return,” Sapphire said.<br/>Charles nodded, and was worried. It was extremely dangerous to go to Winchester alone, especially for her. Mr. Damien would certainly be waiting to ambush her.<br/>“Okay, let’s go together. I will have someone look after the girls.”<br/>“Oh, you don’t have to…” Sapphire started to refuse, but Charles insisted.<br/>“No way you are going there alone. Let me accompany you so you will be safe.”<br/>Sapphire agreed, and they set off.</div>
