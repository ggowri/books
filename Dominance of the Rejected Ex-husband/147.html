        <h1>Chapter 147</h1>
        <div><p>Even though the boys were long gone, Charles used his superpower, sprinting after them. </p><p>He then tapped into his soul sight. A glimpse of five seconds ahead showed the boys hiding inside an uncompleted building nearby.</p><p>He snapped back to the present, scanned the area, spotted the structure, and dashed toward it.</p><p>He ran inside.</p><p>The boys were really there, laughing loudly like the whole thing was a joke. Their laughter stopped the second they saw Charles storming in.</p><p>One of them stepped forward. “Hey, man. What are you doing here? Why did you follow us?”</p><p>Charles exhaled, trying to stay calm. “Look… we don’t have time. The girl is dying. Give me the inhaler. Now.”</p><p>All of them burst into laughter.</p><p>Charles frowned at their reaction, his patience thinning. How were they seeing this funny. </p><p>“So what?” one boy said. “How is it our problem that she&#x27;s dying?”</p><p>“I don’t have time for this,” Charles said. “We only have eight more minutes. Give me the inhaler.”</p><p>Another boy scoffed. “Yo, how is this any of your business? Huh? Oh—wait. Are you their sugar daddy? You fuck them? You pedo. We should report you to the police.”</p><p>They all laughed again, louder this time, mocking him like idiots.</p><p>Then one boy pulled out his phone and pointed it at Charles, recording him. Charles snapped. </p><p>In a blink, he walked towards the boy. Then Charles caught the boy’s arm and twisted it hard.</p><p>“YAAAH!” the boy screamed.</p><p>Charles tightened his grip. “Where is the inhaler? Give it to me. Now!”</p><p>“Now tell me,” Charles growled, twisting the boy’s arm harder, “where is the inhaler?”</p><p>The boy clenched his teeth, refusing to answer.</p><p>Charles twisted again. A cold crack popped through the air.</p><p>“AAAH—!” the boy screamed, then shouted at his friends, “Are you just going to watch? Do something! Don’t let him break my arm!”</p><p>The other boys rushed him at once.</p><p>Charles didn’t let go of the first boy’s arm. He yanked him forward like a shield, stepped aside, and slammed his knee into the stomach of the first boy who attacked. </p><p>The second boy tried to swing at him, but Charles ducked and drove an elbow into his chest, sending him crashing against the unfinished wall.</p><p>He still never loosened his grip on the main boy.</p><p>The boy screamed again. “Fuck you! You’re assaulting a teenager! You will go to jail for this!”</p><p>Charles’s patience snapped. “Just give me the inhaler!”</p><p>Even in pain, the boy scoffed. “Fuck you. She’s going to die. Same as you. Do you even know who my father is? He’ll kill you for touching me!”</p><p>Charles frowned deeply. Time was running out. He looked five seconds into the future again… and saw the same thing: the boy refusing to give up the inhaler no matter how much pain he took.</p><p>If he kept doing this, the girl would die.</p><p>He let go immediately.</p><p>The boy stumbled away, clutching his arm, and Charles’s chest tightened with fear. If they don’t give me that inhaler… she’ll die right there on that floor.</p><p>He sighed, voice breaking slightly. “Please. Just give it to me. Please… have mercy.”</p><p>The boys burst into laughter as the leader dusted himself off.</p><p>“Ohh, so you’ve come to your senses,” he mocked. “You were acting like Van Damme a minute ago.”</p><p>Charles swallowed hard. “Please. Just give me the inhaler. She is dying. I will do whatever you want.”</p><p>The leader smirked, obviously enjoying the power shift.</p><p>“Yeah. Now you are finally making sense. Where was all this before?”</p><p>“So where is it?” Charles asked.</p><p>The boy scoffed. “You think we will just give it to you after you beat me and my friends?”</p><p>Charles checked his wristwatch. Five minutes left.</p><p>“What do you want?” he asked quietly.</p><p>The boy folded his arms. “For what you just did? You will kneel down and beg us. You’ll act like you are begging for money… like a beggar. And I will record you while you’re doing it.”</p><p>Charles stared at him, stunned by the absurdity. If it wasn’t for that girl gasping for life in the alley, he would have broken this brat’s jaw for saying something that stupid.</p><p>The boy clicked his tongue. “Ughnn. Mr. Man, can’t do it? You don’t want to save your little pussy girl? Ughnn—she’s dying.”</p><p>Charles exhaled slowly. “You know I can’t do that.”</p><p>“Well,” the boy said, shrugging, “we aren’t forcing you.”</p><p>Charles closed his eyes, breathing deep. He looked further into the future, longer than five seconds this time—searching every branch of possibility.</p><p> And all he saw was the same outcome: fighting them wouldn’t work. Threatening wouldn’t work. Time would run out and the girl would die.</p><p>He lowered his head, defeated.</p><p>“Okay,” he said. “I will  do what you want.”</p><p>The boys grinned, thrilled.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” the leader sneered. “You look like a beggar anyway.”</p><p>With that, Charles slowly went down on his knees.</p><p>The moment Charles’ knees touched the dusty concrete, all three boys whipped out their phones and started recording..</p><p>“Alright,” the leader said, grinning wide. “Begin.”</p><p>Charles scoffed at himself inside, humiliation burning under his skin, but he had no choice. A girl was dying. Pride meant nothing compared to that.</p><p>He lowered his head and forced the words out.</p><p>“Please…” he said quietly. “Give me some money. Can I… can I have some money from you?”</p><p>The boys burst into soft, mocking laughter.</p><p>The boy recording stepped closer. “Hey guys, look at this,” he said into the camera. “I found this beggar on the road, and he’s begging me for money. I’m so generous, right? I will give him some. So pitiful.”</p><p>He pulled out a stack of money, flicked it between his fingers, and tossed it at Charles like feeding a stray animal.</p><p>“That’s it, beggar. You can take it.”</p><p>To keep the act believable, Charles picked up the money. </p><p>“Yes…” the boy recording said gleefully. “The beggar is happy. I just fulfilled his little wish.”</p><p>Charles forced the words out. “Thanks… thank you so much.” For the sake of saving a life.</p><p>Finally, after a few more seconds of filming, the boy lowered his phone and stopped the recording.</p><p>“Wow,” he said. “You act good. Better than I thought.”</p><p>Charles slowly rose to his feet, checking his watch.</p><p>Three minutes left.</p><p>“So,” he said, voice tightening, “where is the inhaler?”</p></div>
