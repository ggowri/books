  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of letting the League of Divine Descent or the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization off the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had once aided the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> in its assault on the Augustine family and plotted against the Draco Group's rare metal mines. For those reasons alone, he couldn't just forget about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for now, he decided against taking action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First and foremost, Osborne didn't have the strength to confront these two colossal factions head-on. Without overwhelming power to crush them, he wasn't about to make a move. After all, Osborne valued the lives of his subordinates and didn't want to send them to their deaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Secondly, there was the looming threat of the Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just wreaking havoc in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>; it was a global crisis, threatening cities everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization didn't concern him much. They were mercenaries at heart. Even if human cities were destroyed and countless innocents were slaughtered, they likely wouldn't lift a finger to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the League of Divine Descent was a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Divine Family was one of the most formidable powers in their respective countries, and their interests were deeply tied to the cities themselves. If those cities fell, they would suffer significant losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, like the Augustine family, they would have no choice but to send warriors to combat the Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne were to strike against the League of Divine Descent now, it would expose ordinary people across dozens of nations to the threat of Ferocious Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would suffer massive casualties, and entire cities could be overrun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his hatred for the League of Divine Descent, he wasn't willing to be the cause of such devastation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Once the </span><span>Beast Tide is dealt with, then I'll turn my attention to the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, I need to use this Beast Tide to strengthen my Blood Demon members. Once they all reach top-tier Class S or even forge Divine Bone and Divine Flesh to become true deities, who in this Blue Planet could stand against me? I'll sweep across the globe effortlessly, and all superpowers will have to bow before me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's not forget about the Dark Deities; they're a threat, too. Simply having my Blood Demon members at ordinary Class S strength isn't enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll use the blood energy from these Ferocious Beasts to boost their power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, alongside Anastasia and Zoe, waited patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Blood Demon were on their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's attention was caught by something in the distance. "Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?" Zoe asked, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint smile, Osborne pointed toward a direction. "There's someone over there! What audacity! They're only Class A but have dared to venture deep into the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains. Right now, they're being chased by a few Dark Exotic Beasts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And those beasts look a lot like big tigers. Shall we go check it out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's eyes lit up at the mention of tigers. "Yes! I want to see the big tiger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought there'd be plenty of big tigers among the Beast Tide, but it seems like they're all just oversized ordinary beasts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled at her enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Three months ago, there weren't any tigers in the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains. Tigers have been </span><span>endangered in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> for ages, so how could the Beast Tide conjure them out of thin air?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But some of those Dark Exotic Beasts do bear a resemblance to tigers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go take a look!" Osborne said, gathering his energy before using interdimensional travel to whisk the three of them away to a jungle 12 miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dense jungle, the sunlight barely penetrated the thick canopy above, casting a dim light on the chaotic scene below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vines and thorns intertwined with ferocity, making it almost impossible for an </span><span>average person to navigate through this tangled wilderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just a few hundred yards away, four figures, two men and two women, were sprinting for their lives. All of them were Class A warriors, and while the vines and thorns slowed them down, they were no match for their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them, nine Dark Exotic Beasts charged with ferocious intent, their sheer size rivaling that of elephants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These creatures were not merely mutated tigers. Their teeth and claws gleamed with wicked sharpness, but what truly set them apart were the formidable wings sprouting from their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wings resembled those of bats, sharp-edged like razors, allowing the beasts to slice through the foliage with ease, cutting vines, thorns, and even enormous trees like they were nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening roar that echoed through the jungle, one of the beasts startled a woman in the lead. Her face drained of color as she lost control, crashing into a massive tree and collapsing hard on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a Dark Exotic Beast lunged at her, fangs bared, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rihanna!" one of the men yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alarmed, the other three stopped in their tracks, their expressions shifting from fear to urgency as they rushed back to rescue her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, their prowess only reached Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Dark Exotic Beasts, all of them Class A as well, with their overpowering physiques, swiftly encircled the four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair settled in as the four looked into the eyes of their impending doom.</span></p><div class="pagination">
