  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As God of Time's hand descended, poised to strike Anastasia down, the surrounding crowd remained frozen in place, unable to intervene. It seemed that no one could save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as the deadly blow was about to land, God of Time's hand suddenly halted inches from Anastasia's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of struggle crossed God of Time's features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered under her breath. "Damn it! Ophelia, you're just my reincarnation! "I've sealed your consciousness, and yet you dare to surface and stop me from killing her? Are you not afraid that I'll crush your essence forever, making you disappear completely?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why won't you let me kill her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's Osborne's sister! If I kill her and then him, no one will know you ever married him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I command you to let me kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's furious soliloquy left Anastasia stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it dawned on her quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "So it's Ophelia's consciousness that's stopping God of Time? She's trying to save me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said that once God of Time's memories returned, Ophelia's consciousness would be sealed away! So, technically, the one controlling this body isn't Ophelia at all&mdash;it's the God of Time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time wants to kill me, but the sealed Ophelia is fighting against her! Ophelia, why do you want to save me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's expression turned contemplative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, God of Time snorted, raising her hand again, her murderous intent boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite her fury, her hand remained suspended in the air, unable to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, God of Time lowered her hand, glaring at Anastasia with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lucky! That damned Ophelia is putting up a fight to save you! Otherwise, you'd be dead by now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia retorted, "You should be thankful Ophelia saved you! If you had killed me just now, it would have been the end of your life too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time laughed, the sound harsh and mocking. "Ha! You think so? You really believe in Osborne's strength? You think he's impressive? How laughable! You have no idea what I'm capable of!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Osborne showed up right now, I could take him out without breaking a sweat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's expression hardened, and she let out a dismissive snort, unwilling to engage further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only fueled God of Time's anger. "Oh, you don't believe me? Fine! Where is your brother? I'll go find him myself, and I'll kill him right in front of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia turned her head, ignoring God of Time completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's face darkened, and she let out a cold huff. "So you really aren't afraid of death, huh? Do you think Ophelia can keep stopping me? I'm only letting you live a little longer for now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia finally spoke up, "God of Time, if you're so powerful, why not take on the Dark Deity Legion? Fight the Paramount Supreme Clan instead of flexing your muscles in front of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's voice was icy. "Do you think I need your advice? I'm here to confront the Dark Deity Legion and the Paramount Supreme Clan! The Human Community of Celestara is under the protection of the God of Night, so naturally, I'll help safeguard it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That foolish God of Light got herself killed by Icy One and the other Dark Sovereigns, and even the Sanctum of Light was shattered! I won't be that stupid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll lead the Human Alliance to fend off the Dark Deity Legion's invasion until the God of Night returns!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, excitement and anticipation filled God of Time's demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her icy gaze back to Anastasia. "Now, watch closely and see just how powerful I am! Osborne thinks he can compete with me? That's a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he dares to show his face, I'll kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not even Ophelia can stop me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a snap of her fingers, time resumed its flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samson's hand was lunging toward Anastasia, his face twisted with savage excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, his expression froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed a strikingly tall and beautiful goddess standing before Anastasia, her demeanor cold and formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura radiating from this woman made his heart race with an unsettling dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Samson pushed the feeling aside and continued his advance. "The Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community, your doom is upon you! Surrender to the Paramount Supreme Clan, and they will accept our capitulation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Samson's hand was about to grasp Anastasia, God of Time suddenly intervened, her hand clamping around his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force erupted, lifting Samson off the ground, and leaving him suspended in midair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's voice was icy. "It's you&mdash;the one who's been preaching surrender?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing but scum from the Human Community! A thousand years ago, the Seven Great Deity Kings made immense sacrifices to save the Human Community, defeating Lord Malevolence and sealing him away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, you want to give up without a fight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you're honoring the God of Night? Do you think you're honoring the sacrifices made by the Seven Great Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you can die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, God of Time's fingers tightened, and a horrific crack echoed as she snapped Samson's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his body exploded, his life force extinguished amidst the shocked gasps of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samson was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of disbelief rippled through the onlookers, their astonished faces reflecting a mix of shock and terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samson, an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Icy Five and Icy Four would struggle to defeat him, let alone kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, effortlessly dispatched by a seemingly young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying scene sent the Human Alliance into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone dared to break the silence. "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time offered a chilling smile but didn't answer directly. Instead, she soared into the sky, her cold gaze sweeping over the Human Alliance below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, everyone in the Human Alliance! I am the God of Time, and I have returned! The God of Light is dead, and from now on, everyone must obey my commands as we stand against the Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it costs us our lives, we must hold the line! We must wait for the God of Night's return!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to suggest surrender again will face death at my hands&mdash;no exceptions! Just look at what happened to Samson, the traitor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her chilling words, God of Time's gaze swept across the crowd, and every leader of the Human Community felt an icy shiver run down their spine, gripped by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was said that God of Time had perished a thousand years ago, but here she stands, stronger than ever, effortlessly annihilating Samson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's the God of Time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We, the Human Community, finally have hope again! The God of Light may be gone, but the God of Time has returned! With her here, the Dark Deity Legion won't easily breach Peaks City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long live the God of Time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long live the Human Community!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
