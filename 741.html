  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Super Energy Pistol?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at the disheveled man in surprise. "Are you the head of the Weapons Research Institute?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man nodded quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I am indeed the head of the Weapons Research Institute. My name is Kash Hopkins, and I've been in charge of energy weapon research. The energy pistol is my creation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Kash with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that this man was the creator of the energy pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His interest piqued immediately. "What did you just say about a super energy pistol? Tell me more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Kash became even more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, the super energy pistol is an upgraded version of the energy pistol. Due to the limitations of Energex Materials, the power of the energy pistol has a cap. At most, it can pose a threat to an ordinary Class A master, but it's practically ineffective against anyone stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been contemplating what kind of Energex Materials could make the energy pistol more powerful. It is something that could pose a threat to Class AA or even Class AAA individuals. My ultimate goal is for it to be a viable threat to a Class S Supreme Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, I could never find the right Energex Materials until a few days ago. Godfather sent over a material similar to pyrite called the Divine Bone Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Divine Bone Crystal contains a terrifying energy. Once I used it as an Energex Material, the experiment was a swift success! Now, the super energy pistol has been developed. Its power far exceeds that of a regular energy pistol."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kash finished speaking, Osborne was even more astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "The Divine Bone Crystal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Kash used the Divine Bone Crystal as an Energex Material to create the super energy pistol, how powerful could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deeply intrigued by the weapon, Osborne quickly said, "Show me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, Mr. Augustine. Please, follow me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kash, brimming with excitement, led Osborne to the Weapons Research Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The institute was located on the twenty-eighth underground level&mdash;the lowest floor. The walls around them were made of the strongest alloys, reinforced to an unbelievable degree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that even a nuclear explosion couldn't damage these walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place was not only the Weapons Research Institute but also an impenetrable safe house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, this way, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kash guided Osborne into a room and carefully retrieved a handgun with a bronze sheen from a vault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The handgun looked identical to a regular energy pistol, with the only difference being the magazine area, where a square Divine Bone Crystal was embedded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took the pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, the activation of the super energy pistol differs from that of a regular energy pistol. The user needs to inject a certain amount of energy to activate the unique energy within the Divine Bone Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already tested it. Any Class A master or higher possesses sufficient energy to activate the super energy pistol. The stronger the energy, the greater the power unleashed from the Divine Bone Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I speculate that if the energy within a single Divine Bone Crystal were fully activated at once, even a Class S Supreme Overlord would be forced to retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kash finished, his body trembled with excitement. His eyes were fixed on the super energy pistol, gazing at it as if it were a lover, filled with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, felt a wave of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Even a Class S Supreme Overlord would have to retreat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly recalled the recent incident when Godfather activated a Divine Bone Crystal. The energy blast from the explosion had been so intense that even Godfather was pushed back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy from that Divine Bone Crystal explosion had dispersed in all directions, and Godfather had only faced a portion of the shockwave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought that if all the power from a Divine Bone Crystal exploded in a single direction, it might indeed harm a Class S Supreme Overlord like Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anticipation grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to give it a try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always had a passion for firearms, but with his current level of strength, the power of any regular firearm was too weak to excite him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, only divine artifacts were worthy of his interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the super energy pistol was as powerful as Kash claimed, it could very well be on par with typical divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, please feel free to try it out. The walls here are made of the strongest alloys, composed of many materials that don't exist on Earth, extracted from extraterrestrial meteorites. Even a Class S Supreme Overlord would find it hard to destroy this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over there are humanoid targets of various levels, each built to reflect the average defensive strength of warriors from Class A to Class S using special materials."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, gripping the super energy pistol tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began injecting energy into the gun and immediately felt it devour a significant amount of his energy as if it were a bottomless pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Kash said that to activate the super energy pistol, one needed to be at least at the level of a Class A master.</span></p><div class="pagination">
