  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was out of sight, Osborne quickly activated his spatial power, vanishing from Apocalypse City in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt was unceremoniously tossed into the Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Kurt's followers were just starting to process what had happened, their faces turning pale with realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chase him! Don't let him get away!" one of them shouted, panic rising in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! The Baxter family must have heard the news by now. Reinforcements will be here any minute! We can't let him escape, or we're in deep trouble!" another urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move it!" They all cried, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a group of powerful figures from the Baxter family arrived, all at the peak of the Deity King level. Their response was swift. They quickly sealed off the nearby streets and initiated a thorough search, but they found nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a figure resembling Kurt appeared on the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they caught sight of him, their expressions turned serious, and they bowed their heads in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Mr. Trevor Baxter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was none other than Kurt's father, Trevor, one of the Supernal Deity Kings of the Baxter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's demeanor was remarkably calm. He didn't erupt in rage or madness over his son's abduction. Instead, his tranquility sent chills down the spines of those around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After scanning the area for what felt like an eternity, he finally spoke, "Now, let's hear what happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fell upon the group of young men and women, who suddenly felt a wave of dread wash over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shivered uncontrollably, their legs turning to jelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One brave soul stepped forward to explain, "Mr. Trevor Baxter, it's like this. Mr. Baxter heard that the Luminous Commerce Center had stocked ten Miracle Elixirs, and he wanted to check it out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After recounting, he continued, "That man not only wielded Thunder Power but was also a soul power wielder. Mr. Baxter's Luminous Armor couldn't withstand his soul attacks at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We weren't a match for him, and by the time we tried to chase him, he had vanished without a trace..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the group trembled, waiting for their fate like condemned prisoners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor narrowed his eyes slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound escaped his lips, and instantly, every member of the group shuddered, a terrible pressure enveloping them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In Apocalypse City, someone actually dared to lay a hand on my son! And he had the audacity to demand ten sets of Ultimate Luminous Armor and three Ultimate divine artifacts related to lightning? He's robbing me right to my face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What boldness! I can't believe there are such audacious young people in our Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done! Well done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Trevor spoke, a fierce killing intent radiated from him, causing the group to cower in fear, some even losing control of their bladders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor ignored their terror. "Tomorrow, at Astral Wolf Peak?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, it's just ten sets of Ultimate Luminous Armor and three Ultimate divine artifacts. I'll give them to you&mdash;but you better be alive to collect them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured to himself before turning his icy gaze back to the trembling group. "My son Kurt went out with you, and you all returned unscathed while he was captured! You deserve to die a thousand deaths! If that man hadn't specifically requested you to deliver the items tomorrow, I would have already crushed you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, the group shook even more violently, their fear palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood that Trevor meant business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if their fathers were high-ranking members of First-rate Powers, Trevor wouldn't bat an eye. If he decided to kill them on the spot, their fathers wouldn't dare confront him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they would likely have to apologize to the Baxter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Trevor was a Supernal Deity King, and the Baxter family was a Dukedom Level Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument, "Get up! We're heading back to the Baxter family. Tomorrow, I need your cooperation. If we manage to catch that bastard, you'll have redeemed yourselves. But if you screw this up, you all have to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group exchanged terrified glances, their fear palpable. Yet, there was no room for hesitation. They quickly scrambled to their feet, trembling as they fell in line behind Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked, Trevor lifted his gaze toward the Luminous Commerce Center, nodding slightly before turning away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Baxter family members soon followed suit, leaving the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the Luminous Commerce Center, calm finally returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the top floor of the Luminous Commerce Center, Supernal Deity King Xanto watched as Trevor departed, his brow furrowing in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xanto mused, shaking his head, "That Theodore is getting too bold! I told him to take the back exit, and he completely disregarded my instructions! He just had to go and snatch Kurt...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I have to admit, that guy's strength is impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt is no slouch. He's one of the top young talents in Apocalypse City, yet Theodore managed to take him down with ease. He's not far off from the likes of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it a requirement for anyone named 'Theodore' to be a prodigy?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
