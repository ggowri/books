  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even those who had broken through to Empyrean Sacredness began to struggle against the warriors' projections. Most could no longer swiftly defeat these projections within one breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many even found it extremely difficult to finish the battle within three breaths or five breaths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, only a dozen or so people managed to earn the highest reward of 100,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others received rewards of 50,000, 20,000, or even just 10,000.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This outcome made everyone's expressions grow even more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is only the sixth level! At this rate of increasing difficulty, it won&rsquo;t be long before even clearing the levels becomes a major challenge, let alone aiming for the highest battle points reward," someone said worriedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were only on the sixth level, while the Celestial Spire had a total of ninety-nine levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Judging by the current difficulty growth trend, they would likely face an extremely tough situation by the ninth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone questioned whether the Celestial Spire needed to be built so high.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the Celestial Spire, which only allows those below the Empyrean Sacredness realm to enter, everyone doubted whether anyone could truly pass all ninety-nine levels of trials.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearing twenty levels would already be quite impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, their goal was only the eighteenth level. As long as they reached it, they could obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket and complete the mission.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seraphina, the difficulty is rising rapidly!" At this moment, even the other princes and princesses felt unprecedented pressure. "At this rate, reaching the eighteenth level is almost impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Seraphina remained calm. "Why are you panicking?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The first nine levels of the Celestial Spire must be cleared alone, relying solely on individual strength to overcome challenges. But from the tenth to the eighteenth level, we can team up and work together! By then, with everyone's combined efforts, there's a good chance we'll clear the eighteenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, we must clear the eighteenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She paused, her cold gaze sweeping over the other five princes and princesses, and continued, "You should know how important obtaining the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket is to Father! If we fail, our fate will be extremely miserable!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To strengthen our abilities, Father has already spent a great deal of resources and treasures on us. You'd better pray that we can clear the eighteenth level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, the group couldn't help but tremble all over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone said in unison, "We understand!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they had already reached the seventh level, where the clearance rewards had increased tenfold again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The minimum reward was 10,000 battle points, while the maximum reward reached 1,000,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, they needed to face three warriors' projections, each as strong as Seraphina before her breakthrough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This undoubtedly made the difficulty skyrocket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most people found it hard to quickly defeat these three warriors' projections, and those who could finish the battle within ten breaths were very few.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Seraphina's strength before the breakthrough was already formidable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, only six people could defeat the three warriors' projections within one breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was those six princes and princesses who had reached Mid Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them received a reward of one million battle points, quickly widening the gap with others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others were envious but helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this is the gap in strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Osborne and his three companions, they also faced considerable trouble on the seventh level, especially Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey's strength was ultimately a bit lacking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, she took nearly two breaths to barely defeat three warriors' projections, earning only 500,000 battle points as a reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, Osborne, Clara, and Leroy passed with ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Casey was full of envy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help her either, as the trials here had to be undertaken individually. If two people entered the light beam's range at the same time, the trial wouldn't activate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, having more or fewer battle points doesn't really matter," Clara tried to comfort Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey nodded, showing she didn't mind. "Don't worry, I'm fine! I never planned to compete with you guys anyway."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Casey was in a good mood, Osborne didn't say anything further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they arrived at the eighth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, they had to face ten real warriors' projections, each possessing the strength Seraphina had before her breakthrough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even the princes and princesses had to give it their all to quickly end the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, only a few princes and princesses received the highest rewards.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among Osborne and the others, only Casey still managed to earn 500,000 battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they reached the ninth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celestial Spire has a total of ninety-nine floors, and for every nine floors cleared, one Skyfall Casket key can be obtained. However, the Ninth Skyfall Casket key belonging to the ninth floor was taken away countless millennia ago by the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, even if Seraphina and her companions successfully reached the ninth floor, they couldn't obtain the Skyfall Casket key. They had to keep moving forward and pass the test of the eighteenth floor to acquire the Eighth Skyfall Casket key.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this was their ultimate goal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's focus on clearing the ninth floor first. Once you pass this test, your battle points can be exchanged for various resources and treasures!" Seraphina skillfully led the group to the testing site on the ninth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She once again stepped into the beam of light first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a warrior's projection appeared not far from her, exuding a strong aura of Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primary Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the ninth test, the warriors' projections have finally reached the cultivation level of Empyrean Sacredness. In other words, if those entering the Celestial Spire cannot break through to Empyrean Sacredness, they might not even pass the ninth floor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd murmured softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina had already made her move. She still didn&rsquo;t take out her Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Blackstar Bow. With just her bare hands, she instantly shattered the Primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior's projection, earning another million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle points above her head rose to 3.33 million.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She completed the tests of the first nine floors in just one breath each time, earning the highest battle points reward every time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, almost everyone looked at her with admiration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina's strength is incredible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Facing the Primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors' projection, she could effortlessly resolve the battle without even using any Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such strength is simply terrifying!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd buzzed with discussion, and soon Emiliano, Matthew, and others stepped into the light beam one after another to begin their trials.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, apart from Emiliano and Matthew, the other three princes and princesses barely passed the trial after nearly three breaths of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These three princes and princesses only received 500,000 battle points as a reward in the ninth stage, making their expressions particularly grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the others, it was even more tragic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they had all reached Primary Empyrean Sacredness, losing the advantage in cultivation level meant that even the fastest among them took nearly ten breaths to pass the trial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, most people accumulated less than one million battle points in total.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, everyone managed to pass successfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina said, "Alright, take a break now. I'll take you to redeem your rewards. Otherwise, the next place to redeem rewards is on the eighteenth level. If you can't reach the eighteenth level, there will be no chance to redeem rewards, and those battle points will be wasted!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina led everyone to the Battle Points Monument.</span></p><div class="pagination">
