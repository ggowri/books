  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon saying this, Clarissa's body went limp, and she almost fell over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rushed to her side and hugged her body, looking worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Idiot, you don't have to fight so desperately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa defeated Duke Medusa, Duke Titan and Duke Werewolf. She was extremely fast, as if she killed them all with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she had it far easier than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne knew that Clarissa had played to her limits in order to do this. For Clarissa, both Retribution for Fate and the power of the Trident of Poseidon in the final excessive outburst required her to be under so much stress that she had almost run out of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was only doing this to prove to Osborne that she was ready to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was touched in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if my Light of Redemption would work on someone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, Osborne decided to give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was just exhausted, and she didn't have any injuries on her body. Even if it wouldn't do any good for her to execute the divine healing on Osborne, and it would consume more mental strength instead, or even he would fall into a coma, his Light of Redemption could restore the strength and state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light of Redemption!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne triggered the power of the light elemental, and suddenly a ray of light fell from the sky. Under Osborne's control, the light fell on Clarissa's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Clarissa's pale face became full of energy again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power she had consumed and mental strength were all instantly replenished and restored to peak state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa felt confused, and she blinked in Osborne's arms, looking incredibly adorable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne couldn't help but smile in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Light of Redemption could truly be used to restore the state of someone else, but Osborne could still only perform it once. If he wanted to do it next time, he would need to wait half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne didn't care at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three warriors who had reached Class AAA that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had left at the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> had all been killed by Clarissa at this moment, and the rest of them had been killed or injured in the onslaught from members of the Blood Demon Organization, and they could barely fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't need to use the Light of Redemption for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be so desperate next time, and I'm here! You can't drain your power. Otherwise, who will help me heal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scratched Clarissa's nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa blushed and nodded. "I just wanted to try my limits, and I won't do it next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Clarissa looked over at the battlefield. She waved her hand and dropped the divine healing to heal the injured members from the Blood Demon Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was soon over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> remaining at their headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> was formidable with three Class AAA dukes, a dozen Class AA marquises, and nearly two hundred Class A marquis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a force was enough to clear out most of the top ancient families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, now they were all killed by Clarissa as well as members from the Blood Demon Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their losses were minimal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All members of the Blood Demon Organization were incredibly excited at this moment. This was their first real battle, and they didn't let Osborne down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strength completely destroyed the enemy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to get busy after a few compliments. He transformed into Blood Clan and began to collect the power of the rich blood energy scattered across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross in his body became abundant once again. As he absorbed a large amount of blood energy, he became even more powerful, and so much of his power escaped and strengthened his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and withdrew all of the power that filled the Blood Cross, turning it into drops of blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five hundred and twenty-one drops of blood energy quickly appeared in Osborne's palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand and all the blood energy flew in front of Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin, you are the leader of the logistics department of the Blood Demon Organization, so distribute this blood energy to everyone, and this is the spoils of war that you deserve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, absorb the blood energy as quickly as possible. After everyone has finished resting, we will continue on our journey!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just the beginning of our counterattack at the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. Later, there are three more rare metal mines and six more general industry sites, and we're going to attack them all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're going to kick the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> out of </span><span>Dampston</span><span> today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took Clarissa's hand and walked into the headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone from the Blood Demon Organization was incredibly excited at this moment. Everyone had received a drop of pure blood energy, which had been quenched by Blood Cross. For those who came from the Blood Clan like them, this was more precious than anything else, and it could allow them to rapidly increase their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five hundred and twenty-one members from the Blood Demon Organization all began to absorb blood energy at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first ones to finish were the twenty members who had reached Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they didn't make it to the next level after absorbing the blood energy, and their energy became more powerful, and they were steadily reaching Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, many members from the Blood Demon Organization began to break through from Class A to Class A+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, when everyone had absorbed the blood energy, the number of members from the Blood Demon Organization who had reached Class A+ was up to two hundred, and the others were also very close to reaching Class A+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they gained another drop of blood energy, they would inevitably break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were even some who would start breaking through Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was not concerned about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clicked on the ranking list and looked at his points and rankings.</span></p><div class="pagination">
