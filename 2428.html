  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many times, people don't fail to do something; they just haven't been told they can!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne is an example.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Leroy hadn't mentioned that after time elemental essence breaks through the Sacredness Level, simple Time Retrace could be performed, Osborne still wouldn't know.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And once he knew, everything became simpler because this was an ability he already possessed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, a person has great wealth, but it's locked in a safe. One day, someone tells him the safe can be opened with a password.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, opening the safe becomes very simple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, after a simple attempt, Osborne quickly mastered the ability of Time Retrace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye, flickering with ocular energy, enveloped the area that had recently been a battlefield. Instantly, scenes began flashing before his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These scenes were rapidly rewinding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne saw Brenda and the others, saw her effortlessly take down at least twenty thousand Ice Beetles with the Ice Scepter, saw the Ice Beetles injure and kill contestants one by one...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also saw that it was Brenda who secretly awakened the Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the scenes vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of weakness. The brief Time Retrace had surprisingly left him exhausted. His soul power was greatly depleted. Fortunately, the Chaotic Spiritual Root could restore his soul power. He quickly returned to normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his expression was quite strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong? Did you succeed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara were both looking at Osborne at this moment, their expressions somewhat expectant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara were stunned; he had actually succeeded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, they finally calmed down and asked, "So what exactly happened here before?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment, then began to explain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he finished speaking, Leroy and Clara were stunned again, looking incredulous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda actually used such despicable means?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She deliberately woke up the Ice Beetles, letting them cause casualties among other contestants to force them into distribution agreements favorable to her. Then she used the Ultimate Sacred Artifact to wipe out over twenty thousand Ice Beetles in one move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the end, the other contestants even thanked Brenda and admired her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered, "I originally thought Brenda was an impressive woman. I even admired her a bit! But I never expected her to be this evil!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She was clearly exploiting the other contestants!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She even watched those contestants get killed by the Ice Beetles."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If there were no other contestants, even with the Ultimate Sacred Artifact, the Ice Scepter, she couldn't have easily dealt with so many Ice Beetles!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's a treacherous villain!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm going to expose her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy was somewhat indignant. If it weren't for Osborne's ability to perform Time Retrace, she wouldn't have known Brenda was such a despicable person. She might still think Brenda was impressive and continue to admire her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! Don't be mad!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara grabbed Leroy. "How are you going to expose her? Do you think the other contestants will believe what you say? They won't! If they ask you for evidence, what will you do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you going to tell them that Osborne has time powers and can Time Retrace to see what happened in the past? Wouldn't that expose his secret?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, let's just leave this alone!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara's words calmed Leroy down a bit. She felt Clara made sense, but she was still angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "But are we really going to ignore this? Brenda, she got fifteen thousand Ice Beetles in one go. That's thirty million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She has the Ice Scepter and so many contestants deceived into helping her. So next, she'll definitely get a huge amount of Ice Beetles, and her Kingdom Duel Scorepoints will skyrocket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What if she threatens Osborne's chances of winning the championship?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Leroy finished speaking, Clara frowned, looking a bit worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne simply smiled and said, "No need to worry!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda has the Ultimate Sacred Artifact, the Ice Scepter, but I have Flash! The power of her Ice Scepter isn't unlimited and will eventually run out, but the power of Flash can be restored."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, taking the championship from me won't be that easy! But moving forward, we do need to work a bit harder!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne squinted his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, he thought the championship was already his, and no one could compete with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Brenda gave him a bit of pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "To my surprise, Brenda also has a way to quickly deal with Ice Beetles. Moreover, her Golden Dragon Eye can detect the Ice Beetles sleeping deep within the glacier..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I don't put in more effort, I might really lose to her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! Let's keep moving! Let's compete with Brenda and see who's better!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They rode a warhorse with Osborne, continuing to gallop across the glacier. This time, however, they moved even faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also fully activated Satan's Eye, searching for the Ice Beetles beneath the glacier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed his Satan's Eye was definitely stronger than Brenda's Golden Dragon Eye, and the power of Flash was surely greater than her Ice Scepter!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if she had over 800 contestants helping her, he was determined not to lose!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Before, I also thought Brenda was not bad, but I never expected her to be so ruthless, and she'd stop at nothing for profit! Since that's the case, I won't show her any mercy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want the championship? Then I'll make sure you can't get it! In fact, I won't even let you take second or third place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne came up with a big plan!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to bring Clara and Leroy to the second and third places, letting them defeat Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, achieving this won't be easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Brenda gets 50% of the team's earnings, while Clara and Leroy each only get 20%."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To make Clara and Leroy's earnings exceed Brenda's, I need to kill at least 2.5 times more Ice Beetles than Brenda's entire team!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It might even need to reach three or four times to be safe!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Brenda's team kills 10,000 Ice Beetles, I need to kill 30,000 to ensure Clara and Leroy rank higher than her and push her out of the top three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally felt the pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that's what makes it interesting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought that although it wouldn't be easy, it wasn't impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His reliance was on his Satan's Eye and Flash, and even the Time Retrace he had just mastered!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time Retrace might help him find Ice Beetles faster!</span></p><div class="pagination">
