  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana's stunning face came into Osborne's view. She stood quietly in the distance. Her figure, her appearance, everything was flawless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A faint smile hung on her lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, the sudden collapse of Aaron's cage barrier was Adriana's doing. And Osborne's inability to use Phantom Steps was also because of Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana indeed possessed such strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom, and even across the Racial Convergence Planet, Adriana was a top-tier existence. Like Osborne's father in his previous life, the Glorious Divine Emperor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, she had reached the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her strength far surpassed Aaron, a warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the leader of Skyearth Dominion was defeated by Adriana back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Aaron also saw Adriana. When he noticed that Adriana seemed quite familiar with Osborne, his expression changed drastically, and he turned to flee without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he no longer thought about killing Osborne, nor did he want to reclaim the Ice Scepter from him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only wanted to escape from this place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in front of Adriana, Aaron had no chance to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cold snort from Adriana, the frantically fleeing Aaron let out a piercing scream, spewing blood from his mouth as his body was violently flung back and crashed heavily near Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't even see how Adriana made her move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene left him stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was simply too powerful!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron, at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, was already one of the top warriors in the Glorious Divine Kingdom. But in front of Adriana, he was like a fragile child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was filled with doubt. "The gap between Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness and Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection is just half a cultivation level. Why is the difference in strength so vast? Or is Ms. Alba simply too powerful?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just sneered at the severely injured Aaron, his heart filled with delight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Aaron severely injured Flash, and now it's his turn to suffer the same fate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is entirely the price he deserves!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Aaron struggled to stand up, ignoring the blood at the corner of his mouth, and anxiously questioned, "Ms. Alba, what do you mean by this? Skyearth Dominion and Fairy Moon Sect have no grievances. Attacking me without a word is going too far!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana did not respond immediately but instead stepped forward, slowly approaching Aaron.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her steps seemed slow and composed, but her speed was astonishing. Osborne clearly realized that even if he used spatial power, escaping would likely be impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Adriana was already in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her stunningly beautiful face was now covered with frost as she gazed indifferently at Aaron. "I injured you? Too much, you say? Then what about you hunting down my disciple for no reason&mdash;isn't that excessive? Let me tell you, injuring you is nothing. Even killing you would be your own doing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've never acknowledged Adriana as my master, so why would she say that?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne did not deny it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Aaron came from a First-rate Power no less than the Fairy Moon Sect&mdash;Skyearth Dominion. Adriana needed a reasonable reason and excuse to act against Aaron.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your disciple?" Aaron's face was full of shock at this moment, completely in disbelief. If he had known earlier, he would never have dared to target Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "So Osborne is your disciple. I had no idea before. If I had known, I definitely wouldn't have acted against him; instead, I would have protected him well. I realize my mistake and apologize to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You've already taught me a lesson, so can I leave now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Aaron appeared incredibly humble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no choice but to do so. After all, this was a cruel world. Adriana, as a super warrior at the pinnacle of the Racial Convergence Planet pyramid, possessed the power to take his life effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he didn't bow his head, death would be his only path.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, not to mention a humble apology, even if he had to kneel and beg for mercy, he could only comply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone like him, who had lived for tens of thousands of years, cherished life even more. Things like dignity were not as important as staying alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This concept was hard for young people like Osborne to understand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked at Aaron with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana turned to Osborne and said calmly, "Osborne, what do you think should be done with him? If he apologizes to you, would you accept it? If you don't want to, then I'll kill him for you! Even though he's the deputy leader of Skyearth Dominion, their leader wouldn't dare trouble me even if I killed him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana's expression grew colder, her eyes full of confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words sent a shiver through Aaron, filling his heart with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he knew Adriana truly dared to do so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Aaron quickly turned his gaze to Osborne and hurriedly said, "Osborne, please allow me to sincerely apologize to you. I swear, from now on, I will never trouble you again and will keep everything that happened today a secret. As long as you forgive me, I'll do whatever you want."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne heard this and immediately began to ponder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's meaning was clear: as long as he refused to accept Aaron's apology, she would eliminate this threat for him. Moreover, Skyearth Dominion would never dare to retaliate against Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne believed Adriana's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he wouldn't forgive Aaron easily. After all, Aaron not only tried to kill him but also seriously injured Flash. If Adriana hadn't arrived in time, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne wished he could personally end Aaron's life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he didn't want Adriana to help him. He neither wanted to trouble her nor owe too many favors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was determined to take revenge on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne made a decision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared coldly at Aaron and said, "Aaron, is this your way of apologizing? Just saying a few words and trying to brush it off? Don't forget, you almost killed me just now and nearly got my pet beast killed. If you don't offer enough compensation, don't expect me to forgive you easily! Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron's mouth twitched slightly after hearing this. "Then what do you want?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly responded, "It's simple! You must swear by the Divine Principle never to reveal today's events to anyone and never to trouble me in any way again. Otherwise, you will be crushed by the Divine Principle, with no chance of reincarnation ever!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Adriana immediately showed a look of surprise. "How do you know about the Divine Principle? And how do you understand that swearing by the Divine Principle holds such powerful binding force?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and replied, "I just read about it in an ancient book."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded lightly and asked no more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, the reason Osborne knew about the Divine Principle was that Primordial had just told him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "In this universe, there exists a supreme system of rules, with the most fundamental being the Divine Principle. Any being surpassing the Empyrean Sacredness realm, once swearing by the Divine Principle, will have their aura captured by it. If they break their oath, they will face severe punishment from the Divine Principle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne continued to pressure Aaron, "Aaron! Swear by the Divine Principle immediately and compensate me adequately, at least with a Supreme Sacred Artifact, or I might consider forgiving you! Otherwise, prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared directly at Aaron, his eyes full of threat and oppression.</span></p><div class="pagination">
