  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Sanctum of Light, the God of Light furrowed her brow as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I've gathered the elite from the HeartUnited Alliance, the Jackson family, and the Hudson family as you requested. They're here to ensure your safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can't wrap my head around your reasoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Eight Dark Sovereigns are truly determined to come after you, the strength of the HeartUnited Alliance, the Jackson family, and the Hudson family won't be enough to protect you! Even someone like Tanner or Julian, who are Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, wouldn't stand a chance against the weakest of the Eight Dark Sovereigns, Icy Eight or Icy Seven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's alright. The more people we have, the better I feel. While they may not be able to take on the Eight Dark Sovereigns, even a second of delay in a critical moment could change the outcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light considered this and nodded, choosing not to argue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Julian from the HeartUnited Alliance, Tanner from the Jackson family, and Jethro from the Hudson family arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Esteemed God of Light, you called for us?" Tanner said with deep respect, glancing at Osborne and the others with a polite smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, on the other hand, didn't even spare a glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was gloomy with anger; the slap Osborne had given him had been humiliating, and even though Osborne's subsequent display of power had made him a hero in the Human Community, Julian had no desire to mend fences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light nodded at them and got straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I brought you here to protect the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! They've just dealt a crushing blow to the Paramount Supreme Clan in today's matches and have become heroes for our people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect the Paramount Supreme Clan won't let this slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Eight Dark Sovereigns will likely seize the opportunity to assassinate them. If they succeed, the Human Community might find itself in a dire situation again, just like a couple of days ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Eight Dark Sovereigns attack together, even I can't guarantee their safety! That's why I need you to gather your strongest to protect them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After God of Light finished speaking, Jethro remained calm, fully aware of Osborne's plans as Osborne's grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner and Julian, however, were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want us to protect the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?" they echoed in unison, glancing at Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's lips twitched as he struggled with his reluctance, wanting to voice his objections but ultimately holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner, however, grinned and said, "Ah, I see! The Seven Young Deity Kings are now heroes of the Human Community, and their talents are legendary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, they just put the Paramount Supreme Clan in their place, taking down over two hundred of their Supernal Deity Kings, including ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's an impressive feat! After a century of conflict between the Jackson family and the Paramount Supreme Clan, we haven't achieved anything close! If I were part of the Paramount Supreme Clan, I'd do everything I could to eliminate them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Jackson family is more than willing to do everything in our power to protect the Seven Young Deity Kings! Esteemed God of Light, let me gather more of the Jackson family's elite. I've already called upon a hundred Supernal Deity Kings, but it seems that's not enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll summon the rest, bringing over three hundred Supernal Deity Kings from the Jackson family to protect the Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it costs us everything, safeguarding them is worth it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner spoke with a sense of righteous determination, and Osborne couldn't help but nod in appreciation, gratitude evident on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light regarded Tanner with approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she turned her attention to Julian. "Mr. Cullen, what about the HeartUnited Alliance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's expression darkened; the thought of sending his people to protect Osborne didn't sit well with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, Julian gritted his teeth and said, "The HeartUnited Alliance will follow your orders, the esteemed God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you deem the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings so important and want us to protect them, we won't hold back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will dispatch two hundred Supernal Deity Kings to guard them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light nodded approvingly at this declaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jethro spoke up, "The Hudson family will also send two hundred Supernal Deity Kings to protect the Seven Young Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner and Julian turned to him, their expressions a blend of shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian frowned, clearly skeptical. "What? The Hudson family is sending two hundred Supernal Deity Kings? You must be kidding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where on earth does the Hudson family even have that many Supernal Deity Kings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro met his gaze calmly and replied, "That's a secret of the Hudson family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian fell silent, a bit taken aback, realizing he'd pushed too far with his question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power the Hudson family was displaying left him feeling on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner, equally stunned, couldn't reconcile this with the intel he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he chose to congratulate Jethro instead, his demeanor much more friendly than Julian's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, God of Light interjected, "Excellent! With three hundred Supernal Deity Kings from the Jackson family, two hundred from the HeartUnited Alliance, two hundred from the Hudson family, and an additional three hundred Radiant Guardians from the Sanctum of Light, we'll have a force of one thousand Supernal Deity Kings protecting the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On top of that, I will personally stand guard. With such power, even if the Eight Dark Sovereigns come in full force, they won't stand a chance against us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Osborne, the God of Light asked, "With this many Supernal Deity Kings on your side, you can breathe a little easier, can't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled somewhat lightly and clasped his hands together. "Thank you, esteemed God of Light! And thanks to you too, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Cullen! Knowing you'll protect us puts my mind at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, just thinking about the Eight Dark Sovereigns potentially coming after us would make it hard to sleep. We'd have to keep one eye open all night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I really appreciate all your help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner nodded with a grin. "You can count on us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go set up the defenses and make sure nothing goes wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tanner hurried away to start preparations, while Julian left silently, his displeasure evident but unspoken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro exchanged nods with Osborne before turning to leave as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, why are you orchestrating all this? You still haven't revealed your full plan, and it leaves me feeling unsettled," God of Light remarked, her brow knitted together with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile was measured, and he replied, "Don't rush. You'll know my plans soon enough! Besides, you might find an intriguing spectacle unfolding and be quite surprised..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne dismissed the puzzled look from God of Light, his eyes glinting with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Now, all that's left is to wait for the Eight Dark Sovereigns to make their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hope they won't let me down... This time, the Paramount Supreme Clan </span><span>ha</span><span>s to feel the pain!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
