  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can comprehend it myself. It's no big deal. As long as I have a direction to move forward, I believe I can do it," Osborne said with confidence in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shrugged and said, "Actually, you don't need to be too obsessed. You haven't even broken through to Empyrean Sacredness, yet you already have such strength&mdash;it's truly outrageous. Even in the depths of the cosmos, there aren't many as extraordinary as you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If those geniuses from the Sacred Dragon Clan and Sacred Tiger Clan were at the same cultivation level as you, they most likely wouldn't be your match. So, I think you should just rest well and quietly wait for your cultivation level to break through to Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, your strength will naturally continue to improve. If your cultivation level can't break through, it will be very difficult to further enhance your power. Why push yourself so hard?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Yes, I've almost reached the limit below Empyrean Sacredness. Breaking through the limit is too difficult. Even if I try, I might not succeed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as I quietly wait for my cultivation level to break through to Empyrean Sacredness, these limits will immediately disappear. In that case, I can quickly enhance my strength again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rather than exhausting myself, I might as well take a good rest. After all, it will only take about half a year at most."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne ultimately shook his head and dismissed the thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted revenge. His enemy was incredibly powerful, arguably the most supreme and formidable being on Racial Convergence Planet, someone even Adriana couldn't afford to offend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's current strength is far from enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before seeking revenge, how could he dare to rest? How could he deserve to rest? Even if it meant improving just a little, he would keep pushing forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said seriously, "When I become the strongest in the cosmos, I'll take a good rest. But for now, I can't rest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've already found the direction to keep improving my strength. Next, I just need to keep working hard. As for whether I succeed or not, that depends on fate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne prepared to continue his training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial looked at Osborne somewhat helplessly and said, "Don't rush. I still have something to say. If you want to break through your elemental essence to the Sacredness Level, there is something that might help you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Primordial in surprise. "What?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said seriously, "The Elven Sacred Water from the Elven Mother Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Originally, I wanted to trick you into giving me the Elven Sacred Water from the Elven Mother Tree. But since you're so determined to improve your strength, I won't covet the Elven Sacred Water anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Elven Sacred Water can enhance your perception, allowing you to enter the Enlightenment State."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After entering the Enlightenment State, your perception will greatly improve. Moreover, you'll better comprehend this world. The key to breaking through elemental essence to Empyrean Sacredness lies in World Insights."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, with the help of the Elven Sacred Water, combined with your already strong perception, you might actually be able to break through one or two elemental essences to the Sacredness Level before your cultivation level reaches Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly became excited. "Does the Elven Sacred Water really have such effects? I asked you before, but you told me you didn't know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial awkwardly smiled and said, "That's because I wanted to trick you into giving me the Elven Sacred Water. If I had told you the true effects of the Elven Sacred Water, would you still have been willing to give it to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave Primordial a fierce glare. "At least you still have a conscience. Don't worry. The stronger I get, the more I can help you when we encounter other World Tree offshoots in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne entered his room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Use the Elven Sacred Water sparingly. Just one drop each time will do," </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> voice came from behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had already sat down and started a new round of training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "There's still over a month until the zone duel. With a hundredfold time acceleration, over a month equals more than eight years. I hope that in these eight years, I can push the elemental essences of spatial power, dark power, Thunder Power, and fire power from the highest Ascension Ten to the Sacredness Level. Fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne resolutely took out a transparent bottle containing the Elven Sacred Water from the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was given to him by Uriah.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne previously didn't know the effects of the Elven Sacred Water and didn't dare to use it lightly. After all, he only had a small bottle and couldn't afford to waste it. He even </span><span>thought</span><span> Uriah was a bit stingy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Elven Mother Tree is so enormous, yet Uriah only gave him such a small bottle of Elven Sacred Water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that he knows the effects of the Elven Sacred Water, Osborne understands its value and no longer thinks Uriah is stingy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Elven Sacred Water is truly a treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne no longer hesitated, took out a drop of Elven Sacred Water, and swallowed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt his mind become incredibly clear. His soul seemed to leave his body, rising up, soaring into the sky, then out of the Racial Convergence Planet, and even </span><span>into the depths of the cosmos. Through an immensely vast perspective, he quietly observed the cosmos, watching everything in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew this was the Enlightenment State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this state, Osborne didn&rsquo;t need to think about anything and could instantly comprehend more of the world's and the cosmos's rules.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, he suddenly returned to normal, his soul reentering his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt like only a few minutes had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after asking Primordial, he learned that he had been in the Enlightenment State for a month.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left Osborne utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what surprised him even more was that the elemental essences of his spatial power, dark power, Thunder Power, and fire power had all significantly improved. Although they were still far from breaking through to the Sacredness Level, he could clearly feel their progress.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only these four elemental essences, but the earth elemental, wind elemental, water elemental, and light elemental essences he had once mastered but not primarily cultivated also saw significant improvement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These elemental essences had all reached Ascension Eight. This filled Osborne with immense joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The effect of the Elven Sacred Water is even better than I expected. If I continue cultivating like this, the elemental essences of my spatial power, dark power, Thunder Power, and fire power will definitely reach the Sacredness Level. My other elemental essences can also reach the highest Ascension Ten."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't waste any time, </span><span>took</span><span> another drop of Elven Sacred Water, and entered the Enlightenment State again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne gained a different understanding of the world. When he woke up, another month had passed. His elemental essences had grown much stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Once again!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Once again!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Once again!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne kept using Elven Sacred Water to enter the Enlightenment State. He didn&rsquo;t notice it himself, but through repeated realizations, his aura gradually changed, becoming more in tune with the cosmos, even closer to perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body seemed to be undergoing an unknown transformation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
