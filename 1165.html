  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood frozen, the weight of Cain's words crashing down on him like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at the spectral figure, his mind racing. The Deity King who had stripped the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity from Cain, leaving him with nothing but a fractured soul&mdash;was none other than the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's teacher!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne couldn't help but think, "Well </span><span>done</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the God of Night hadn't severed the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity from Cain, the ancient vampire would still be alive and kicking, and Osborne would never have laid his hands on the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without that, he certainly wouldn't have a shot at the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Cain was a monster who deserved </span><span>to die</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Known as the God of Sin, his hands were stained with the blood of countless innocents. He had committed </span><span>numerous</span><span> atrocities</span><span> with his ability</span><span> </span><span>of being</span><span> immortal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone had to put him in his place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the satisfaction bubbling within him, Osborne kept his expression neutral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Cain seemed to have an uncanny ability to influence the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he tried to merge with it, any interference from Cain could spell disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After </span><span>thinking for </span><span>a moment, Osborne finally asked, "What exactly do you need my help with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's voice turned icy. "I want you to help me kill the God of Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw dropped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Kill the God of Night? Are you kidding me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he weren't Isa's teacher, his power as the mightiest Deity King is off the charts. How do you expect me to take him down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Osborne continued, "Cain, you're really asking a lot here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not even a god yet! What makes you think I can take out the God of Night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you do it yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain scoffed,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I could do it myself, would I be asking you? The God of Night may not have completely obliterated me, but he's done enough to my soul to make me a shadow of my former self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, I'm clinging to life thanks to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. If I step even a foot away from it, I'm as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And listen, I'm not asking you to avenge me right away. I just need your promise. If you agree, I'll do everything in my power to </span><span>help</span><span> you in claiming the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can sense a familiar power within you. If I'm not mistaken, you possess the Blood Cross, right? With the Blood Cross, you actually have a solid chance of merging with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You could become the new progenitor of the Blood Clan, achieving immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's only if you have my help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without it, your chances are at best </span><span>50%</span><span>. If I decide to make things difficult for you, well, you</span><span>r</span><span> </span><span>chances are 10% or none</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the gravity of Cain's words sink in. Cain continued, "So, </span><span>how about that</span><span>? Are you willing to help me take down the God of Night? I know you're not strong enough right now, but once you obtain the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, </span><span>your </span><span>upper limit will be endless</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You could become a Deity King, even surpassing the God of Night one day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is a Cosmic Treasure! Back in my day, I couldn't even harness a fraction of its power, yet I was already a Deity Overlord, second only to a Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can fully integrate with it, what's a Deity King to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face lit up with excitement at Cain's proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>answered eagerly, </span><span>"You're saying that all I have to do is agree to help you </span><span>take</span><span> your revenge, and you'll assist me in merging with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity? How can I trust you? What</span><span> if you didn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t follow your promise</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain scoffed. "You have my word. I won't interfere, I swear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You see, you're my last hope. This forsaken place, barren for </span><span>millions of ages</span><span>, has never welcomed a soul&mdash;until you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you fail, I'll be trapped here, waiting in lonely desolation. That's why I'll do everything </span><span>I can</span><span> to ensure your strength grows, ensuring you can take down the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And </span><span>you know what</span><span>? By then, you might even </span><span>able to</span><span> restor</span><span>e</span><span> my fragmented soul, allowing me to reclaim my body and freedom </span><span>again</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, no matter how you look at it, we're natural allies! I can help you grow stronger quickly, and in return, you can help me take my revenge and give me my freedom..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's words were </span><span>full of</span><span> temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing grew erratic, his eyes reddening&mdash;though it was merely a facade. Deep down, his mind remained </span><span>extremely calm</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't, and wouldn't, ever consider killing the God of Night, no matter how powerful he became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne did need Cain's help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne feigned an intense hunger for power, exclaiming, "Alright then! I, Owen, swear by my very life! If you aid me in obtaining the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I pledge to annihilate the God of Night on your behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And afterward, I shall do all within my means to restore your body and grant you the freedom you </span><span>want</span><span>!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
