  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Blue Planet is the place that survived after that war of the gods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded, her expression serious. "The Age of Gods was vast! Celestara, the world of the gods, was at least a hundred times bigger than Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But after the battle with Lord Malevolence, Celestara was tainted by a terrible scent of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of the scent of death, life couldn't thrive there. So, the God of Space sacrificed himself, splitting Celestara in two. One half was sealed away to suppress Lord Malevolence in a dimensional realm, while the other half became what we now know as Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks to the efforts of the Seven Deity Kings, Blue Planet has begun to flourish again. In the accelerated flow of time, life emerged once more, and so did metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night and the God of Light have been watching over Blue Planet, keeping an eye on the polluted Celestara and monitoring the situation with the imprisoned Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They discovered that Lord Malevolence is slowly recovering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the tainted Celestara is giving rise to powerful evil creatures," Isa added, her eyes widening with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "If Lord Malevolence and these evil beings break free from their Dimensional Space, this newly revived haven will once again become a land of death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone will perish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There won't be a single soul left to escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa clenched her fists, her expression grave and filled with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he might have dismissed Isa's stories as mere myths, but now the sincerity in her voice made him reconsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had encountered a Dark Deity himself&mdash;Mosley, the one sealed in the Augustine family dungeon&mdash;and the remnants of the God of Star in a spectral state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now understood that gods and deities were not just figments of imagination; they were real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If gods existed, then perhaps what Isa was saying was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one question nagged at him. How did she know all of this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Star might know about those things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed his gaze on Isa, a mix of curiosity and concern in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Isa composed herself. "Osborne, I can tell you're wondering why I know all this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded vigorously, eager for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint smile, Isa said, "It's because I am... the disciple of the God of Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief. "You're a disciple of the God of Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Deity Kings had sacrificed themselves to suppress Lord Malevolence and restore life to the Blue Planet, leaving only the God of Night and the God of Light to protect the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here was Isa, claiming to be a disciple of the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped, finally understanding the source of her incredible power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued, "Much of what I've told you comes from my teacher, but I've also seen things with my own eyes. For instance, those evil creatures in the sealed Celestara. I've been taken to see them by my teacher!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, her expression growing more serious. "There are countless evil beings, and even the weakest among them is comparable to a Class A metahuman. Most are on par with Class S Lesser Gods, or even stronger. If they were to emerge, Blue Planet would face instant annihilation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of dread wash over him. "So what do we do? You said Lord Malevolence is waking up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded gravely. "Yes. My teacher and the God of Light have entered Celestara, hoping to re-imprison and suppress Lord Malevolence. But their chances of success are slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before he left, my teacher gave me a mission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What mission?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, "To find the reincarnated forms of the five Deity Kings: the God of Death, the God of Life, the God of Space, the God of Time, and the God of Destiny."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's words hit Osborne like a cold wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean those five Deity Kings aren't truly dead? They've just been reborn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded firmly. "Exactly! They are Deity Kings, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could they really die? They burned their Divine Bodies and Divine Souls; their rebirth won't bring them back to their peak strength. Their powers and memories will awaken slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But to suppress Lord Malevolence and seal Celestara completely, preventing the emergence of evil creatures, we absolutely need to locate their reincarnations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can feel the God of Time awakening. But it's troubling because she's the last one who should be waking up first. If her powers regain a certain level, the time acceleration on Blue Planet will stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then those sealed Dark Deities will break free and regain their strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa bit her lip, determination hardening her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "That's why I must find the God of Time as quickly as possible. She needs to control the flow of time and delay the revival of the Dark Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to go!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
