  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s words brought Wesley back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did Wesley remember that Osborne had sent a total of seven pieces of uncut diamonds for cutting. Six of them had already been cut. The largest one was about to be cut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unlike the previous six pieces of cheap uncut diamonds, the price of the last piece was as high as five million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley said, &ldquo;Osborne, do you really think you can be lucky all the time? I don&rsquo;t believe that this uncut diamond has top-quality diamond.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne laughed, &ldquo;Does it matter whether you believe it or not? What&rsquo;s important is that I think this piece has the top-quality diamond. Let&rsquo;s take another bet.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley frowned immediately. He looked hesitant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he still said coldly, &ldquo;What do you want to bet? Do you want to bet on those top-quality diamonds? You are a waste. Can you make the decision?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he looked at Osborne with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled faintly, &ldquo;Of course I can make the decision. The question is what do you have to bet with me? Don&rsquo;t say that I look down on you. Even if you are the heir of the Ashford family, you can&rsquo;t come up with an equal bet.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After he finished speaking, Alison nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The six pieces of uncut diamonds selected by Osborne were all cut into top-quality diamonds. At this time, Alison had complete trust in Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Osborne wanted to have a bet with Wesley, Alison would not try to persuade him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What&rsquo;s more, Osborne was the boss. It was useless for Alison to persuade him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison just sneered and said, &ldquo;Wesley, Osborne can indeed make the decision. However, the raw materials of our top-grade diamond are worth at least 300 million dollars. Can you afford the bet?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Wesley heard this, he was angry at first. Then his eyes lit up. He felt excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As long as he could win the bet, he could get top-quality diamonds. The most important thing was that he was very familiar with the uncut diamond Osborne chose. All the experts in the Ashford family had seen it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The conclusions they reached were highly consistent. There was absolutely no way that piece of uncut diamond could produce top-grade diamonds, not even medium-quality diamonds. That was a piece of junk. As long as Osborne is willing to bet with Wesley, he was sure that he could win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But what could he use to bet with Osborne? Even if he was the heir of the Ashford family, he couldn&rsquo;t take out something worth three hundred million dollars. But he didn&rsquo;t want to miss this opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley said coldly, &ldquo;If you have the guts, just wait a moment. I will contact The Wise Order immediately.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shrugged. &ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley left to make a phone call. Not long after, he came back happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, The Wise Order has agreed. The Ashford family is willing to use Stelladite as a wager. Stelladite has just started mining. Its value is definitely more than 300 million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After he finished speaking, Alison was shocked. &ldquo;Stelladite? Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She whispered to Osborne, &ldquo;Mr. Augustine, I know Stelladite. It is one of the largest diamond mines in Skyefall. It is indeed worth more than 300 million dollars. If we can get Stelladite, there will be no shortage of raw materials in the future.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sneered in his heart but pretended to regret it. &ldquo;Wesley, are you sure you really want to bet with me? Maybe you should think about it again.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley said disdainfully, &ldquo;Stop talking nonsense. Are you afraid to lose?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne pretended to be unable to bear the humiliation and said anxiously, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sign the contract now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, Alison signed a contract with the Ashford family on behalf of Luna Jewelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If the last piece of the uncut diamond didn&rsquo;t cut out top-grade diamonds worth more than 50 million dollars, the Ashford family would win the bet. The previous diamonds would all belong to the Ashford family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If a top-quality diamond with a value of over 50 million dollars were cut out, Luna Jewelry would win the bet. The Ashford family would transfer Stelladite to Luna Jewelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the contract was notarized, the last cutting machine also stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The last piece of uncut diamond was finally cut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this point, this bet worth more than 300 million dollars was finally going to have a winner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley seemed extremely confident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley pondered, <span style="font-style: italic;">The reason why The Wise Order agreed to this bet was because even they </span><span style="font-style: italic;">was</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> certain that it was impossible to cut into top-grade diamonds from that piece. The entire diamond dealing market couldn&rsquo;t find top-quality diamonds worth more than 50 million dollars. We won&rsquo;t lose.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley sneered, &ldquo;Just open it. Osborne, you are too proud. You cut out 300 million top-grade diamond, but you are still not satisfied. You dare to bet with me. Soon, all the top-quality diamonds you cut will be mine. I hope you won&rsquo;t be so angry. I hope Alison can forgive you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne stopped pretending and sneered, &ldquo;Really? Wesley, you are so forgetful. You&rsquo;ve suffered so many losses from me. You still dare to bet with me? I&rsquo;m going to beat you up thoroughly this time. Open it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Osborne finished speaking, Alison, who had been impatient for a long time, immediately opened the cover of the cutting machine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next second, everyone saw a bright light.</p><div class="pagination">
