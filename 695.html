  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked solemn. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a conspiracy against him and Clarissa. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> even request</span><span>ed that they</span><span> get to Dragon Scale Island in three hours based on Osborne's speed of interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they set out now, they could barely reach Dragon Scale Island in three hours, which was several hundred miles away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the interdimensional travel would consume a lot of mental strength so Osborne would not be able to maintain his peak state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, they had no way to make more preparations, let alone summon more helpers to hurry there with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that it would be very dangerous for them to go there alone unprepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But looking at Clarissa's pale face, Osborne bit his lip and held her hand. "Let's go straight over there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> have set a trap for us, I will definitely help you rescue them! Besides, Barlyn is my buddy, and I will not give up on him.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa trembled when she heard this, biting her lip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, thank you! It's not your fault. You have warned them and told them to leave, but they refused. Thank you for risking your life to help me save them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne held her hand tightly and said, "Silly girl, don't mention it. You also risked your life to help me. Let's go and rescue them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afte</span><span>r saying that, Osborne was about to tear the space apart and h</span><span>urry to Dragon Scale Island immediately. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, his cell phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a look and found that it was Emma calling. He raised his eyebrows and answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I heard that you are in big trouble. What's going on? Do you need my help?" Emma said in a crisp voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. "How did you know? And why do you want to help me? We aren't friends, are we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smiled faintly. "We will be friends after I help you! I learned it from my information network. They found that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> attacked the Radcliffe family and </span><span>took away several people as hostages."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I got the news, it was too late. But I guess they took away several people as hostages to threaten you and the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family. </span><span>So</span><span> I hurried over. Do you need my help?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment, frowned, and asked, "I do need help, but can you come in handy? Can you fight AAA-class masters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Emma was a little annoyed and said, "What? Are you looking down on me? AAA-class masters are not strong opponents to me. I can deal with two or three of them easily! Don't forget that I have the swallow shield! You'll be safer with me around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was pleasantly surprised when he heard this. He almost forgot that Emma had the swallow shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swallow shield was a divine artifact with incredible defensive capabilities. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could also absorb the enemy's attacks and convert them into its power. Even among divine artifacts, it was top-notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately said, "I'm sorry. I'm not looking down on you but just worried that it will be too dangerous for you to join us. Since you have the swallow shield, I'm relieved. Nevertheless, what do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smiled faintly. "Nothing! I just believe that joining you will make it easier for me to get points! Matthew's and Owen's scores increase quickly. If I don't think of a way, I have no confidence in staying in the top two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, if I help you this time, I hope you can promise me that even if you win first place, you won't choose the swallow shield! I like it very much and want to keep it.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt relieved when he heard this. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already decide</span><span>d that even if he won first place, he would insist on choosing the scythe of </span><span>the Goddess of Grain over the swallow shield that seemed more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's request would not cause him any loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied, "Okay, I agree! If I win first place, I will choose the scythe of the Goddess of Grain over your swallow shield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great, then come pick me up!" Emma sent Osborne her location, which was only 200 miles away from him. It would take only two interdimensional travels to get there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped hesitating, tore open the dimensional rift, took Clarissa's hand, and walked in. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one minute later, they found Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma stood on a flat hilltop, smiling the moment she saw Osborne and Clarissa suddenly appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes fell on Clarissa's face. "The </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family is ravishing! Osborne, you are lucky to have such a girlfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, worried about her relatives at this time, just forced a smile and said, "Emma, you are also pretty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand. "Well, let's not waste time! The enemy is o</span><span>n Dragon Scale Island</span><span>. We must hurry there as soon as possible." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he tore open the dimensional rift again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, looked at Emma, and said, "Emma, I have to hold your hand to take interdimensional travels. Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smiled faintly and stretched out her hand. "As long as your girlfriend has no issues with it, that's fine with me."</span></p><div class="pagination">
