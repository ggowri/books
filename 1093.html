  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, every Eityreia Organization assassin was scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already taken down Sin, and the group of over ten assassins who rushed to help had all been slain, except for two Class S killers, who barely escaped with their lives in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Osborne, their hearts gripped with fear. They wondered if Osborne was still human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!" They had to flee and fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, every assassin from the Eityreia Organization turned and bolted desperately into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to escape? Do you think you'll get away?" Osborne snorted, his eyes brimming with murderous intent. "Weren't you enjoying yourselves when you tried to assassinate the Augustine family? And now you think you can just leave? Life's not that simple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave your lives behind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne roared, "Blood Demon, heed my order!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than 4,800 Blood Demon members responded excitedly, "Here!" The moment Osborne appeared, they were already eager for battle, held back only because they had to guard their posts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that Osborne called on them, everyone shouted back, faces alight with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Work with me. Let's wipe them all out!" Osborne's right eye, glowing with the power of Medusa's Gaze, flared even brighter. Wherever the light swept, everything turned to stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed the positions of the fleeing Eityreia Organization assassins, and with one powerful sweep, the light petrified them, freezing each Class S killer in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, the Blood Demon members struck. They unleashed a barrage of attacks. Thousands of energy guns, even super energy guns, along with power strikes, rained down on the assassins frozen by Osborne's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each individual attack might not have been enough to break through the defense of a Class S warrior, but dozens, hundreds, even thousands of attacks all at once? Not even a top-tier Class S could withstand such a relentless onslaught, let alone a regular one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to make matters worse, their bodies were petrified, leaving them utterly defenseless, with no chance to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under these circumstances, the petrified Class S assassins from the Eityreia Organization were swiftly dispatched by the Blood Demon members, their bodies exploding into countless pieces of flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the more seasoned Class S warriors were slowed down by Osborne's petrifying power, making them easy targets. Before long, they too met the same fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield thundered with destruction as Osborne locked onto assassin after assassin, turning them to stone, only for the Blood Demon members to unleash a torrent of attacks that obliterated their frozen forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was true carnage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of this massacre far outstripped even Osborne's own hand when he used his Goddess of Grain's scythe to decapitate enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, countless Class S assassins were identified, petrified, and wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though these assassins were fast and their Stealth Arts formidable, it was all in vain before Osborne. As long as they couldn't outrun his gaze, they were doomed to be turned to stone and then killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, even the Augustine family members joined the fray. Their attacks surged forward, targeting the petrified assassins with fervor, their combined efforts blasting the assassins' bodies apart in a storm of flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Augustine family, it was a moment of sheer catharsis. These same assassins had once hunted them down, filling them with terror and hopelessness. But now, the tables had turned. It was their chance to strike back, to make the Class S assassins feel the same fear and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slaughter only intensified from there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Medusa's Gaze was at full power, hunting down the fleeing Eityreia Organization assassins one by one, turning them into statues, waiting for the inevitable slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sixty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seventy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, nearly all the assassins had been rooted out, petrified in place, and swiftly executed by the combined forces of Blood Demon and the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only two managed to escape. The two top-tier Class S assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne's petrification power affected them, it wasn't enough to fully stop their desperate flight. They were already nearing the canyon's edge, almost tasting freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne locked his eyes on their retreating figures and sneered, "I told you, every last one of the Eityreia Organization assassins will die here today. That includes both of you. You're not getting away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Osborne vanished, using interdimensional travel. Instantly, he reappeared before the two fleeing assassins, blocking their escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces went pale, consumed by terror. "Osborne, are you really going to wipe us out? Do you truly want to make the Eityreia Organization your eternal enemy? This is suicide! No one who crosses them has ever lived to tell the tale!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So let us go. We're part of the inner circle. We can help resolve this. If you spare us, the Eityreia Organization won't come after you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered at their words. "Let you go, and the Eityreia Organization will just leave me alone? Do you even believe that yourselves? Enough talk! Just die!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
