  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, is </span><span>Anastasia</span><span> okay?" Zoe asked, her voice laced with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel the surging energy radiating from Anastasia. It had far exceeded her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, she had to keep her distance, standing a good ten feet away, knowing any closer would provoke a potentially dangerous reaction from Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy was so volatile that even Zoe, Anastasia's twin, couldn't approach without risking an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that Anastasia hadn't fully regained her consciousness yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was serious as he observed the rapid increase in Anastasia's energy levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rising speed was alarming; this wasn't normal by any means. Even more concerning was the fact that there seemed to be no limit to it. It was as if a fountain of energy had awakened within her, continuously overflowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, she would break through to Class AAA in less than one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for Anastasia to truly awaken, that energy would need to stabilize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was unsure of what would happen next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would this be a blessing or a curse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the weight of Zoe's worry, he did his best to reassure her, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Zoe. Anastasia will be fine! She's special, and this energy surge is probably a good thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows, maybe she would wake up as a Class AAA warrior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe exhaled, relief washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought that Anastasia could wake up with Class AAA prowess left her in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "I've been training for months with a top-notch teacher like Isa, and I'm only at Class A. There's still a long way to go before I hit Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here's Anastasia, just sleeping, and she might skip right to that level. It's mind-blowing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't feel any jealousy&mdash;after all, Anastasia was her sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Anastasia had been gravely ill for so long, on the brink of death if not for Osborne's determination to save her, filled Zoe's heart with gratitude rather than envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that her sister's health was finally restored, any transformations Anastasia underwent were more than welcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe fixed her gaze on Anastasia's face, silently praying for her sister to wake up sound and safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shared her prayers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, all that mattered was that Anastasia opened her eyes again; he didn't care about her strength, only that she was healthy and whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time slowly ticked by, the energy radiating from Anastasia remained unrelenting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, after a day, her energy surged past Class AAA, and showed no signs of slowing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's utter shock, he realized that the energy around her was now pushing past into Class S level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I thought for sure that once she hit Class AAA, the energy would stabilize, and she'd wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Class AAA isn't even her limit?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is Anastasia really going to leap directly to Class S?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worry began to gnaw at Osborne as the reality of the situation settled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia is just an ordinary girl! She's never trained a day in her life and hardly even knows what training means. And now she's suddenly flooded with an overwhelming energy comparable to Class S? Can she even handle this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this energy goes haywire, she could be in serious danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's like handing a little kid a powerful machine gun&mdash;there's no way they might control it, and they could very well end up hurting themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Class S energy swirling around in her, if Anastasia can't control it, it could explode like a bomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of anxiety pressed down on him. He felt utterly helpless; there was no way to halt the escalating energy within Anastasia, nor could he wake her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I going to do?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an idea crossed his mind&mdash;Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe she's the only one who can help! But Isa isn't here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip in frustration, worry coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hastily dialed Isa's number only to find it unreachable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic started creeping in as he recalled what Isa had told him during her first departure, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you ever find yourself in a bind, just call my name, and I'll show up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he hadn't taken it seriously; it seemed too far-fetched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, when Isa materialized to rescue him in </span><span>Tethynia</span><span>, she had reiterated those very words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe now was the moment to give it a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can calling Isa's name actually reach her? Is this some sort of power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head; there was no time to overthink it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever happens, I need to try! Isa's the only one I can think of! She's my last resort!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his jaw, he raised his head to the heavens and began to call out, "Isa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa! Isa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cried her name over and over, a dozen times at least, yet all he received in return was silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wry smile settling on his face, Osborne muttered, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really getting myself worked up here. How could I expect Isa to hear me from thousands of miles away? She's not a god!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he turned to head back, he was abruptly stopped in his tracks by the sight of a stunningly beautiful girl appearing just inches from him, an enigmatic smile dancing on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Isa!</span></p><div class="pagination">
