They had lost all eight matches today, a far worse outcome than the Human Community's performance over the past two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the agreement, they had to retreat five million miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion was utterly dejected, their morale at rock bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's matches had been a complete disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had they lost all eight matches, but several of them had been outright massacres. Not a single person who stepped onto the arena had survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their losses today were devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength displayed by the elite geniuses of the Sanctum of Light, the warriors of the Hudson family, the Blood Demon members, and the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings left them feeling hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Light is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheers from the Human Alliance only added to their despair. Every soldier hung their head low, quickly retreating without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Human Alliance was in a frenzy, shouting the names of Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, they were the heroes of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before today's matches, the Human Alliance's morale had hit rock bottom. Two consecutive days of one win and seven losses had left them almost hopeless. Many had seriously begun to wonder if the Human Community was truly inferior to the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the Paramount Supreme Clan truly superior to the Human Community?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even thought it would be better for the Human Community to surrender to the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least that way, fewer lives would be lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they resist when the gap was so vast?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in a fair arena, with equal numbers and cultivation levels, the Human Community couldn't defeat the Paramount Supreme Clan. In an all-out war, facing a Dark Deity Legion at least five times their size, wouldn't they be doomed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, before today's matches, many had almost given up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, everything was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's matches were like a powerful shot of adrenaline for them! Their fallen morale had been completely restored. They were more confident and proud than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the Human Community had thoroughly beaten the Paramount Supreme Clan in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the Blood Demon members and the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Paramount Supreme Clan faced them in the arena, the only outcome was a slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings had even killed ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, a hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, and a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What an incredible achievement!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community and the Dark Deity Legion had been clashing at the border for so many years. Still, they had never achieved such a decisive victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not be excited?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not see the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings as heroes and idols?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheers lasted for a long, long time. Even after Osborne and the others returned to the Sanctum of Light, they could still clearly hear the cheers outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light personally came to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light smiled and said, "From today onward, the eight of you are the heroes of the entire Human Community! The pride of the Human Community! If you're willing, all you need to do is raise your arms, and countless members of the Human Community will follow you. If you're willing, the Demon Slayer will soon become the strongest Dukedom-Level Power in the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps even a Sanctum-Level force in the near future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, congratulations! And thank you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without you, I truly wouldn't know what to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light spoke sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Human Community leaders beside her also looked at them with awe, gratitude, and envy. Many of them felt deeply ashamed because they hadn't believed in Osborne and the others' strength before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they were convinced!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne and the others who had given them hope, who had given the Human Community hope. Every member of the Human Community who had witnessed the matches could now hold their heads high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, there's no need to be so polite. This is what we should do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, today's matches are over! The Dark Deity Legion will retreat five million miles, and our defense line can advance five million miles as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peaks City is safe for now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, everyone, get to work. Quickly advance the defense line and prepare for tomorrow's matches!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded, feeling both happy and motivated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, wait a moment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light called out to Osborne and the others. Now, only they remained in the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, do you have any instructions?" Osborne asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light looked at him and said, "Osborne, let's talk about tomorrow's matches."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow's matches?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still confused. "We can just follow today's arrangement!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said seriously, "Osborne, do you think the Paramount Supreme Clan, having suffered such a crushing defeat today, will just sit back and do nothing? What do you think they'll do to turn the tide of the matches?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled confidently and said, "No matter what they do, they won't be able to turn the tide! Unless they stop participating in the matches altogether! However, their goal is Peaks City. They want to use the matches to take Peaks City, a strategic stronghold, with minimal losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, as long as there's hope, they won't give up on the matches and choose to start an all-out war. If they do that, they'll have to pay a heavy price to take Peaks City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished, the God of Light nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. Icy One's target is Peaks City! Peaks City is easy to defend and hard to attack. Even if their Dark Deity Legion is five times our size and stronger than us, they'd have to pay a heavy price to break through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's a chance to take Peaks City through the matches, Icy One won't give up easily! But what if there's no hope at all? The strength you've displayed is too overwhelming. Continuing the matches would just be sending their people to their deaths!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Icy One is that stupid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, God of Light, you think Icy One will abandon the matches and launch an all-out war?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light shook her head again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! That's not it! As I said, that's only if there's absolutely no hope. What Icy One is more likely to do is...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find a way to kill you! To prevent you from participating in the matches! If you die, we won't win a single match in the Ascension One, Ascension Two, Ascension Three, or Ascension Four categories!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One will definitely try to assassinate you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
