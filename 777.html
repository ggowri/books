  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's body shook as the possibility crossed his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt it was very likely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this world, if there was one person Osborne couldn't fully figure out, it had to be Isa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa had said she was Class AAA, but that was two months ago. She might have left during this time to break through to Class S!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought that Isa might have reached Class S left Osborne feeling both happy for her and a little frustrated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought I was finally catching up to her in strength! If she reaches Class S, when will I ever be able to defeat her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She did say I'd only get to do whatever I want with her if I beat her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed helplessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Isa breaking through to Class S was just Osborne's guess. It wasn't necessarily true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's on your mind, Osborne?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron suddenly asked, "You've been staring at the Godson Rankings for a while, especially the top ten. Don't tell me you're aiming for the top ten?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snapped out of his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled calmly and replied, "A soldier who doesn't want to be a general is no good! I'm far from the top ten right now, but who knows what the future holds?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron was momentarily stunned by this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, nodding seriously, Ron said, "You're right. People need goals! My goal used to be to get into the top hundreds of the Godson Rankings. But now, I'm learning from you. My goal is the top ten, too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, Ron's eyes filled with fighting spirit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled slightly and asked, "Ron, are you familiar with the Godson Rankings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron puffed out his chest and replied proudly, "Of course! I can't recite them backward, but I know every name on the list!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly asked, "Do you know Isa?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wasn't she ranked high on the Godson Rankings before disappearing recently?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron paused, confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa? Who's that? Never heard of her. No one by that name has ever been on the Godson Rankings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was surprised. "Are you sure?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm absolutely sure!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron's expression was serious. "At least in the last ten years, there's never been anyone named Isa on the list!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about the Night Witch?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the Godson Rankings allowed the use of aliases, Osborne thought Isa might have used the alias&nbsp;Night Witch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Night Witch?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron froze again. "Sounds vaguely familiar, but I can guarantee there's never been a&nbsp;Night Witch&nbsp;on the Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was completely baffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was no one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This confused Osborne deeply. With Isa's strength, how could she not be on the Godson Rankings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It made no sense!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could Isa have been hiding her true strength from me all this time? Is she already an S-Class Supreme Overlord?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't know that. While he was asking Ron about Isa, far off the coast of Tethynia, Isa herself suddenly paused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne...why is he saying my name?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me see!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing atop a wave, Isa waved her hand, and a scene appeared before her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the scene, Osborne stared at the Godson Rankings, frowning deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It makes no sense. Isa is so strong. How could she not be on the list? Could she really have been hiding her strength from me? Is she already an S-Class Supreme Overlord?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When will I ever be able to beat her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When will I be able to pin her down and do whatever I want with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked frustrated, clearly bothered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa, as if hearing his thoughts, blushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This brat, what is he even thinking?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But, he's in Tethynia too? I've been following the Goddess of Time's energy. He came before me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, since we're both here, I might as well go check out the show!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, right. He's starting to doubt my strength. I need to do something about that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Muttering to herself, Isa suddenly vanished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next second, she appeared atop a towering snow-covered mountain, where an old man was meditating in the icy winds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You old thing, still alive?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old man opened his eyes. Upon seeing Isa, a flash of excitement broke through his calm gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly bowed to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Greetings, Ms. Night. Thank you for your concern. I'm not dead just yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa smiled faintly. "Do me a favor. Put my name on the Godson Rankings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old man was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Aren't you the leader of the Diviner League? You created the Godson Rankings. Don't tell me you can't put my name there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's expression darkened slightly, carrying a hint of menace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old man jumped in fright and quickly replied, "Of course! Absolutely! Ms. Night, whatever you wish!"</p><div class="pagination">
