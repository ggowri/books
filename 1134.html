  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep worry flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While others might be puzzled about the origins of these Exotic Beasts, even speculating that they were merely the result of genetic mutations among ordinary wildlife, Osborne had a pretty good idea of what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Exotic Beasts bore a striking resemblance to the Dark Deity he had encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memory of that encounter was etched in his mind. He had killed a massive mosquito that was the embodiment of the Dark Deity in the dungeons of the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, furrowing his brow, "Make no mistake. These Exotic Beasts are definitely not Dark Deities. They're far too weak, and there's no way there could be this many of them. But they're undeniably connected to the Dark Deity. They're probably Dark Exotic Beasts under its command, orchestrating the Beast Tide to attack cities for a specific purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real question is, what do they want? I can't quite figure that out yet, but one </span><span>thing is clear: we cannot let them succeed! Even if it's just to protect the innocent from slaughter, we must do everything in our power to stop the Beast Tide and wipe out these Dark Exotic Beasts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the situation was precarious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the current attacks from the Beast Tide didn't seem overwhelmingly strong. Class S Dark Exotic Beasts were still relatively few. He understood the danger of complacency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of these Dark Exotic Beasts was on the rise, and each subsequent attack was more formidable than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of cities affected by the Beast Tide was increasing alarmingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a month ago, only ten cities in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> had faced the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, over 30 cities were under siege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains outside </span><span>Newport City were gathering a horde of ferocious beasts poised to unleash a mid-level Beast Tide. The severity of the situation was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought grimly, "If we don't find a solution soon, the so-called apocalypse might not be just a fantasy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll have to see for myself when the Beast Tide explodes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of determination, but he was also acutely aware of how little information he had and how uncertain the path forward was. Fortunately, the Augustine family had made significant strides in power over the past three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The abundant star power had infused Blue Planet with a massive amount of energy, rapidly boosting anyone who tapped into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three months ago, after the battle with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the Augustine family, along with Bryce, had only seven Class S experts: Osborne, Sebastian, Bryce, Wesson, Miranda, Fiona, and Ashley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, only Sebastian stood out as a top-tier Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, this didn't include the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family had fewer than 200 Class AAA warriors and just over 1,000 above Class A, including the strength from the Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in just three short months, the Augustine family had undergone a dramatic transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Class S experts had skyrocketed to over a hundred, and Class AAA experts had surged past a thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This didn't even account for the Blood Demon members, who had all broken through to Class S during that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his slumber, only 1,000 Blood Demon members had reached Class S, which had already been an incredibly formidable force capable of easily wiping out the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, every single member of the Blood Demon was Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he knew their potential was somewhat limited. Despite breaking through to Class S, very few could rise to the top tier like Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ultimately, we still need blood energy," Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The 48 hundred Blood Demon members were his greatest source of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that many Class S warriors at his disposal, he felt ready to take on even a rejuvenated Dark Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A typical Beast Tide wouldn't pose a threat to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian suddenly spoke up, "Osborne, now that you're awake, you can handle the affairs of the Augustine family and the Draco Group yourself. I'm getting old and don't want to meddle in these matters anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lately, a lot of Ancient Families and superpowers have been clamoring to buy our energy guns. I haven't decided whether to sell or not. You make the call now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>exclaimed, surprised, "Buy energy guns?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, you're not old at all! You can't just stop managing things now. I don't know anything; I still need your help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian chuckled. "Alright then, let Matthew assist you. He's quite capable and strong. I've reached a bottleneck and want to try a breakthrough to become... a deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like in the future, not becoming a deity might not even ensure self-preservation. I'm not young anymore; I can't afford to be distracted by other matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a thrill at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded quickly. "Alright then, I won't trouble you with these matters anymore! Just let me know what you need, and I'll make sure to get it for you. I'll discuss everything with Matthew regarding the Augustine family and the Draco Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded. "I trust you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he gave Osborne a firm pat on the shoulder and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matthew, fill me in on the energy gun situation," Osborne said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
