  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't rush, I haven't finished speaking yet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly grabbed Alfreda, feeling both amused and helpless. He immediately explained everything in detail.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your parents should be safe now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They have merged with the Elven Mother Tree, relying on its power. Isidore can't harm them for now. They said they could hold on for three years..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, not even a year has passed yet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, once I finish things here, I'll go back to Elf City with you, rescue your parents and your brother! Then completely deal with Isidore..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With my current strength, dealing with Isidore is no problem at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's words made Alfreda feel a bit more at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she still frowned tightly, biting her lip. "My parents and brother actually merged with the Elven Mother Tree? They're not suited for this at all! Forcing the fusion will definitely cause big problems..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't wait, I must go back immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda was extremely anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, hesitated. With his current strength, dealing with Isidore or even destroying the entire Elf City would be effortless, and rescuing Alfreda's parents and brother would be a piece of cake. But no matter how simple, this matter would still take quite some time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he simply didn't have extra time right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick was hunting them everywhere. Even though this secret base was protected by a formation that could conceal their presence, they had at most five or six days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In five or six days, their location would inevitably be exposed, and by then Frederick would bring people to surround this place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne must prepare in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he couldn't go back to Elf City with Alfreda right now. At the very least, he had to deal with Frederick's threat first before heading to Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alfreda was very worried about her parents and brother, and she insisted on returning to Elf City immediately. Osborne couldn't stop her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "How about this, we split up. I'll find someone to go back to Elf City with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew that with her current cultivation level of Ascension Four Supernal Deity King Level, even if she returned to Elf City, she couldn't do anything. Not only would she fail to save her parents and brother, but she might also get captured by Isidore and be used to threaten her family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne could find someone to accompany her back to Elf City, that would be great.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne began to think about who to send to accompany Alfreda back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's eyes, the former Elf City was incredibly powerful, but now it seems its strength is only equivalent to a Second-rate Power on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the strongest in &trade;, Isidore, is merely at advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from him, there are only a dozen primary Empyrean Sacredness and mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a Second-rate Power could be easily wiped out with Osborne's current strength. If he wanted, he could destroy the entire Elf City with a single arrow, making it vanish forever into deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne thought of the right candidate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isa, go to Elf City with Alfreda! Alfreda's parents are in danger now, help her rescue them," Osborne said to Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa nodded without hesitation and walked over to hold Alfreda's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No problem, I can do it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa's cultivation level has now reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, and she can easily handle Isidore. Her strength is enough to overpower the entire Elf City and rescue Alfreda's parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana spoke, "I'll go with you too! I promise your parents will be absolutely fine! After all, we're family now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda was stunned and widened her eyes in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and explained, "You're Osborne's seventh girlfriend! By the way, Isa is the first, Clarissa is the second, Austin is the third, Emma is the fourth, Anita is the fifth, I'm the sixth, so now you're his seventh girlfriend."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished, Alfreda's face instantly turned as red as an apple, and she lowered her head, too shy to speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave Adriana a fierce glare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you glaring at me? I'm not wrong. That's just the truth!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana felt a bit defiant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, just shut up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa said helplessly, "Adriana, you can't go! You must stay here to keep improving your skills! It's enough for me to accompany her to Elf City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana wanted to say something, but Isa shot her a glare, so she had to stay quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clarissa spoke up, "I've been here for a while and feel a bit bored, so I just want to go out for a walk! Anyway, I'm an advanced Empyrean Sacredness, so I should be able to help."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Clarissa smiled at Isa and said, "Isa, is that okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa looked at Clarissa speechlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're messing around with Adriana too? What nonsense are you talking about! Everyone is equal!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think it's pretty fun!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa smiled and said, "Anyway, you'll be our leader from now on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, Emma, Austin, and Anita all laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all admired Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Isa was the youngest and not the strongest, nor had she been with Osborne the longest, they all listened to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa had a natural leadership aura. Adriana used to have it too, but ever since she got together with Osborne, she seemed like a different person&mdash;playful, like an immature child. That leadership aura had long vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was actually related to Adriana's romantic experiences.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was born in the Fairy Moon Sect on the Racial Convergence Planet, naturally powerful. She had never experienced romance and was even somewhat cold and unfeeling by nature.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this state, Adriana was calm, serious, and an excellent leader.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when she became interested in Osborne, gradually developed feelings, and eventually fell in love with him, everything changed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt "love" for the first time, her cold shell was broken, revealing her true self, and she became like a playful child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the real her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, despite her great strength, she had no desire to compete with Isa for authority and willingly followed Isa's arrangements.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa felt a bit helpless at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to dwell on the issue and said, &ldquo;Then let Isa and Clarissa accompany Alfreda to Elf City! Resolve the matters there as soon as possible! If anything unexpected happens, inform me immediately!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, no one objected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and said, "Isa, Clarissa, Alfreda, be careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave her a glare, then used spatial power to open a space rift leading directly to deep space, watching Isa and Clarissa protect Alfreda as they disappeared together into the space rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said to Adriana, "Adriana, hurry up and train to improve your strength! I need to start executing the plan too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Adriana didn't mess around. She nodded seriously and said, "Don't worry! Leave Frederick to me! I promise to give him a huge surprise when he comes looking!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take care too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana went back to continue her training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma, Austin, and Anita also reminded Osborne to be careful, then went to train.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After they left, Osborne's gaze turned icy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frederick, the hunt begins now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the words fell, Osborne's figure had already vanished from the spot.</span></p><div class="pagination">
