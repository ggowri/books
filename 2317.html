  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced down at the defeated Jared, a faint smirk on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being ranked twenty-eighth on the strength leaderboard, Jared was no match for Osborne these days. In Osborne's eyes, only the top ten contenders could put up a real fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the rest? They didn't stand a chance against his Sacred Power arrows, even if they had defensive Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the top ten didn't seem all that intimidating to him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he'd fused dark, spatial, and thunder powers, each a force to be reckoned with on its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unique blend had skyrocketed his Sacred Power to an otherworldly level, almost on par with some newly-promoted Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Bloodwrought Bow, which was like an extension of himself, Osborne could unleash its full might without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, even someone with a top-notch defensive Sacred Artifact would find it tough to block his attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only folks like Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson&mdash;who'd also fused three powers and had their own defensive Sacred Artifacts&mdash;might give him a moment's thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jared? He was a pushover!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne got a bit more serious, Jared simply couldn't hold up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Jared was out of the game, Osborne didn't waste a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drew back his Bloodwrought Bow again, channeling just a smidge of his Sacred Power to conjure three Sacred Power arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrows sliced through the air like lightning, hitting Clara and Leroy's opponents in the blink of an eye. Those three guys were no mugs, but without defensive Sacred Artifacts, they were as vulnerable as sitting ducks. No matter how they tried to put up a fight, it was all in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrows punched through their defenses, knocking them flying without a peep. They landed on the ground, out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield went deathly quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara and Leroy gawked at Osborne in disbelief, then at Jared and his beaten-up teammates. They were flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is this seriously happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's team was full of the top dogs from the Eight Great Academies, each with their own bag of tricks. Otherwise, Jared wouldn't have made it into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they'd been wiped out by Osborne like they were nothing but cardboard cutouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jared himself couldn't stand up to Osborne's arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara and Leroy couldn't help but think about what would have happened if they were in Jared's place&mdash;could they have withstood Osborne's Sacred Power arrows?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was scarier than he'd been during the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in Frost Peak City, Angela and Danilo stared at the projection in stunned silence as they watched Osborne take out Jared's whole team with ease. They were just as gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Frost Peak City erupted in a chaotic din of excitement. People were whooping, hollering, and gasping in disbelief all over the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela muttered as she tried to wrap her head around what she'd just witnessed, "Is that seriously Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has he stepped up his game? Or is Jared just all bark and no bite? He's ranked twenty-eighth, isn't he? How come he looked so pathetic, going down after just a few arrows from Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela still couldn't quite believe her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jared had cornered Clara and Leroy, she'd thought it was game over for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A twinge of pity had hit her; after all, they were from Tempest Fortress City, and she'd been rooting for them to do well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being surrounded by Jared's team had seemed like a one-way ticket to defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, they were bound to lose ten percent of their points to Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Osborne had showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, Angela couldn't fathom that Osborne's arrival could turn the tables. After all, Jared's ranking was way higher than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way Osborne could hold a candle to Jared, who was a whiz at using two Sacred Artifacts&mdash;one for attacking and one for defending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he had his strong teammates backing him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened next was like something out of a fairytale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swooped in and took out Jared's whole team without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was even smoother than his performance in the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Whoa! He has really upped his game! If I'm not wrong, he's merged three powers now. No wonder he took Jared down so effortlessly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit her like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly recalled that during the city duel, Osborne had only combined two powers. He'd even asked Adriana how to merge more when she visited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, just twenty days later, he'd managed to add a third power to the mix!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela thought, her excitement building.</span><br><span>What a prodigy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the whole state duel, only Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson had managed to merge three powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those four could have easily snagged the championship in previous state duels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it seemed Osborne had joined their league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he really can make a splash in the state duel!" Angela mumbled, her eyes shining with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, not too far away, the bigwigs from the Eight Great Academies had gathered to watch, and every single one of them had a gloomy look on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Azure Haven Academy, you owe us an explanation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ezra Monroe, the vice-president of Radiant Enigmas Academy, scowled at Maisie Holiday, the vice-president of Azure Haven Academy, as if he could pierce her with his angry glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vice-presidents of the other six academies chimed in, their glares intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the heat, Maisie took a deep breath and forced a wry smile. "What kind of answer are you after? What went down in the state duel was out of my hands! It's just the young folks settling their own beef."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Settling their own beef?" Ezra was fuming. "We, the Eight Great Academies, are in this together to snag a top-ten spot, and this is the crunch time. Jared was holding his ground in the top ten. All he needed was for Leroy to pass on some points, and he'd be set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no! Your Leroy said no! And not only that, she ganged up with others to take Jared down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, with Jared out of the fight, he's gonna lose ten percent of his points and fall out of the top ten! To make matters worse, they even hurt him! How's he supposed to go for more points? How's he supposed to fight for a top-ten spot?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of Leroy's double-crossing, we've all blown our shot at the top ten! Leroy is a turncoat to the Eight Great Academies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you pass it off as just a tiff among the young folks?" Ezra seethed, his anger practically tangible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other vice presidents jumped in, their voices rising in a chorus. "Mr. Ezra Monroe is spot-on! Ms. Maisie Holiday, Leroy has really dropped the ball!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's messed up our whole game plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks to her, we've blown our one and only chance at a top-ten finish! She's got to pay for this, and Azure Haven Academy is in the hot seat too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy needs to be given a serious punishment!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
