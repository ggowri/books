  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osric, are you okay? Are you hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine quickly appeared at Osric's side, propping him up and assessing his condition. He hurriedly produced a white Miracle Elixir and forced it into Osric's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the effect was feeble at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power had become so refined that any injuries he inflicted left traces of his energy behind. As a result, the efficacy of the white Miracle Elixir was suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osric, now significantly weakened, struggled to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to waste that on me, Icy Nine. I won't die. I can heal myself! But we have to get out of here fast! My soul power is heavily compromised, and I can't heal you right now. If we stick around any longer, we're in big trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was tinged with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Icy Nine frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he shouted, "Everyone, fall back! We have to retreat&mdash;now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osric's severe injuries made Icy Nine realize that their plan to wear down the Shadow Terror Fiend into submission was no longer feasible. The priority was to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But would the Shadow Terror Fiend allow that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolutely not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend roared with laughter, "Icy Nine, weren't you just full of bravado?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Suddenly looking to run, are we? You think I'll let you get away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll all die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, his power surged to a new level of madness. He struck out at the three Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings blocking his path, sending them flying and spitting blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of you must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend fully unleashed his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being restrained, the pent-up rage turned him into a relentless force of destruction, tearing into the Paramount Supreme Clan's elite warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, over a dozen Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan were left severely injured by the rampaging Shadow Terror Fiend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the chaos unfold, Icy Nine rushed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even he found himself unable to stand against the Shadow Terror Fiend now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, they managed to wear down the Shadow Terror Fiend partly due to Icy Nine's strength. As an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, he could engage the Shadow Terror Fiend on nearly equal footing&mdash;if only he had Osric's healing abilities to sustain him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others only served as support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Osric incapacitated, Icy Nine was no match for the Shadow Terror Fiend. He quickly found himself outmatched and injured, unable to receive any healing from Osric, which forced him to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the rest of the Paramount Supreme Clan warriors were met with devastating consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings couldn't withstand the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They crumbled under the relentless blows of the Shadow Terror Fiend. One Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, too slow to escape, was struck and exploded upon impact, his soul power dissipating into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the second, then the third.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Shadow Terror Fiend resembled a god of war, wreaking havoc among the more than fifty Supernal Deity Kings of the Paramount Supreme Clan as if they were mere targets, brutally injuring and even killing them with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine swallowed another white Miracle Elixir, managing to stabilize his condition slightly. Yet, the fiend's power remained overwhelmingly pure, rendering the effects of the elixir ineffective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't dwell on that any longer. Once again, he charged toward the Shadow Terror Fiend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors of the Paramount Supreme Clan were breaking apart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Icy Nine didn't act, they would all be slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here! I'll hold him off! Go! Quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Icy Nine shouted, the others fled in terror, desperate to distance themselves from the nightmarish Shadow Terror Fiend. They needed to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Nine, you can't even save yourself, yet you're worried about these worthless fools? If that's the case, you can stay here forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend unleashed a furious barrage, pushing Icy Nine back with relentless force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Icy Nine found himself severely injured, but rather than finishing him off, the Shadow Terror Fiend turned his attention elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spotted the weakened Osric, who was being carried away at speed by an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend sneered, saying, "Trying to run, are we?! It's because of you that I've been so frustrated until now! You annoying life power user&mdash;time for you to die permanently!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Shadow Terror Fiend vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine had no hope of stopping him and could only shout in desperation, "Watch out! Protect Osric! Don't let anything happen to him! Keep him safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine's frantic warnings were futile, as everything would soon prove to be a desperate struggle against overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Four Supernal Deity King from the Paramount Supreme Clan launched himself at the Shadow Terror Fiend, desperately attempting to intervene and save Osric, but with a single strike, the fiend sent him flying, inflicting yet another grievous wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Shadow Terror Fiend had his hands around Osric's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terror and despair in Osric's eyes were palpable as he cried out, "Don't kill me! Please! I surrender..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surrender?" The Shadow Terror Fiend laughed coldly. "I don't need weaklings like you! So, you irritating little pest, it's time for you to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden, brutal twist of his hand, the sound of cracking bones echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine's vision blurred with rage, and he screamed in anguish, but his screams fell on deaf ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osric's neck snapped under the Shadow Terror Fiend's grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy of the Shadow Terror Fiend surged violently into Osric's body, completely obliterating him from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how resilient Osric was, an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King and a life power wielder with exceptional vitality, there was no way to survive such devastation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osric's eyes dimmed, the flicker of life snuffed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend smirked, tossing Osric's lifeless body aside like a rag doll, his eyes still burning with a mad thirst for blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He growled, "Dare to take advantage of my moment of weakness? You damned ants will all die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the Shadow Terror Fiend sprang into action, mercilessly hunting down the fleeing warriors of the Paramount Supreme Clan, picking them off one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine watched, fury and helplessness boiling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Creation Herald, stop! If you keep this up, I swear the esteemed Lord Malevolence will come for you when he emerges! You know very well what that could mean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, the Shadow Terror Fiend paused, casually tossing aside the body of a fallen Paramount Supreme Clan warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Threatening me with Lord Malevolence? I'm allied with him, yet his underlings dare to overstep their bounds. Does he really expect me to care?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine clenched his teeth, desperation dripping from his tone. "It's all my fault, Creation Herald! This matter only concerns me. It has nothing to do with the esteemed Lord Malevolence! You've already killed many of us&mdash;surely your anger has subsided? Let's end this here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend fell silent, considering Icy Nine's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, he finally spoke coldly, "This time, I'll spare you for Lord Malevolence's sake. But mark my words&mdash;should you dare to transgress again, I will eradicate every last one of you, and even Lord Malevolence won't be able to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Shadow Terror Fiend vanished into the shadows.</span></p><div class="pagination">
