  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the rapid improvement made Osborne </span><span>thrilled</span><span>, he knew that he could not continue like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already the fourth day since he came to the Augustine family, but except for showing up on the first day, he stayed in the room for the other three days, observing and practicing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the heir of the Augustine family, after all. If he continued to remain hidden, suspicions would arise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Clarissa was still waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood up, walked into the bathroom, and </span><span>took a bath</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Ryan really a traitor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While washing, Osborne frowned and thought. After three days of observation, his suspicion of Ryan had weakened considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan maintained a disciplined routine, spending most of his time practicing hard. Occasionally, he would go out, but he only interacted with members of the Augustine family and never had any contact or conversations with outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this kind of person be a traitor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't think so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that he realized that he had been too optimistic. Osborne thought he could easily find the traitor, but it turned out to be much more complicated than he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With three hundred direct relatives in the Augustine family, any one of them could potentially be the traitor. Osborne, on the other hand, was just one person, and even with his Satan's Eye, it would be time-consuming to observe each person one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to change his approach and adopt a different strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His room was right next to Yulissa's. Over the past few days, he could hear the sound of her punching the sandbag. Like Queenie, she trained both her power and martial arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But until now, Osborne still didn't know what her powers were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knocked on the door, and Yulissa's voice echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pushed the door open, walked in, and found Yulissa practicing a set of leg techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a height of nearly six feet, her legs alone exceeded 3.6 feet in length. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment, she was wearing shorts that fully showcased her slender thighs as she continuously kicked and moved with astonishing speed. Her movements were agile and graceful, exuding a sense of beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was only eighteen years old, her martial arts level had probably reached Class C.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not far behind Queenie in terms of proficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's also a genius," Osborne exclaimed inwardly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, her level of skill was considered inadequate within the context of the Augustine family's ancient lineage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without reaching Class B, she could never become a pillar of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa let out a long breath, finally stopped, and turned her head to look at Osborne. A shy expression appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa continued awkwardly, "What's up? These past few days, you've been locking yourself in your room. I can sense faint energy fluctuations, and I know you must be practicing, so I didn't dare to disturb you.</span><span> </span><span>When do you want to start investigating my dad's death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his nose and said, "Let's start the investigation now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he walked to the bed and pointed at the mattress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a few questions for you. Can I sit down and talk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's cheeks turned red, and she nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sat down and asked, "Yulissa, I suspect there is a traitor in the Augustine family. If you want to know who killed your father, you must first find the traitor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's face drastically changed when she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A traitor?!"</span><span> </span><span>She frowned and continued, "Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. The test given to him by Godfather was to find the traitor within the Augustine family. So, there must be a traitor. Otherwise, this test would be meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trusted in Godfather's intelligence network.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure! Think carefully. What </span><span>do all the incidents involving</span><span> core members of the Augustine family ha</span><span>ve in common</span><span> during this period?</span><span>"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For example, when your father went out to sea, who knew about it? And when you went out to sea, who was aware of it? Who could have potentially leaked the </span><span>information?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa opened her mouth slightly and fell into deep thought, lost in her memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she shook her head and said, "I don't know. My father's trip to sea was confidential. Even I didn't know about it. I'm afraid the only people who knew about it were </span><span>the </span><span>Wise Order, a dozen of my uncles, and a few of the most outstanding members of the younger generation.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They... How could they betray my father?</span><span> </span><span>As for my trip to sea, I don't know who knew about it either. But there should have been quite a few people who were aware of it. I have no way of determining who could have betrayed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this were the case, things would become a bit difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He originally thought that through Yulissa, he could narrow the scope of suspicion. However, although the range did become narrower, it was still quite broad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his temples and realized that the first part of the mission, which he thought would be easy to complete, was likely going to be a challenging situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure enough, the test of being Godfather's successor is not something I can easily complete! However, I don't have much time to waste on this.</span><span> </span><span>Clarissa is still waiting for me, and Anastasia is waiting for me, too!</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that I have to temporarily put aside the first mission for the time being and proceed with the second mission first. Perhaps the traitor will show up in due time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the second mission, Godfather wanted me to resolve the difficulties faced by the Augustine family and lead them back to their former glory, making the family one of the top three ancient clans in Dampston!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This task is even more difficult! But I think I can start it now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
