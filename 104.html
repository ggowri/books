  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's cousin, Barlyn, had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, incredibly handsome with a smile, sauntered around with a carefree demeanor, giving off the air of a playboy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne knew that beneath Barlyn's playboy facade, there must be hidden strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's trust in Barlyn to protect Clarissa indicated that his abilities were definitely not inferior to Paul's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne observed Barlyn, he pondered, "Is he also a metahuman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Innate abilities are often hereditary, like my Satan's Eye inherited from Godfather. Donna is an earth elemental metahuman, so Barlyn is likely one too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Isa</span><span> mentioned that elemental metahumans have bodies as fragile as glass shards! Quite amusing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlyn, let me introduce you. This is Osborne Augustine, the man who saved me fifteen years ago," Clarissa said as she approached Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn looked at Osborne in surprise, extending his hand. "Hello, I'm Barlyn. Clarissa has been talking about you for fifteen years, urging me to help her find you. You saved Clarissa and thus, you saved me. I'll show you my gratitude through my actions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlyn, what are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa blushed, feeling a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Clarissa blush, Barlyn was momentarily stunned, his expression turning serious as he scrutinized Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's have a meeting," Donna interjected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meeting room, Donna, Clarissa, and Barlyn sat on one side, while Osborne, Harris, Violet, and Sharon, the four deputy heads, sat on the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd like to introduce Barlyn, my son. Starting today, he will temporarily assume the position of the head of the security team. I hope for everyone's cooperation," Donna announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris, Violet, and Sharon, who didn't covet the position, applauded warmly, earnestly assessing Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn stood up, wearing a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your support. You all are true elites, experts. I'm just a playboy, forced into this position. If I don't perform well, I ask for your forgiveness and assistance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shot him a glare at his words, though her eyes held a hint of indulgence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then rearranged the assignments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris remained in charge of the Bodyguard Unit Two, which was composed of members from various security companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharon and Violet continued leading Bodyguard Units Three and Four, respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the newly appointed deputy head, Osborne was assigned to Bodyguard Unit One, which was now left with only three members as most had betrayed with Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna promised to replenish it to ten members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn took charge of the Personal Guards, adding a dozen members he brought from the Radcliffe family to exceed twenty members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Paul's betrayal, Clarissa's security team not only maintained its size but expanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excluding the Surveillance Group, the number of bodyguards would exceed sixty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Barlyn's arrangement, Bodyguard Units Two, Three, and Four would take turns collaborating with the Personal Guards to protect Clarissa in eight-hour shifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Bodyguard Unit One, with only four members, had no immediate security duties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Osborne suddenly found himself with free time until new members were added. He could choose to work or rest as long as he remained on call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that's the temporary arrangement. Any objections? If not, let's get to work," Barlyn said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris, Violet, and Sharon nodded, then turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also eager to leave, as he hadn't forgotten about the money Davy had hidden in the villa. With the Aberrants' assassination attempt foiled, he could now go and collect it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, wait up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn caught up with Osborne, familiarly draped his arm over Osborne's shoulder, and grinned, "This is my first time in Mayby City. I want to go out, explore the town, and grab a few drinks. Wanna join me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, looking at Barlyn curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain Barlyn, you have time to go drinking? Don't you need to protect Ms. Radcliffe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn waved his hand dismissively. "Relax, everything's under control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his voice and said, "Our elders were furious when they heard about the assassination attempt on Clarissa. They pulled some strings and spent a fortune on an advanced warning system from the Draco Group. I've already had it installed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, no assassin will ever be able to sneak into the manor and attempt to kill Clarissa unnoticed. Besides, with the Personal Guards, the Bodyguard Unit, and my mom around, Clarissa's safety is guaranteed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can drink in peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this time, you're buying. My mom's been keeping a tight leash on me and froze all my credit cards. Otherwise, I wouldn't have taken this bodyguard captain gig. I'll pay you back when I get my paycheck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne felt a bit speechless, thinking, "Barlyn doesn't have any money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took this job as the head of the bodyguard because his cards were frozen and he needs to earn some cash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revelation sparked an idea in Osborne's mind.</span></p><div class="pagination">
