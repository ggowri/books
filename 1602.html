  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Osborne quickly spotted the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was situated over 10 thousand miles from Divine Peak Nine, completely enveloped by a massive divine power shield that shimmered in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, then decided against probing further into the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that real Deity King warriors resided within, and not just one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no idea just how powerful these warriors were, and he certainly didn't want to risk being detected by them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a Deity King warrior sensed his prying, it could spell trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he pulled his gaze away from the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the others on the deck were still eagerly scanning the horizon for a glimpse of Divine Peak Nine. Osborne understood that without some sort of enhanced vision technique, they would never be able to see it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Divine Peak Nine was colossal, like a landmass floating in the sky, it remained hidden from view due to the thick fog surrounding it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just any ordinary fog; it was infused with spiritual energy, creating a stronger barrier against their sight. Even Celestial Deity and Deity Overlord warriors would struggle to see clearly in such mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for his Satan's Eye, which had reached Level Nine, Osborne wouldn't have been able to see Divine Peak Nine either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a hidden world shrouded in mystery, captivating and eerie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a calm voice broke through the anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop looking, everyone! You won't see Divine Peak Nine from here! Even when we reach the base, we still won't be able to see it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hung in the air, and everyone turned to the speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a middle-aged man, his face marred by numerous jagged scars that resembled a </span><span>mass of centipedes crawling across his skin, sending shivers down the spines of those who looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he walked forward, the crowd instinctively parted, allowing him to step to the front of the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed toward Divine Peak Nine, his eyes reflecting a mix of nostalgia and deep-seated fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers began to ripple through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Kenneth Borden!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Mr. Kenneth Borden!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name echoed, drawing attention and respect as the </span><span>onlookers</span><span> exchanged glances filled with curiosity and apprehension. Someone whispered, "Mr. Kenneth Borden was a super genius from the Borden family back in the day. They say he was unmatched among his peers, even against talents from the Upper Races. There were rumors that if nothing went wrong, he could have reached the Deity King realm and become the second Deity King of the Borden family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even General Laird Borden from the City Guard used to follow him around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then, Kenneth had an accident&mdash;right at Divine Peak Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of sheer curiosity, he sneaked away from the Borden family to explore the peak, and during one of his deep dives into its mysteries, he got injured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those scars on his face? They're from that very incident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His foundation was affected, and he never managed to improve his strength afterward, remaining stuck at the late stage of Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The higher-ups in the Borden family tried everything to restore his foundation, but eventually, they gave up on him and shifted their focus to training Laird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for that mishap, Kenneth would at least be at the pinnacle of Deity Overlord by now, maybe even on the verge of breaking into Deity King! You could say Divine Peak Nine ruined him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs reached Osborne's ears, and he turned to look at Kenneth, who seemed unfazed by the gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm demeanor, Kenneth spoke again, "We'll be at the base soon, but I need to stress something important. If you can, don't leave the base! It's the only safe place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you step outside, you're entering a battlefield! The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> of Divine Peak Nine will come at you in ways you can't even imagine, ready to kill, torment, and instill fear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words silenced the crowd, the gravity of his warning sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, there's no need to panic too much. This operation at Divine Peak Nine is on a large scale, so you probably won't have the chance to wander off on your own. That should keep you a lot safer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, a slight grin crept onto Kenneth's face. "But that's not a guarantee. If you happen to offend someone important and get assigned a solo mission outside the base, well, then you'd better watch your back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a peculiar glance from Kenneth, as if he was being scrutinized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly, sensing an underlying message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bottom line, Divine Peak Nine is dangerous! The only ones you can truly trust are </span><span>your comrades! Believe me, you'd better hope you don't catch sight of Divine Peak Nine because if you do, it means you've already stepped into the most perilous territory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you ever get the chance to set foot on Divine Peak Nine, pray you make it to see the sunrise the next day! Of course, if luck is on your side, you might stumble upon some priceless treasures, like Celestial Crystals, Miracle Elixirs to elevate your realm or even ultimate divine artifacts..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
