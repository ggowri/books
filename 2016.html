  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone believed this would be a one-sided battle from start to finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Human Community shared this expectation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, as the battle commenced, the situation unfolded exactly as they had imagined, complete and utter domination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they had all guessed wrong about who would emerge victorious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crushing defeat happened, and calling it a 'crushing defeat' would be an understatement for the losing side. What happened in the arena wasn't even close to a normal contest; it was more like a... massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, a massacre!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, ten thousand members of the Blood Demon faction wiped out ten thousand geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elites of the Paramount Supreme Clan didn't even have the chance to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle began slowly, but it ended with terrifying speed. Before most could even comprehend what was happening, it was already over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan lay broken and lifeless on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Blood Demon members?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their losses numbered fewer than five hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long after the battle ended, the surroundings were eerily silent. It was so quiet that the sound of the gentle breeze could be heard clearly by everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deafening silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Osborne, Anastasia, Zoe, and a few others who had already known the strength of the Blood Demon members, everyone else stood in shock, as if they were trapped in a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Light was no exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Blood Demon members was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strength might not have been considered top-tier, but their coordination and synergy were nothing short of astonishing. Ten thousand fighters moved as if they shared a single mind, united like a brutal war machine that effortlessly crushed any enemy in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they strong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they stronger than Anastasia and Zoe?

They were killed, resurrected, and sent back into battle time and time again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their coordination and synergy had reached the pinnacle of perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combat experience was unparalleled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through countless trials, they had been forged into a terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Anastasia and Zoe would not want to be surrounded by the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were, they would be swiftly defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members' teamwork would make their lives a living hell, leaving them with no room to defend themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, the terrifying power of the Blood Demon members was revealed to the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence that enveloped the battlefield was their applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until much later that the silence finally broke, replaced by the roaring cheers of the Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheers grew louder and louder, deafening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had won again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was their fourth consecutive victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the number of victories wasn't the important part. What mattered was that the Blood Demon members, representing the Human Community, had slaughtered a team composed entirely of Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer disparity in strength made the Paramount Supreme Clan's so-called geniuses appear weak and pathetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan are nothing special after all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our warriors from the Human Community are no weaker than the Paramount Supreme Clan's geniuses. They're even stronger! Far stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A massacre! This was a massacre!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would have thought that our Human Community would one day crush and slaughter the geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The morale of the Human Alliance soared as the Blood Demon members dominated and slaughtered the Paramount Supreme Clan's elites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cheers rose like waves, boiling over like water in a cauldron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion stood in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were filled with confusion and panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could a team composed of Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses be crushed and slaughtered by a team from the Human Community of the same level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This was impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could the Paramount Supreme Clan, so proud and powerful, be this weak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the evidence was right before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much they refused to believe it, they had to accept it.

He had said there was a 99% chance of victory, and he had delivered." She thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the strength displayed by the ten thousand Blood Demon members had even shocked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How on earth did he train these ten thousand Scarlet Avengers? I've been working hard to train my Radiant Guardians, but I've never come close to achieving something like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not even a tenth of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those were ten thousand of the highest Deity King Level geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan! And they were slaughtered just like that? If the Human Community had a million Scarlet Avengers like this, even the Dark Deity Legion wouldn't dare to wage war anymore, would they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's eyes gleamed with excitement as she looked at the Blood Demon members on the battlefield, wishing she could recruit all of them for the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew that was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze shifted to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was currently sneering at Julian, his expression full of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked both shocked and bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been terrified by the combat prowess displayed by the Blood Demon members. "Even if I gathered all fifty thousand of the highest Deity King Level warriors from the HeartUnited Alliance, they probably still wouldn't stand a chance against the Blood Demon members, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would they, too, be slaughtered?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a shiver down Julian's spine, snapping him out of his daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he noticed Osborne's mocking face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cullen, I won! Not only did my subordinates defeat those Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses, but they also wiped them out in record time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you lost the bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time for you to pay up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne began walking toward Julian, step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's face darkened at the mention of the bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The bet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terms were clear: if I lost, Osborne would slap me, and I wasn't allowed to use divine power to defend myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was unacceptable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is something Julian just can't accept. "I am an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, one of the top three Dukedom Level powers in the Human Community, and the leader of the HeartUnited Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a warrior at the very peak of the Human Community's hierarchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I possibly allow Osborne to slap me in public?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that happened, how could I ever show my face again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Julian stared at Osborne, his expression filled with threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, your subordinates are indeed impressive.

You lost, so you have to pay up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Osborne had reached Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand high, ready to strike...</span></p><div class="pagination">
