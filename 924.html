  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had hoped for reinforcements, but as he glanced at the other battlefields, despair washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Everett and Rumen, top-tier Class S fighters, were overwhelming the Augustine family. Their strength was simply too much; the family stood no chance against such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realization hit him like a ton of bricks: without help, they would soon be wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they fell, it would mean the end of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Draco Group would follow suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with fury, a fierce determination igniting within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wouldn't allow that to happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian had entrusted him with the mantle of head of the Augustine family and the reins of the Draco Group. There was no way he would let them be annihilated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like I have no choice but to go all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, his gaze icy as he fixed it on the two Class S Medusa Queens, along with Scarlett, Bradley, and Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his lips, Osborne underwent a dramatic transformation. He morphed into a Vampire, his speed, strength, and defenses amplifying exponentially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't enough. He activated the Breath of Celestial, pushing his power to new heights&mdash;now at the fifth level, it doubled his strength once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone-like skin that had encased him shattered, falling away as the Medusa Queens' petrification powers lost their grip on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett and the others exchanged alarmed glances, their faces draining of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without giving them a moment to react, Osborne lunged forward, appearing before Scarlett, Bradley, and Marlon in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled the power of his right leg's Divine Bone, making his attack even more terrifying as he kicked out at the trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes widened in horror as they sensed the impending danger. They pooled their strength, desperately trying to fend off Osborne's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Osborne they faced now was a far cry from what they had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective scream echoed as the force of his kick shattered their arm bones, sending a jolt of agony through their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from their mouths as they were sent crashing to the ground, unable to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a single move, Osborne had left all three of them gravely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at him in sheer terror, unable to comprehend how a full-powered Osborne could be so overwhelmingly powerful. They had joined forces, yet not even a single blow could they withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear gripped them as they watched Osborne advance, intent on finishing them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Medusa Queens, seeing the dire situation, unleashed their petrification powers in a desperate attempt to stop him, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With gritted teeth, they positioned themselves in front of Osborne, trying to shield their allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face remained impassive as he unleashed another kick, sending the two Medusa Queens flying, their bodies nearly exploding from the impact, their fighting spirit crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett, Marlon, and Bradley were now paralyzed with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon shouted, desperation seeping into his voice, "Are you crazy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you kill me, my father will hunt you down! He's not far from here, and if you take me out, you're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "If I don't kill you, do you think he'll let me go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice turned venomous. "At least if you spare me, there's a glimmer of hope! If you kill me, it won't just be you who pays the price&mdash;everyone in the Augustine family will go down with you! The Thornberry family is not something the Augustine family can contend with! My father is a top-tier Class S, and my great-grandfather is the strongest in Blue Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to die, you'd better back off right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes blazed with fury. "You dare threaten me at a time like this? What's the Thornberry family to me? What's the League of Divine Descent? What's the strongest on Blue Planet? If you lay a hand on me or the Augustine family, you'll pay the price! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold glare, Osborne charged at the three adversaries, intent on taking them out and rushing to support Caleb and Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he moved, a wave of primal danger washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he dodged backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A devastating attack slammed into the ground right where he had been standing. If Osborne hadn't reacted in time, it would have crushed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, a tall figure stepped in front of Marlon and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Everett Rosenthal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's eyes lit up with hope. "You came to save us! Hurry, take him down! That bastard wants to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett nodded, determination etched on his face. "Don't worry, I'll handle him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, an overwhelming power radiated from Everett, enveloping Osborne in a fierce aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze turned icy as he stared Osborne down. "Osborne, I underestimated you. I didn't expect that even these three working together wouldn't be a match for you. You nearly killed them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep growing stronger, the entire League of Divine Descent is going to have sleepless nights!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's cut to the chase&mdash;you need to die!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
