  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the jeers and ridicule, Osborne walked away without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond noticed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, he spread Osborne's name, along with his disgrace, far and wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, Osborne became infamous in Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, countless people knew about a Human from the Human Community named Osborne. Despite being only at Ascension One Supernal Deity King, he had the audacity to seek entry into the elite exploration teams formed by Elf princes and princesses for the expedition to Umbra Earth. Rumors spread of how he had secretly reached out to these royals, hoping for a special evaluation, and had even boasted that he could achieve a Class S overall rating. In the end, he was utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everywhere, people talked about Osborne, their expressions filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those who had failed the evaluation felt a twisted sense of satisfaction because of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, at least they had qualified to take the test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Sylvan Elf Clan's assessment grounds, Joanna frowned as she watched Osborne's retreating figure. Hearing the surrounding mockery, she felt a pang of sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she only shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He came to me first, and when I turned him down, he went straight to Princess Peggy, hoping for special treatment. He really doesn't understand how things work. Not every member of the Elf Royal Family is as mild-tempered as I am! Peggy may only be at Ascension Two Supernal Deity King Level, but she is one of the most gifted members of the Storm Elf Royal Family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her Astral Testing Arch assessment, she received a Class S rating. It's her greatest source of pride. And Osborne? He actually told her that he was confident he could achieve Class S too. How could that not infuriate her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna sighed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just hope he doesn't take this too hard. He actually has decent talent and ability. That Ascension Five guard Desmond sent after he whipped at him several times, yet he dodged every strike...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his level is just too low. If he were stronger, I might've given him a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, no use thinking about it now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna pushed her thoughts about Osborne aside and refocused on the assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far from her, Letitia stood behind Chuck. She bit her lip as she watched Osborne leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Osborne, why are you doing this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why won't you listen to me and just leave Elf City? Not only are you staying, but now you even want to go to Umbra Earth...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this the reason you refused to leave? Do you want to go to Umbra Earth that badly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, then took a deep breath and sent Chuck a private message. "Prince Chuck, I have a request. I don't know if you'll agree, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck valued Letitia highly. After all, she had achieved a Class S overall rating. Hearing her words, he immediately responded with a smile. "Whatever it is, just say it! If I can help, I'll do everything I can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia hesitated briefly, then finally said, "Prince Chuck, can you let Osborne join our exploration team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean that Human who was just humiliated by the Storm Elf Clan? The one who's only at Ascension One and yet so ridiculously overconfident? Why would you want him on our team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia quickly explained, "Prince Chuck, Osborne isn't like that. He's actually very strong. I can feel it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please trust me. If you recruit him, he'll be useful to the team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking it over, he finally replied, "Letitia, I'm really sorry. If it were any other request, I'd do my best to fulfill it. But this... I just can't. There's a fixed number of spots in every exploration team, and I have to pick only the strongest members. Because of you, I've already made an exception to include Jaden and his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Osborne's level is simply too low! He's only at Ascension One. He wouldn't even be able to survive in Umbra Earth. What do you expect me to do? How would we even focus on exploring if we take him with us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The others on the team would be burdened by his weakness. If things go south, he could even get them killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just can't take that risk. And honestly, not a single prince or princess here would let an Ascension One Human join their team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless they've lost their minds, that's never going to happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck's tone was gentle, as if afraid Letitia would resent him for refusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Class S rating made her too important to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia's expression turned slightly dazed. After a brief silence, she sighed, "I understand. Thank you, Prince Chuck. I was asking for too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look in the direction Osborne had gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But by now, he was already out of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Maybe this is for the best. Maybe, after being humiliated, he'll finally leave Elf City. If that happens, at least he won't have to worry about Desmond's retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hope we'll have a chance to meet again someday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought left her feeling a little melancholic. For some reason, she was afraid that this was goodbye forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression remained cold as he walked away from the Combat Arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly made his way back to Emerald Forest Lodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia had assumed that, after his humiliation, Osborne would be too ashamed to stay in Elf City. She thought he would slip away quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't care about the humiliation. He knew that one day, he would have the chance to prove himself. His goal hadn't changed. He still wanted to enter Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that only there could he find treasures like the Soul of Umbra Earth, Sacred Crystal, Miracle Elixir, and Element Gold Crystal. Only there could his level and strength rise dramatically in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't about to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that none of the Elf Royal Family exploration teams would take him, he had to find another way in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The real problem is that I don't even know where Umbra Earth is. I need to locate it first. Then I can figure out how to get inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was easier said than done. The exact location of Umbra Earth was a closely guarded secret of the Elf Royal Family. They would never reveal it. He knew that it had to be somewhere near Elf City, but just knowing that wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. I'll send my Spatial Clone to search the area."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne strode toward his rented tree house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cheerful voice rang out. "Oh! You're back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda skipped over, looking as lively as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tilting her head, she studied Osborne's dark expression and couldn't help but smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look really, really mad. Did someone bully you? Come on, tell me! I could use a good story."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes gleamed with curiosity and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes at her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
