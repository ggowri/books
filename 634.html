  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne sent a message to No. 1, telling them they didn't need to bring the instructors and trainees from Training Base No. 6 to </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. Instead, they should head straight to the Draco Group headquarters in Campbell to handle the defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sorting everything out, Osborne remained alone at the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else had already left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' war was a brutal and merciless struggle for survival. Osborne wasn't just focused on preserving his score. He was more concerned with saving as many lives as possible. Therefore, he decided to abandon the defenses at </span><span>Dampston</span><span> and </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> and retreat to Campbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Campbell was an inland province.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne figured that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> wouldn't attack inland provinces until they had completely taken over the six coastal provinces. Otherwise, they'd risk being caught between two fronts. By withdrawing everyone to Campbell, he hoped to buy more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself, "Lance's defense of </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> has failed. I wonder if Vincent, Emma, and Matthew can hold off the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> in the coastal provinces they're defending. Their backing is incredibly strong. If they can't hold their ground, we're in big trouble." He checked the rankings of the six prospective heirs on the </span><span>Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance was still at the bottom, with over negative three thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Vincent's score changed, dropping him to second-to-last place with a negative 100 points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> have started attacking Vincent's defense in </span><span>Tyrisland</span><span>. With only one ordinary property lost and no other score changes, it seems Vincent has also chosen to give up on defending these ordinary properties without a fight," Osborne mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Vincent's score dropped further, negative 200, then negative 300, finally settling at negative 600 for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But within minutes, his score began to rise again. Sometimes, it increased by one point, sometimes ten. The highest jump was a hundred points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant Vincent's team was fighting the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Killing a regular </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> member only earned one point, while taking down a Class A master of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> earned ten points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only defeating a Class AA Aberrant rewarded a hundred points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicated that Vincent's team had managed to kill a Class AA Aberrant, which was encouraging for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Vincent's losses, though?" Osborne murmured, only to see Vincent's score drop by five hundred points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicated that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had overrun a rare metal mine under Vincent's defense. Vincent's score then stopped increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Vincent has also lost," Osborne said grimly, "A rare metal mine fell in just a few minutes? The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' strength is proving to be even more formidable than expected." His concern deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, he received confirmation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, leading a strong team, fought the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> at a rare metal mine, killing one Class AA Aberrant but losing one Class AA member himself. Ultimately, they couldn't hold out and had to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> continued their assault on </span><span>Tyrisland's</span><span> properties, rapidly lowering Vincent's score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Vincent and his team were left defending the Draco Group headquarters in </span><span>Tyrisland</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Emma, who was responsible for defending Halyan, was also under attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her situation was similar to Vincent's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite killing some strong </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, her losses were significant. All ten properties in Halyan fell, leaving only the Draco Group headquarters there still holding out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same fate befell Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the strongest support among the six heirs, including twenty elders from the Augustine family's main branch, Matthew still couldn't defend against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All ten properties in Jalmar fell quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Matthew and his team were left guarding the Draco Group headquarters in </span><span>Jalmar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Draco Group headquarters had the strongest defense systems, making them harder for the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> to breach. They could hold out for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the rankings on the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides himself and Owen, all four other heirs had negative scores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> must have planned this attack for years. We, on the other hand, are forced to defend hastily, which is bound to lead to losses," Osborne reassured himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, </span><span>Dampston</span><span> and </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> were finally hit by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had chosen to abandon the defense, but Owen hadn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to resist but suffered significant losses and ultimately couldn't hold out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Owen also had to give up other properties and focus on defending the Draco Group headquarters in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> now occupied the Draco Group headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's score plummeted to negative thirty-one hundred points, placing him below Lance in the rankings. He was now at the very bottom.</span></p><div class="pagination">
