  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light regarded the speaker, a man named Cicero Baxter, the head of the esteemed Baxter family, one of the ten powerful clans in West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reputation as one of the strongest warriors in Human Community lent weight to his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Benno Faulkner spoke up, "Esteemed God of Light. I must say I find great merit in what Mr. Baxter has pointed out. It's hardly a common occurrence for a Deity Overlord to single-handedly defeat a Deity King warrior, let alone seven of them suddenly appearing in East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This reek of deception! I suspect it could be a cunning scheme devised by the Dark Deity factions to undermine us and specifically target you, esteemed God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must remain vigilant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sending a rescue party from West Zone, which is a considerable distance away and within enemy territory, is an enormous risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we fall into a trap, the losses would be catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rumors of Paramount Supreme Clan planning a full-scale assault on West Zone Human Community are circulating, and we cannot disregard them. We must conserve our strength and prepare for that impending battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if these so-called 'Young Deity Kings' are truly exceptional warriors of the Human Community, their deaths won't change the big picture. But if any of you, or especially the esteemed God of Light, were to fall into danger, it could spell doom for us all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Benno's speech, the murmurs of agreement from the assembled leaders echoed through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benno's family, the Faulkner family, was one of the ten great clans in Human Community, and like Cicero, Benno was a top-tier warrior with significant influence in West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room buzzed with agreement as most present clearly opposed sending a warrior contingent to East Zone to rescue the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light maintained a serene smile, giving the impression of genuine interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, is this the consensus?" she asked, scanning the gathered assembly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, at the back of the grand hall, a tall man stood up, and his posture radiated confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a different opinion!" he proclaimed, drawing immediate attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro, what's your point of view?" Cicero and Benno exchanged wary glances, and their brows knitted in disapproval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really suggesting your concern stems from the fact that one of the Young Deity Kings shares a name with your missing daughter, Vivienne? Is that why you're so eager to rush to their rescue?" Cicero's tone dripped with skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benno chimed in with a similar tone, "And let's not forget, the leader of this Young Deity group is named Theodore. If memory serves, your daughter Vivienne left home in search of someone called Theodore, didn't she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you think Theodore among these young warriors is the same one?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a flimsy basis for proposing a rescue mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both men cast dismissive glances at Jethro Hudson, who was the head of the Hudson family, another one of the ten clans, albeit one ranked at the bottom and under threat of being ousted from the prestigious group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tensions between the Hudson family and the Baxter and Faulkner families had long been a source of friction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro felt the disdainful glances from Cicero and Benno, and he couldn't help but furrow his brow. "Cicero, Benno, that's not what I meant at all. Yes, it's quite a coincidence that the names of the Young Deity Kings, 'Theodore' and 'Vivienne', are the same as my daughter and her husband. However, I don't believe they are actually my daughter and her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their ages don't match up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While my daughter has talent, she doesn't compare to the 'Vivienne' among the Young Deity Kings. So, I'm not reading too much into it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a few steps closer to the God of Light, Jethro continued earnestly, "Esteemed God of Light, I simply think our situation as a Human Community is already dire. With the emergence of these young super talents, we can't just turn a blind eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we do nothing and allow Paramount Supreme Clan to lead the Dark Deity Legion into a full-scale war against the West Zone, do we really believe we can hold them off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just surviving won't be enough to fend off the Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a fantasy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given our current strength, we stand no chance against their onslaught! For years, if it hadn't been for Lord Malevolence getting injured by the Shadow Terror Fiend at the divine peak, and if the Dark Deity Legion hadn't been distracted by those peaks, we would have crumbled long ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't win this battle on our own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need the next generation of talented warriors to rise, and only then do we stand a chance! And now, when we know that seven super talents from Human Community are in East Zone and possibly in danger, there are those among us suggesting we do nothing? Just let them fend for themselves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's irresponsible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I seriously suspect that some of us have already aligned with Lord Malevolence! Some may be afraid of the consequences if we actually go to rescue the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jethro's gaze turned steely as he locked eyes with Cicero and Benno, challenging their dismissive attitudes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
