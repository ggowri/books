  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of excitement at the thought. This idea aligned perfectly with his own plans, and changing the plight of the East Zone Human Community had been his goal from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I operate in the shadows as part of the Wild Flame Army, while simultaneously building a faction to protect the Human Community in the open, I'll have two strategies working in tandem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One can support the other; If one approach fails, the other will provide a safety net. This increases the chances of success exponentially."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts ignited a flame of enthusiasm within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that he'd been kicked out of the Swift family and wouldn't receive their protection anymore, teaming up with Betty and her group to establish their own power was not only feasible but also advantageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he sensed potential in these people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you tell me more about your plans?" he asked Betty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she saw that Osborne seemed intrigued, Betty's face lit up with joy. "Well, to be honest, we don't have a concrete plan just yet. Right now, it's more of an aspiration. All we can do is unite for our future and fight tooth and nail against anyone who wishes to harm us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we're willing to go all out and be fearless, even without Deity Overlord protection, major factions from other races will hesitate to cross us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, we can secretly reach out to any Human Community warriors hidden in the wild, inviting them to join us. Once we establish our presence in Wild Flame City, hope will blossom! The day any one of us breaks through to become a Deity Overlord, we'll truly be a force to reckon with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won't have to worry about being hunted down and can live like those of the Swift family or Fairfax family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes sparkled with anticipation, and hope ignited in the faces around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne shook his head slightly. "That's too small of a goal! If you just want to live like the Swift family, I have to say, we're not cut from the same cloth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and the others looked at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, Osborne replied, "I know what I'm talking about. I belong to the Swift family, so I'm quite familiar with their situation. On the surface, they seem to hold a decent position in Wild Flame City, but in reality, they're still looked down upon by the larger factions of other races."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we're going to form a faction, we can't aim so low."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our goal should be for the entire Human Community in Wild Flame City, and even throughout the East Zone, to stand on equal footing with the other races. We ought to make them respect us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's a topic for another time. I'm genuinely interested in your ideas. Let's figure out what we should call our faction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement bubbled among the group as they reacted to Osborne's willingness to take the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're going to be our leader, it's only fitting that you come up with the name!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded thoughtfully. After a moment, he declared, "Let's name our faction Spark of Blaze! Just like a small spark can ignite a raging fire, we hope to be that first spark, lighting the way for the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this Spark of Blaze, we will fan the flames of hope, bringing in more warriors who will join our cause and work together to change the fate of the Human Community in Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, the room buzzed with enthusiasm, and determination radiated from every face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty's eyes sparkled with excitement as she whispered, "Spark of Blaze? I love it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll call ourselves Spark of Blaze! This little spark is going to ignite a fire that spreads from Wild Flame City all the way across the East Zone and through the entire Celestara! Our Human Community will never again be crushed by other races!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her enthusiasm was infectious, and a wave of energy coursed through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, smiled quietly, holding his ground, "Before we kick off the formal establishment of Spark of Blaze, there's something I need to clarify. Since you've chosen me to lead, it's crucial that you understand one thing: from now on, my word is law."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My commands will be the highest directive of Spark of Blaze."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone has a problem with that, I'll step aside, and you can go ahead and develop Spark of Blaze on your own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air grew tense as he finished speaking, and the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Betty gritted her teeth and replied, "You can count on us, Mr. Lachlan Swift! Every single one of us will follow your orders without question! That goes for the three of us sisters as well. Anyone who dares to defy your command will have to deal with us first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned sharply, her gaze icy as she scanned the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone's not willing to heed Mr. Lachlan Swift's commands, now's the time to speak up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence hung in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room knew the weight of the situation; they were survivors who had been preyed upon in the past, lost and desperate until Osborne came along and offered them hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they understood that Osborne was currently just a Transcendent Deity and might not match the strength of many present&mdash;let alone the formidable trio of sisters&mdash;they wouldn't dare oppose him, especially with Betty's fierce backing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great! Since there are no objections, I hereby</span><span> announce that Spark of Blaze is officially established!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
