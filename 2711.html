  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Quinn, who was hiding behind the other two, with disdain and scorn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prince Quinn, you weren't like this back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why have you become so cowardly and started hiding?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn felt embarrassed and snorted coldly, "Do you think I'm afraid of you? If you have the guts, put down that bow and arrow! Face me in a fight, do you dare?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze was provocative.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't you want revenge on me? I'll give you the chance! Back then, I often had people torment you, you bastard! Now, you're still nothing but trash in my eyes. Drop that bow and arrow. I can defeat you easily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you dare?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed. Under normal circumstances, he certainly wouldn't pay attention to Quinn's provocation. Since he could seriously injure or even kill Quinn with a single shot from the Apocalypse Bow, there was no reason not to use it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he's not stupid!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne needed to vent his pent-up anger and killing intent. If he defeated or seriously injured Quinn with just one arrow, it wouldn't be satisfying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he smiled and said, "Alright, I'll satisfy you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He drew the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying Sacred Power Arrow instantly took shape and shot out rapidly, targeting one of the Royal Family's Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Power Arrow unleashed by the Apocalypse Bow was incredibly fast, so much so that even a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior couldn't react in time. Moreover, the Apocalypse Bow had a locking function on its target. In just the blink of an eye, the Sacred Power Arrow struck the Royal Family's Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a thunderous boom, the body of the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior was directly pierced and blown apart. He didn't even have time to let out a scream before he was completely dead. Yet, the Sacred Power Arrow still didn't vanish; instead, it swiftly curved and pierced through another Royal Family's Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, causing another loud explosion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was also killed by the Sacred Power Arrow unleashed by the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their cultivation level was merely Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Weston, who had reached Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, couldn't withstand Osborne's Apocalypse Bow and was directly pierced through. There was no way they could resist it either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, they died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Quinn felt stiff and terrified, watching as the two Royal Family Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors beside him were killed by Osborne with a single arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that if this arrow were aimed at him, he wouldn't be able to dodge it and would surely die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, Quinn became overjoyed and excited, unable to help but burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you're so foolish! You actually wasted a one-time chance on two useless trash. Now, your bow can't be used anymore. You can't defeat me at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're doomed very soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn unleashed immense power, radiating a frenzy of killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, while Osborne is merely an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior. There is a gap of two minor cultivation levels between them. After Osborne could no longer use that strange bow, Quinn was absolutely confident he could defeat Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard, how dare you seek revenge on me and the Royal Family?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Today, I will kill you and present your corpse to my father! He will surely appreciate me. Once he abdicates, the throne of the Glorious Divine Kingdom will be mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn took out his Supreme Sacred Artifact, unleashed his power wildly, and attacked Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne remained calm and slowly put away his Apocalypse Bow, which could only be used once a day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just fired an arrow, and now the Apocalypse Bow in his hand was less useful than an ordinary sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne put it away and took out the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, looking at Quinn. "Do you think without the Apocalypse Bow, I can't deal with you? You still want to kill me and deliver my corpse to Emperor Frederick?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quinn, the ridiculous one is you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow, and the Sacred Power Arrow swiftly shot out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This bow and arrow is just a Superior Sacred Artifact. You can use it against some weaklings, but you think you can use it against me? That's utterly ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn wasn't taking Osborne seriously at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially after seeing the Sacred Power Arrow shot by Osborne instantly crushed by his unleashed power, he became even more confident, wearing a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne remained silent, continuously drawing the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Human Arrow, Three-Arrow Volley!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Human Arrow, Ten-Arrow Volley!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Human Arrow, Arrow Storm!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne executed the four moves of the Solar Sacred Arrow's Human Arrow one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the power of the Human Arrow was naturally no match for someone like Quinn, a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, the Sacred Power Arrow shot by Osborne was instantly crushed upon colliding with Quinn's power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't care, as he was merely venting at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, One Arrow Strike!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne finished using the Human Arrow and began unleashing the more powerful Earth Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud boom erupted!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Earth Arrow was far more powerful than the Human Arrow. With Osborne's current Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection cultivation level, even if it was just a One Arrow Strike at full force, ordinary Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors couldn't withstand it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Sacred Power Arrow collided with Quinn's attack, producing an extremely terrifying explosion that shattered part of his attack, instantly enraging him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You damn bastard, you're just an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior. How can you be this strong? If your cultivation level were a bit higher, reaching Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, perhaps even I wouldn't be your match!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn gritted his teeth and unleashed his power even more furiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne still maintained his rhythm, continuously drawing the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, Three-Arrow Volley!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, Ten-Arrow Volley!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow grew increasingly powerful. Even though Quinn was going all out, the Sacred Power Arrow instantly shattered his attack, even piercing through it to strike his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn panicked immediately. He quickly donned a Sacred Artifact Armor and took out a Defensive Sacred Artifact, barely managing to block Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just breathed a sigh of relief when his face suddenly turned pale, as countless Sacred Power Arrows were already coming at him again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, Arrow Storm!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne coldly drew the Bloodwrought Bow, countless Sacred Power Arrows instantly enveloped Quinn, shattering all his attacks before striking his defenses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's terrifying Sacred Power Arrows, carrying his fury and killing intent, instantly shattered Quinn's Defensive Sacred Artifact and then struck his Sacred Artifact Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn was instantly blown away. He couldn't withstand such a barrage of Sacred Power Arrows. His Sacred Artifact Armor became utterly battered, and he kept spitting out blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud bang, his body slammed heavily onto the Invictus Field and then slid down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn spat out another mouthful of blood, sinking into despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was defeated head-on by Osborne with a Superior Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn couldn't accept this fact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Nothing is impossible! In my eyes, whether it's you, Naomi, or Weston, you're all just trash!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he walked toward Quinn step by step with a cold expression.</span></p><div class="pagination">
