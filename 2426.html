  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over twenty thousand Ice Beetles fell from the sky like icy lumps, as if it were raining.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With these twenty thousand Ice Beetles taken out, their pressure immediately eased. The remaining few thousand Ice Beetles were no longer a threat and were quickly eliminated by their joint efforts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they all looked at Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stared at the Ice Scepter in her hand with shock and greed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of them gave it their all but couldn&rsquo;t handle the Ice Beetles, yet Brenda effortlessly took out more than half of them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This power clearly didn&rsquo;t come from herself but from the Ice Scepter in her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is definitely the Ultimate Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, a top-tier Empyrean Sacredness warrior infused power into this Ultimate Sacred Artifact! After all, only an Ultimate Sacred Artifact can store power, something even a top-grade Sacred Artifact cannot achieve!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda just needs to activate the Ice Scepter, and it can unleash the stored power inside without consuming a bit of her Sacred Power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this is Brenda's trump card!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Skyearth Dominion, as the most powerful First-rate Power, having an Ultimate Sacred Artifact is normal, but Brenda hasn't even broken through to Empyrean Sacredness. Yet they entrusted her with the Ultimate Sacred Artifact and even infused it with power for her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda's status in Skyearth Dominion is higher than we thought!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd murmured softly, all showing envious expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are all geniuses from major forces, but most of the weapons they use are just low-grade Sacred Artifacts, with even mid-grade Sacred Artifacts being rare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Brenda is already using an Ultimate Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Comparison is truly cruel!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a few people were the most embarrassed&mdash;Dustin, Mckinley, and other championship favorites. They once regarded Brenda as a competitor, but now, seeing the Ultimate Sacred Artifact in her hand, the Ice Scepter, they no longer thought so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, the spoils and resources they gained were far inferior to hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda wiped out twenty thousand Ice Beetles in one move. According to their agreement, all of these were her spoils.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One Ice Beetle is worth 2,000 Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Twenty thousand Ice Beetles equal 40 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's Kingdom Duel Scorepoints are nearing 100 million. Dustin, Mckinley, and other championship favorites can no longer surpass her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they exchanged a helpless glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda is definitely the champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since we can't compete with her for the championship, let's see who can get second place! Brenda is too strong. Losing to her isn't shameful. If we can secure the runner-up in Eastern Zone 3, that would still be impressive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They regained their fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From this moment on, they no longer saw Brenda as a competitor or someone to chase. Instead, they directly ignored her and gave up on the idea of competing for the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The runner-up was their limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda also sensed this change and couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength of several top contenders was still very strong. Now that they had given up competing with her for the championship, she felt even more confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the ground covered with Ice Beetle corpses, she felt the championship was hers for sure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, among the contestants, no one else had an Ultimate Sacred Artifact like Brenda's Ice Scepter. Her Ice Scepter was at the level of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, personally enchanted and infused with Sacred Power by the leader of Skyearth Dominion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was enough for her to use such an attack more than twenty times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she could take out 20,000 Ice Beetles each time, she could eliminate 400,000 in twenty attempts!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she could earn 800 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Ice Beetles were denser, Brenda could take out even more in a single attack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she would earn more Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, possibly exceeding a billion in the end!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a case, Brenda believes no one's Kingdom Duel Scorepoints would surpass hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is confident she will be the champion!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, for Brenda to achieve all this, she needs the help of these contestants. After all, no matter how strong the Ice Scepter is, it's hard for her to take down all the Ice Beetles alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, she needs these people to gather the Ice Beetles for her, so each strike can kill more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without their help, her gains would be much less.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Brenda said, "Everyone, please help me gather the loot! Also, there were a total of 30,000 Ice Beetles this time, and I took down 20,000 of them myself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"According to the agreement, they are all my spoils alone! However, I don't quite agree with this distribution plan, so I've decided to take only 50% of the loot, which is 15,000."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The extra 5,000 Ice Beetles will be distributed among you. After all, we are a team. I hope that after the zone duel ends, even if you can't achieve a top ranking, you'll still be able to exchange for plenty of Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Brenda showed a sincere smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at her </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>surprise. "Brenda, do you really only want 50% of the loot and are giving us the 5,000 Ice Beetles to distribute?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda smiled and said, "Of course! I keep my word. Besides, if we encounter more Ice Beetles later, I'll still only take 50% of the loot, and the rest will be yours to share."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words made everyone even more surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Brenda said she wanted 50% of the loot, but no one agreed because they thought she was too greedy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, their thoughts have completely changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To deal with the Ice Beetles, they really could only rely on Brenda and her Ice Scepter. Without her, they wouldn't stand a chance against them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, she only wanted 50% of the loot. They felt she was already being very fair!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I agree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I agree too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have no objections!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone agreed. At this moment, they were completely impressed by Brenda. Many showed expressions of admiration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She immediately smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She waved her hand and said, "Don't worry, everyone. If we encounter Ice Beetles next, I'll use the Ice Scepter to deal with them and ensure your safety. At the same time, I promise you'll all get plenty of loot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, gather the loot. Let's move on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This glacier area is like a treasure trove of Ice Beetles for us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Brenda felt excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The team of over 800 contestants set off once again. This time, they were no longer cautious. They even deliberately made noise, trying to lure the Ice Beetles out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, with Brenda around, the Ice Beetles posed no threat to them and would only become their loot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, not far from them, Osborne sat on Flash's back, pointing at the dense swarm of bugs ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, </span><span>take them down</span><span>!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
