  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not take action immediately, but opened the Draco Star Wristlet and began to research information about this rare metal mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current authority, that wasn't&nbsp;a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon he got what he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rare metals produced in this mining area are mainly lithium, beryllium, tantalum, niobium, etc. These rare metals are important components for manufacturing national defense weapons and high-tech weapons such as atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and missiles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that the rare metals produced in the mining area were indeed important. Still, the output was not large and the value was not particularly high. At least in Osborne's opinion, it couldn't attract the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, these rare metals weren't&nbsp;</span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> specialties. They also existed in many countries where the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> are active.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> did not seem to show much interest in these rare metals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so strange!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I always feel that the real target of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is not these rare metals. It must be something else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, these things are vital to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>&nbsp;said it wanted to return to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and destroy the Augustine family.&nbsp;Maybe it's just a cover!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The real reason they started the war was for something in these mines!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, but couldn't think of the reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, stop overthinking! Once we take back this rare metal mine and capture a few people alive, we will know what they want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne nodded immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think it's too complicated! No matter what the purpose of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> is, as long as we take back this rare metal mine and capture a few people alive to interrogate, everything will be clear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Osborne used Satan's Eye to check around the mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before taking action, he must find out the strength of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> guarding here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His powerful ability of perspective allowed him to see the situation in most of the mining area. Except for some very deep mines, no other place can escape his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two Titan dukes with Class AAA?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Others, there are still a dozen Class AA and dozens of Class A? Are there no other </span><span>masters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These titans&nbsp;were powerful. Matthew&nbsp;and Emma would find it very difficult to capture such a rare metal mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne now, this was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Clarissa discussed it and decided not to inform the members&nbsp;of Blood Demon, because they could capture this rare metal mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll launch a sneak attack first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked Clarissa to stand still, while he activated the dark element and transformed himself into a black shadow, moving quickly in the shadows of the mining area.&nbsp;He slowly approached a Titan duke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan Duke was very powerful and had a strong defense, but not flexible enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, it was too easy to deal with a Titan duke alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he could also launch a sneak attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne hid in the shadow of the Titan Duke, but the Titan Duke didn't feel it at all. His huge shadow became the best cover for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, hurry up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ship the last batch of cargo away, and we can evacuate here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That damn Osborne, we underestimated his strength. He has already breached the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> Headquarters and will be here soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must retreat quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan Duke gave loud orders, asking everyone to speed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The last batch? Looks like I've arrived at the right time! Let me finish off you first, big guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tightly grasped the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down, then up at the Titan Duke's huge body and neck. He was a little worried and wondered if he could cut the opponent's neck with one hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never mind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't cut your neck, I'll smash your head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became furious and took action immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne showed up from the darkness, wielding the Goddess of Grain's scythe and cutting fiercely at the neck of the Titan Duke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan Duke instantly sensed something was wrong, but his huge body was very clumsy, so it was too late for him to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only burst out his strength, attempting to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, the Goddess of Grain's scythe&nbsp;broke his defense, and then easily cut through the skin and flesh of his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan Duke's powerful defense seemed to disappear in front of the Goddess of Grain's scythe.&nbsp;He could be killed easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cut all the way through with one hit, directly cutting open the Titan Duke's huge neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan duke's head was instantly separated from his body, and blood gushed out like a fountain.</span></p><div class="pagination">
