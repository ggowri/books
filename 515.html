  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan stared at the crowd and let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up. I didn't call you all here for some big deal. It's simply because some of </span><span>you deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, everyone's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They began to clamor again, looking at Nathan in disbelief. Many of them already had a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan ignored them and said coldly, "Now, I'll announce your crimes and the consequences! Stand still. Anyone who moves will die first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anemone Gang is dealing drugs, running casinos and entertainment venues, forcing ordinary people to sell drugs for you, forcing women to sell their bodies, forcing...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Tanaxes</span><span> Gang is dealing in smuggling and firearms, forcing...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's pace was quick as he rapidly announced the crimes of each gang. The gang members whose names were called turned pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're going to kill us all!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shouted loudly, "They didn't call us here for business. They're planning to kill us all! Are you going to stay here and wait to die? Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the crowd erupted into chaos. Many people took advantage of the confusion and quickly tried to flee the Augustine estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne saw the situation and let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clapped his hands, and a large group of Augustine experts appeared. They mercilessly subdued all the gang members trying to escape, breaking their limbs and throwing them to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These gang members had no ability to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, piercing screams shattered the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaotic crowd saw the terrifying and brutal strength of the Augustine family and immediately stopped, fearfully returning to their places.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan let out a cold laugh. "Trying to escape? That's just asking for death! I already told you, if you listen quietly, you might not die! But if you cause chaos and try to run, then you must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he continued to announce the crimes of several underground gangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each underground gang whose name was called looked terrified. They hadn't expected the Augustine family to have investigated them so thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to run. Seeing the experts eyeing them and the gang members with broken limbs lying on the ground, they didn't dare to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone shouted, "We're underground gangs. We deal in shady business. What right do you have to judge us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan looked at Osborne when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally spoke, "Why? Good question! Let me tell you why. I am stronger than you! You don't treat ordinary people like humans, and I don't treat you like humans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The crimes you've committed need to be repaid in blood! This time, I'll only kill the ten underground gangs that have committed the most crimes. But from now on, no </span><span>underground gang in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> is allowed to bully ordinary people!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I find out otherwise, no matter how many of you there are or what backgrounds you have, I'll kill you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, he waved his hand sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill everyone in those ten gangs. Leave no one alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, and the experts immediately moved. They had already targeted the members of the ten gangs and quickly charged in to begin the slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ahhh</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horrific screams kept ringing out. Blood sprayed everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the underground gang members watched in terror as the members of those ten gangs were quickly killed, with no ability to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, all the members of those ten gangs were completely wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene became extremely bloody. Everyone held their breath, not daring to make a sound. They all looked at Osborne in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and said calmly, "Chop them all up and feed them to the dogs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he spoke, they immediately took the bodies away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne in even greater fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "Don't be afraid. I said I wouldn't kill you, so I won't. But you'd better remember what I said. If any of you go back and bully ordinary people or commit crimes again, don't blame me for personally wiping you out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll have people watching you. You'd better be careful! There's no end to making money. If you dare, I'll chop you all up and feed you to the dogs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guarantee that if you do, you'll die even more horribly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, do you understand?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining members were terrified and quickly responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we understand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We promise we won't bully ordinary people anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won't dare to do it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "I hope you really won't dare! If you bully ordinary people, I'll bully you twice as hard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're not afraid of death, then go ahead and try!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, and all the underground gang members fled in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the Augustine estate became quiet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a cold and angry voice suddenly rang out behind Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you sure are arrogant! But bullying some worthless underground gangs doesn't prove anything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'll make you kneel and beg for forgiveness!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
