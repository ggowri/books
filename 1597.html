  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Calvin prepared to strike, Sylvia and her companions immediately moved to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As descendants of Osborne's Blood Clan, their loyalty was unwavering; they would protect him at all costs, even if it meant laying down their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way they would allow Calvin to attack Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Osborne quietly ordered them not to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just Calvin, after all&mdash;he didn't need their interference yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, Osborne watched as Calvin, rage etched across his face, advanced menacingly. "What's this? You're actually going to lay a hand on me? You're a chiliarch, and so am I. If you attack me, you're breaking military protocol! And remember, I won't just sit back and take it. With all these witnesses around, if I accidentally kill you, don't say I didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin sneered at the suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Military protocol?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does that matter? I'm going to take you down today, rules be damned! You think you can fight back? You really believe you stand a chance? I've been holding back out of respect for that mysterious Deity Overlord warrior from Spark of Blaze. But guess what? This isn't Spark of Blaze, and that Deity Overlord isn't here to protect you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a bit faster than the rest, but we're on the Malevolence Airship now&mdash;this place is too cramped for you to use that speed to your advantage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What makes you think you can match me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence radiated from Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was at the peak of the Celestial Deity realm, while Osborne had only recently broken through. Without the speed advantage, Calvin didn't see any possibility of Osborne being a match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice turned icy. "Osborne, I've put up with you for long enough! I was going to enjoy slowly humiliating and tormenting you, but since you're so eager for a fight, I'll give you what you want!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to cripple you today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Calvin lunged forward, delivering a powerful punch aimed squarely at Osborne's chest, targeting the very essence of his divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes flashed with cold determination. "Cripple me? You think you can do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick movement, Osborne dodged Calvin's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounded by crackling lightning, he activated </span><span>Thunderform</span><span> Flash, allowing him to move with blinding speed&mdash;even in the confined space of the Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's expression shifted, surprise flickering across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Let's see how long you can keep that up! Surround him!" he barked at his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained </span><span>calm,</span><span> his demeanor unshaken. "Calvin, I suggest you stop right now. I've tolerated you long enough! This is the Malevolence Airship, overseen by Athena, leader of ten thousand. Fighting here is against the rules, and if you break them, she will punish you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin scoffed, a smirk creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he thought, "Osborne really thinks he can intimidate me with Athena? He'll never guess what my connection to her is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules here were set by Athena herself! Even if I break them, she'll back me up. How could she ever punish me? If I take down this punk, I'll get all his secrets, along with his Essence Crystals and treasures. It'll all be worth it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought fueling him, Calvin launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to </span><span>evade,</span><span> his expression serene. "Calvin! This is your final warning. Stop now! You're a chiliarch, and so am I. Attacking me is a breach of protocol, and if you don't back off, I'll have no choice but to retaliate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin looked at Osborne with open disdain, acting as if he hadn't heard a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't concerned about Osborne's threats of retaliation. In his mind, if Osborne truly had the strength to fight back, he wouldn't be dodging time and again, relying solely on his speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Calvin hoped Osborne would finally take a stand and confront him head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the reality was that Osborne moved like a slippery eel, far too fast for Calvin to pin down in the cramped space of the Malevolence Airship; he couldn't even graze the hem of Osborne's cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Calvin regretted not bringing more followers with him to back him </span><span>up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your last warning! I'm going to retaliate! Everyone here sees it; they can vouch that I'm not the one looking for trouble. It's Calvin who's crossing the line, forcing my hand!" Osborne shouted, growing more impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd around them was all too eager to watch the spectacle unfold, with no intention of intervening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Osborne's warning, one of them called out, "Just hit back already! We all saw it was Calvin who struck first. We'll back you up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! We're here for you! You have to defend yourself!" another voice chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, don't just dodge! Go toe-to-toe with Calvin!" someone else yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! We got your back! If Ms. Athena Huntington punishes you for this, we'll stand against it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd rallied, growing more animated with every shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of these spectators were loyal to Osborne, and the united voices urging him to retaliate began to swell into a chorus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept onto Osborne's face as he took in the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, did you hear that? You've pushed me to this point!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
