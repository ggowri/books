  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used spatial power to escape at incredible speed. With each interdimensional travel, he could traverse extremely long distances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he realized Frederick was catching up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick didn't have spatial power, but he possessed an extremely powerful Supreme Sacred Artifact, which also enabled interdimensional travel. Driven by his immense strength, his interdimensional travel speed was no slower than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The distance between them was closing rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Sure enough, we can't underestimate anyone! With Emperor Frederick's speed, hardly anyone can escape from him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>But I am an exception</span><span>&#65281;</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne sped up his interdimensional travel again. Instantly, he widened the gap with Frederick a bit. They then maintained this distance, with Frederick chasing and Osborne fleeing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick looked furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected that Osborne had become so powerful that even with the Sacred Artifact, he still couldn't catch up to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was merely an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This realization made Frederick even angrier. He was determined to kill Osborne and deny him the chance to grow further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard, you can't escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On the Racial Convergence Planet, no one has ever escaped from me, ever!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's voice exploded in Osborne's mind like rolling thunder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and said disdainfully, "Never before? Well, starting now, there will be! If you're not convinced, then keep chasing! Let's see who gives up first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "Then let's give it a try!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite his anger, he remained confident and arrogant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed that with Osborne fleeing at such a speed, he definitely couldn't last long, and at the very least, Osborne would exhaust his strength before him and be unable to maintain the pace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Frederick had already reached the bottleneck of Imperial Empyrean Sacredness and could break through at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne's cultivation level was only at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, not even Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick absolutely didn't believe Osborne could maintain such a fleeing speed, as his Sacred Power couldn't possibly withstand such consumption. So, he thought as long as Osborne slowed down a bit, he could catch up to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, run!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once you slow down, it will be your death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick kept pursuing while contacting his warriors, instructing them to use the Cosmic Translocator to intercept Osborne from the front.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, he became even more confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was also thinking quickly. Just now, he received a message from a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior under his control, saying that Frederick had ordered them to intercept him from the front.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "You want people to intercept me from the front and then gang up on me? How ridiculous! You probably don't know that a large portion of your people are already under my control, do you? I know all your orders!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly changed direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, if he fully unleashed his spatial power, he was confident he could distance himself from Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he could quickly construct a Cosmic Translocator and escape to a place far beyond Frederick's reach.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne didn't do that because the current situation was just fine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he was no match for Frederick, he wouldn't be easily caught either. He could completely stall Frederick, leaving him no time to search for the Fairy Moon Sect's secret base.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could buy Adriana, Isa, and the others more time to train and improve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne controlled his speed, ensuring that Frederick, chasing behind him, wouldn't give up but also couldn't attack him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And every time those ordered by Frederick to intercept Osborne ahead took action, Osborne would know in advance. Then he would immediately change direction, causing their interception to fail.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Frederick extremely furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This damn bastard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick roared, "He changes direction at the critical moment every time, as if he knows my men are intercepting him ahead! And why is his Sacred Power still so strong? When will he finally run out of his Sacred Power?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly felt a bit powerless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was like a slippery fish, always within sight but out of reach, keeping an ambiguous distance between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to attack Osborne, but he simply couldn't.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick didn't give up and said again through Telepathy, "Osborne, do you dare to stop and fight me? Don't you want revenge on me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you forgotten that Michelle was executed by me? Everyone, including myself, knew she was innocent, yet I still executed her without hesitation!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you want to know the reason?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, don't you want to know why I hate you and Michelle so much, and why Queen Callista targeted you both?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Actually, it was all under my orders!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was the one who instructed Queen Callista to punish you and Michelle, and I was the one who made her frame Michelle! I just wanted to find any excuse to execute Michelle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, I've told you the truth. Aren't you angry?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you want to know the reason?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's words echoed in Osborne's mind. Osborne couldn't help but tremble, clenching his fists with killing intent and anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick burst into laughter. "I can feel your killing intent and anger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you want revenge? Do you want to know the truth? If you do, then stop! We can talk it out slowly. I'll tell you everything you want to know!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry! I won't rush to attack you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll let you know the truth first, then kill you, leaving you in eternal despair!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop. As long as you stop, I'll tell you the truth!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were bloodshot, and he clenched his teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Frederick was deliberately trying to provoke him, forcing him to stop, and then silently surround him to prevent his escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's reason told him not to stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, he stopped, glaring angrily at the approaching Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me the truth!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "You really have guts! Don't worry. I keep my word. Since I said I would tell you the truth, I will! After all, you're about to be a dead man. Telling you won't change anything!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and said coldly, "Go ahead! Why do you hate and target us? Why did you frame my mother and deliberately have her executed? What did she do to anger you so much that you'd treat her this way?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clenched his fists, glaring at Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick merely laughed, "You want to know why I targeted you and had her executed? It's quite a long story."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you sure you want to hear it?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick looked at Osborne provocatively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne growled, "Yes! No matter how long the story is, I want the truth today!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick nodded and said, "Alright! Then I'll tell you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The reason I hate and target you is because you're not my son at all! Your mother had an affair with another man behind my back!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
