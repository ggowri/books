  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's assertiveness clearly caught Murray off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression darkened, and he opened his mouth to speak, but Guy beat him to it. "Murray, this is my territory. You come here, expecting me to apologize to one of my centurions? And you think you can intimidate me with General Herman Saxton's name?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you really think I'm someone you can push around? Do you think the Borden family is easy prey?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we don't settle this today, you won't be walking out of here upright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Guy activated the divine power barrier around his office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray's face went pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guy, are you looking for trouble? You really want to throw down over something so trivial? You've got to be out of your mind! Mr. Donald Saxton is General Herman Saxton's son! You'd better think twice before you act!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy laughed, a cold, mocking sound. "Oh, so we're still using Herman to scare me, huh? Sure, he's a general, but the Borden family isn't without our own generals! Just because he wears a star on his shoulder doesn't mean his son can strut in here and disrespect me. You think I'll just take it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald, sensing the tension, jumped in. "I didn't mean to disrespect you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy shot him an icy glare. "Whether you did or not is for you to figure out. But let me be clear&mdash;unless you explain yourselves today, you're not leaving this office in one piece. Do you think I'm afraid of you? Do you think the Borden family is scared of the Saxton family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray realized he was in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy was clearly losing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want, Guy? So General Herman Saxton vetoed your promotion. It's just a lowly human. Why are you making such a big deal out of it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a cough interrupted the escalating tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stepped out from the shadows, his voice calm yet firm. "It's quite rude to label me as part of a lowly human in my presence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray and Donald turned to see Osborne, their faces filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So you're Osborne? Hmph! We've heard your name buzzing around Wild Flame City. You've stirred up quite the ruckus! But do you really think you can talk to us like that? You're asking for trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just a lowly human centurion, and I'll say it again to your face&mdash;you're nothing but a worthless human! What are you going to do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray's arrogance was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald added with a scoff, "The chiliarch position I'm taking from you? It's a privilege for you to be considered! And if you're feeling upset about it, wait until I'm promoted. I'll make sure to assign you to my squad, and I'll wipe the floor with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shot Osborne a challenging look, but Osborne merely laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, this is rich! I've heard from Guy how much the Saxton family enjoys targeting the Human Community, but I didn't quite grasp the extent of it until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since that's the case, I guess there's nothing left to say!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guy, take action!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's order hung in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take action? What do you mean? You think you can just command Guy? You really think you have a say here?" Murray sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before Murray could finish, he was stunned as Guy lunged at him without hesitation, unleashing a powerful attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murray froze in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Guy, are you insane? You're actually taking orders from a lowly human? You dare to lay a hand on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's expression turned cold, and he dropped the pretense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare to disrespect my Lord? Murray, it's time for you to hit the ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two early-stage Deity Overlords, both leaders of ten thousand, engaged in a fierce battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald stood there, eyes wide with shock, and quickly backed into the corner, unable to believe what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "How does it come to this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he had no time to dwell on it as Osborne suddenly appeared before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, saying, "So, you're Donald? Herman's son? For Herman to dare steal my promotion for you is practically a death wish! I can't touch Herman right now, but you're fair game!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before I turn you into a Blood Clan member, I'm going to teach you a lesson you won't forget!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald's anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Teach me a lesson? You lowly Human Community member, you're the one asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Donald lunged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his mind, Osborne was merely at the early stages of Celestial Deity, just as he himself was. Considering he hailed from the prestigious Aether Hawks Clan and was their prodigy, Donald inherently believed his prowess exceeded that of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He charged forward, aiming a punch straight for Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne were an ordinary early-stage Celestial Deity, Donald's blow might not kill him, but it would certainly leave him with serious injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face turned even colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He casually raised his hand and, in an instant, caught Donald's fist. Despite Donald's efforts to break free, he couldn't budge an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Donald's shock was evident on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You, you lowborn Human Community member..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne slapped Donald across the face, and a row of teeth flew out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
