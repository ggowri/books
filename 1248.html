  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six Junior Deities of the Pantheon League were utterly outmatched by the Intermediate Deity of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their numbers, they were struggling. However, Joseph and Helios were now engaged in what appeared to be a serious negotiation. All eyes were on the two as they seemed to be inching toward some sort of agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaotic battlefield shifted from a fierce melee to a standoff, with both sides tempering their abilities, wearing their energy like a fraying rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gods of the Deschanel Clan and their Pantheon League counterparts paused to assess the situation, waiting breathlessly for the outcome of Joseph and Helios' talks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the animosity between Joseph and Helios gradually dissipating, all of them knew that this war might soon be coming to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, just as the atmosphere hung heavy with anticipation, Osborne decided it was time to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Utilizing his Phantom Steps, he glided effortlessly through the parallel space, invisible to all&mdash;the Junior Deities, the Intermediate Deities, and even the Supreme Deities were oblivious to his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved like a wraith, honing in on the targeted Intermediate Deity from the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes narrowed as he set his sights on the man's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne reappeared from the shadows, his divine artifact dagger cloaked in seething dark power, poised to plunge into the heart of the Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard and with his attention solely focused on the six Pantheon League adversaries in front of him, the Intermediate Deity was completely unprepared for this sudden attack from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he even registered the danger, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's speed was blinding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger pierced through the protective Ethereal Glow with ruthless efficiency, plunging deep into the heart of the Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pulse of dark energy erupted from the weapon, a terrifying force that was simply insurmountable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with a Level Two Divine Body, he stood no chance against a sneak attack of this magnitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening explosion filled the air as his Divine Body ruptured, an agonizing finale for a god who had thought he was safe. Unless he had a Cosmic Treasure like the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, this man was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As quickly as he had struck, Osborne vanished, leaving behind chaos in a matter of seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attackers still facing him&mdash;a bewildered group of six&mdash;had scarcely processed what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One moment, they were struggling, and the next, the Intermediate Deity from the Deschanel Clan lay dead at their feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first </span><span>god</span><span> to fall in this divine conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell just happened?" they muttered, eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Within moments, another Intermediate Deity from the Deschanel Clan caught sight of their fallen comrade, and rage ignited within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with lethal intent as he glared at the six Junior Deities. "Whoever killed my kind won't get away with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, he charged toward them, a tempest of fury unleashing as he bore down on the six, attacking with relentless ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait! It wasn't us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We swear, we didn't do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their pleas fell on deaf ears as the wrath of the Deschanel Clan's Intermediate Deity descended upon them like an avalanche.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming force of his blows shattered the air, sending the six reeling. They fought to defend themselves, yet the sheer power of his assault had them gasping for breath, blood spattering as they fell back under the onslaught, their bodies on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" the Intermediate Deity screamed, consumed by rage as he prepared for another blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Pantheon League wasn't about to let him have his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reinforcements surged forth, and a powerful Intermediate Deity joined the fray, surrounding the Deschanel Clan's attacker on all sides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the tides turned, and the balance of power shifted drastically. With nowhere to escape, the Deschanel Clan's Intermediate Deity found himself in a perilous position, overwhelmed and in dire straits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their comrade struggling, the other gods from the Deschanel Clan couldn't just stand by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the war resumed its intensity, with both sides engaging in a fierce and earnest clash once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew this wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous moment when he had effortlessly annihilated an Intermediate Deity from the Deschanel Clan had filled him with confidence. Osborne was certain that with his current strength, he held an absolute advantage over Intermediate Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with the powerful concealment effect of his Phantom Steps, he could become a fearsome assassin, hunting targets on this chaotic battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he locked his gaze onto another Intermediate Deity from the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's figure reappeared behind the Deschanel Clan's Intermediate Deity, </span><span>vanishing as swiftly as he had come. But in that fleeting moment, a massive blood-red hole had already appeared in the deity's chest, and dark power erupted violently within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second Deschanel Clan Intermediate Deity's Divine Body exploded in a mighty blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This turn of events infuriated nearly all the Deschanel Clan deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill! Kill every last one of these bastards! Else, we're all </span><span>gonna</span><span> die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan deities launched a frenzied assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with their mad onslaught, the Pantheon League deities responded with equal ferocity, retaliating with all their might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They </span><span>ain't</span><span> that tough! They've already lost two Intermediate Deities. We can take '</span><span>em</span><span> all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wipe '</span><span>em</span><span> out!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
