  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes turned resolute. "No way! I won't let that happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I have enough strength, no one can destroy the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan fell because Terrence wasn't strong enough! If he had been, it would've been the Augustine family on the chopping block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's survival of the fittest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything boils down to power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Osborne, am confident that I can protect the Augustine family, protect everyone I care about. If I grow strong enough, no one can hurt them&mdash;no one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Osborne waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! The Deschanel Clan is no more; we need to head back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Osborne absorbed the thick blood energy lingering in the air, temporarily storing it within himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eighteen Transcendent Deities and nine Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan had perished here, causing the blood energy to reach an extraordinary density, enough to help nearly two thousand members of the Blood Demon clan break through from Junior Deity to Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, most of the Blood Demon members would elevate to Intermediate Deity, growing their strength significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne returned to the Augustine Bastion with Divine Shadow, God of Star, and all the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat of the Deschanel Clan was resolved, yet the Augustine Bastion was oddly quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The senior members of the Augustine family were busy taking over the Deschanel Clan's assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chose not to get involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the priority was clear: he needed to boost his own power. After experiencing the formidable strength of a Superior Deity, his anticipation of breaking through to that level grew exponentially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rules of the Blue Planet are incomplete; a Transcendent Deity warrior can't advance to a Celestial Deity. So, in theory, the strongest warrior here can only be a Transcendent Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I reach the level of Superior Deity, I can take down Terrence in just three moves! He's undoubtedly the top-tier Transcendent Deity. Once I become a Superior Deity, I won't fear anyone on the Blue Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on this, Osborne felt a rush of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept pondering, "I need to break through to Superior Deity as quickly as possible! It's been a while since I moved past Intermediate Deity, and my power is stable enough for a breakthrough! Plus, I can't shake the feeling that Isa and the others might be in danger. I need to level up fast so I can find them and help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that determination, Osborne entered his seclusion once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He first distributed the gathered blood energy through the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, ensuring those who hadn't yet advanced to Intermediate Deity received their share.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he focused on his own breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While others faced immense difficulties transforming from Intermediate Deity to Superior Deity&mdash;requiring vast amounts of natural energy, repeated refining, and a lengthy period to succeed&mdash;Osborne's path was far simpler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had completed a three-step integration with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, so extracting energy from it was a breeze. The energy level from the Lotus meant Osborne didn't need to undergo the tedious refining process; he could directly absorb it to enhance his divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This process would be hundreds, if not thousands, of times faster than the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed the Breath of Celestial, successfully drawing energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quietly absorbed and refined it into his own divine power, feeling his strength surge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne sensed his Divine Body undergoing a transformation, growing significantly stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon forging the Divine Body, one was considered a deity, and a deity's body could undergo up to three transformations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first occurred when breaking through to the Superior Deity, the second at the Celestial Deity, and the third when reaching the Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, with Osborne standing at the threshold of Superior Deity, his Divine Body was set to undergo its first transformation, elevating from its already formidable state to an even greater power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I break through to Superior Deity, I might just achieve the fourth step of integration with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! At that point, my soul will be shielded by the Lotus. Even if my soul is crushed by an enemy, the Lotus will protect me from death, allowing me to resurrect! Then, I'll truly possess an immortal body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a thrill through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he quickly reined in his enthusiasm, settling into a calm state as he focused on his training, patiently awaiting the moment of his breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed slowly in his secluded space, marked only by the steady rhythm of his breath and the pulse of energy within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Augustine family was bustling with activity. After decimating the Deschanel Clan, Rosmandi and the surrounding nations found themselves with no opposing forces capable of standing against the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of dozens of powerful factions had been transformed into loyal Blood Clan descendants utterly devoted to Osborne. The influence of the Augustine family had skyrocketed, expanding its reach exponentially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the surrounding nations now firmly under the Augustine family's dominance, they had become the undisputed rulers of the region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne was deep in his breakthrough, Sebastian took the reins, managing the family's affairs personally. Day by day, the strength of the Augustine family surged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, Osborne's plans to expand the Draco Armed Services Branch began to take shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Talented individuals from across the nations flocked to join, eager to be part of the elite force. After a rigorous selection process, the most exceptional candidates emerged, ready to become members of the Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><div class="pagination">
