  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two long years of seclusion and consuming nearly a thousand Blue Miracle Elixirs aimed at enhancing his elemental essence, Osborne's dark elemental essence finally made its breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he transcended from the peak of Level Eight to Level Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the dark energy enveloping Hope Haven erupted in a frenzy, as if celebrating the arrival of their king.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire sanctuary trembled under the chaotic surge of dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone paused in their tracks. Whether it was Anastasia and Zoe, who had been deep in their own training, the Blood Demon members honing their skills, or even Sebastian and Divine Shadow caught up in a tender moment&mdash;they all turned their astonished gazes toward Osborne's secluded space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Osborne just break through? But what kind of breakthrough creates such a commotion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've all had our breakthroughs before, but nothing like this! Not even close!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Bryce, Diana, and Hannah emerged from their chambers, followed by Sebastian, Divine Shadow, and God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had experienced significant growth during their time in Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the two-hundredfold time acceleration in Hope Haven, while Osborne spent nearly twenty days gathering Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals across the ten divine peaks in the South Zone, they had effectively lived through nearly six years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with Osborne's two additional years in isolation, they had collectively spent eight years in Hope Haven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their talents, combined with the rich energy of the sanctuary and the abundance of Miracle Elixirs at their disposal, the improvements they made during this time were nothing short of extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most visible change was in their cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others had all reached the advanced Deity King Level, with Anastasia being the fastest, having even reached the pinnacle of that stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was crucial to note that after reaching the Deity King level, each incremental advancement became incredibly challenging, requiring vast amounts of time and energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they hadn't even actively sought to elevate their level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had heavily relied on the red Miracle Elixirs to boost their levels, they would have already attained the peak of the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For them, elevating their level was secondary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their primary focus lay in enhancing their Divine Bodies and elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, over these eight years, everyone had made substantial progress. They had stirred up some commotion in Hope Haven, but nothing compared to the spectacle Osborne had just unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a tremor in his voice, Bryce spoke up, "This dark energy feels terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It reminds me of Lord Malevolence's dark energy! Remember when I tried to take down Caesar and ended up getting hurt by Lord Malevolence's darkness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Bryce finished, the others exchanged alarmed glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they forget?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That incident had nearly cost Bryce his life! Even with Osborne and Hannah's combined efforts and the consumption of several white Miracle Elixirs, it had been a close call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all of this was due to the sheer terror of the dark energy emanating from Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Bryce was saying that Osborne's dark energy bore a striking resemblance to Lord Malevolence's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's expression turned serious. "Osborne must have broken through his dark elemental essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was at the pinnacle of Level Eight before, but now he's definitely crossed into Level Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group gasped in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it just a breakthrough to Level Nine? There's such a massive commotion over that? I remember, Anastasia, your lightning elemental essence broke through Level Nine, too, and while it was impressive, it was nothing like this! Our elemental essences aren't far from Level Nine, either. I can't imagine we would create such a stir! If you told me Osborne was breaking through to Level Ten, we'd believe that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia smiled, "Osborne is different from us. His Level Eight elemental essence is far more powerful than our Level Nine essences!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Overall, this is a positive development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We all know how terrifying Lord Malevolence's dark energy is, and now... Osborne is likely not far off from that level himself! The only thing he's lacking is the cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, admiration sparkled in Anastasia's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group felt a surge of excitement. For them, Osborne's growth meant greater strength for their team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but wish for his invincibility against Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the intense waves of dark energy began to settle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone focused their attention on Osborne, only to find him enshrouded in darkness, almost like a black hole, making it impossible to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has he finished his breakthrough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They waited for Osborne to awaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was indeed awake, but as his dark elemental essence broke through to Level Nine, an overwhelming flood of information surged into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right at that moment, he was deep in the process of absorbing and understanding it all.</span></p><div class="pagination">
