  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the auction hall of the Luminous Commerce Center, five types of Miracle Elixirs were up for grabs, each distinguished by its color and potency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The least valuable was the red Miracle Elixir, known for enhancing one's rank. For most individuals, advancing in rank was a relatively straightforward process. It merely required time&mdash;a commodity that held little weight for those above Junior Deity status, who enjoyed long lifespans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next in line was the blue Miracle Elixir, which improved elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it was tougher to enhance elemental essence compared to rank, with enough insight and dedication, progress could be made, albeit slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the black Miracle Elixir, which refined both soul and comprehension, was valued similarly to the blue one&mdash;about five times the worth of the red elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most prized were the white and yellow Miracle Elixirs. The white Miracle Elixir was legendary for its ability to heal nearly any injury, ensuring that as long as one wasn't dead, they could be revived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having even a single white Miracle Elixir on hand felt like possessing an extra life. It was an item no one could refuse. Unless, of course, one was like Osborne, who boasted immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow Miracle Elixir, which enhanced the Divine Body, was equally sought after. The reason for its high value stemmed from the extreme difficulty of upgrading the Divine Body. From Junior Deity to Deity King, there were only three opportunities for transformation, after which further enhancement became nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard one tried, advancing the Divine Body was a monumental challenge. Even the once-renowned Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings mostly reached only Level Eight Divine Body, while the vast majority of Deity Kings, including Supernal Deity Kings, barely scraped by at Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This stark reality underscored just how difficult it was to improve the Divine Body, with the yellow Miracle Elixir being the only significant aid available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow Miracle Elixir was naturally more rare, making its value astronomically high. Most people simply couldn't afford it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the auction featured two white Miracle Elixirs and one yellow Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside Osborne, Tristan's eyes gleamed with desire as he gazed at the white Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, deep down, he knew they were beyond his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Kurt nor Osborne would allow him to win a bid for any white Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of bitterness lingered in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now up for auction is the white Miracle Elixir, also known as the Life Miracle Elixir! No matter how severe the injury, as long as you have the white Miracle Elixir, you can preserve your life and recover swiftly! The starting bid is two thousand Celestial Crystals. Let's get started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the auctioneer's words echoed in the hall, Kurt had learned his lesson this time. He didn't raise his paddle immediately. He knew that, regardless of his bid, Osborne would outdo him and then take the opportunity to humiliate him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he decided to let Osborne make the first move, just so he could turn the tables and mock Osborne in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, for his part, held back as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, the white Miracle Elixir was practically worthless. First, he had no need for it due to his immortality. Second, there was Hannah, who possessed life power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life power was just as effective as the white Miracle Elixir, and for them, the only benefit of the white elixir would be to enhance potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't impressed by the white Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he believed its healing properties weren't all that impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the incident with Bryce, who had been gravely injured by Lord Malevolence's dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite using dozens of white Miracle Elixirs, they couldn't save Bryce. If Osborne hadn't shattered Lord Malevolence's dark energy, Bryce would have surely perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In general, Osborne had little interest in the white Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, it wasn't worth his time or the Celestial Crystals, but he certainly wouldn't mind letting Kurt waste a few just to see him squirm. If Kurt didn't bid, Osborne wouldn't bother bidding either, which set the stage for an unusual silence at the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, as the minutes ticked by, the air grew thick with tension, and no one dared to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt was convinced that Osborne was simply waiting for him to initiate the bidding, only to raise the stakes and humiliate him all the more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined not to give Osborne the satisfaction of seeing him struggle again, Kurt kept his paddle down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on the other hand, was amused by the standoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for him to piece together Kurt's dilemma, and a chuckle escaped his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning slightly closer to Tristan, he said with a grin, "Since Kurt's not gonna bite, why don't you give it a shot? You're here looking specifically for a white Miracle Elixir&mdash;two thousand Celestial Crystals shouldn't be an issue for you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan blinked, caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to bid?" he asked, confusion washing over his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his eyes sparkling with encouragement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Tristan lifted his paddle, his voice barely above a whisper. "I'll bid 200 thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals! That's all I've got, but if anyone raises, I'm out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced nervously at Kurt, hoping his bid would fly under the radar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's brow furrowed in disbelief. He hadn't expected Osborne to stay quiet. Instead, it was Tristan who had thrown his hat into the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected turn of events left him feeling cornered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Osborne's mockery-laden gaze pointed in his direction only made him more frustrated.</span></p><div class="pagination">
