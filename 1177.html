  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was buzzing with anticipation, his heart racing as he felt the transformation unfolding within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Cain, lurking nearby, was glued to the scene, eager to see just how powerful the Divine Body forged from nine strands of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's core energy would turn out to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain mused, his mind racing, "Level Five seems reasonable, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he's just become a Junior Deity. If his Divine Body hits Level Five right off the bat, who knows? It might even reach Level Eight in the future! Many Deity Kings can't even pull that off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in my day, I only had a Level Three Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Primordial Crimson Lotus, I'd have maxed out at Level Six, never reaching the Level Seven Solar Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What about him? Level Five? Maybe even Level Six? The core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus is just that remarkable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waited patiently, feeling the rapid metamorphosis within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, a faint red Ethereal Glow surrounded him, but as time passed, that glow thickened and deepened, transforming into a mesmerizing crimson hue that resembled blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this change left Osborne frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is it still just a red Ethereal Glow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red Ethereal Glow was indicative of a Level One Divine Body. He could feel the strength and perfection of his Divine Body growing with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the persistent red glow puzzled Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hadn't transitioned into the orange of a Level Two body, let alone the yellow of Level Three or the green of Level Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a sense of urgency creeping in. "My transformation seem to have reached a critical stage, so why is the Ethereal Glow still red?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he began to worry, a shift finally occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne expected the red glow to morph into the vibrant orange of a Level Two Divine Body, it instead began to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-dazzling crimson light dulled to a pale red, then to a faint pink, and eventually, it vanished completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transparent Ethereal Glow was a sign of a Divine Body without any level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Level One Divine Body typically manifested a red glow, a hallmark of most Class S warriors who became Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Level One Divine Body was often referred to as a foundational Divine Body and, in less flattering terms, a Waste Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, true Waste Divine Bodies had no level at all; they were the result of individuals lacking the necessary talent but somehow lucking into becoming Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Divine Bodies bore certain flaws, rendering them incapable of even achieving a Level One status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such Divine Bodies were the real deal when it came to Waste Divine Bodies, and their defining feature was an Ethereal Glow that was entirely colorless&mdash;transparent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne's Ethereal Glow had shifted rapidly from that eerie crimson to complete transparency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Osborne shocked, but Cain was equally taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transparent Ethereal Glow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's a Waste Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is this even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain furrowed his brow, disbelief etched on his face. He had expected Osborne's Divine Body to at least reach his initial guess of Level Five or Six, but a Waste Divine Body? That was unthinkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, his mind racing to identify the source of this unexpected outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What went wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something's off! Before this transformation, my body was already incredibly strong, roughly on par with a Level Three Divine Body! Even if I were to forge a Divine Body in the usual way, I should have stepped up to a Level Four Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, using the Breath of Celestial along with the supreme force of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to refine both my Divine Bones and Flesh, this should have turned my Divine Body into something far beyond my expectations!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I didn't reach the level of a Level Seven Solar Divine Body, at the very least, I should be at Level Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why am I stuck with a Waste Divine Body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wait a minute. I can clearly sense that my Divine Body is extremely powerful! It's not just ten times; it's a hundred times stronger than before the transformation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, my body was comparable to a Level Three Divine Body, and now that it's a hundred times stronger, how could it be a Waste Divine Body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, my Divine Body definitely isn't a Waste Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My path of cultivation is unique and different from anyone else's. So maybe the color of the Ethereal Glow doesn't really represent my Divine Body's true level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as my Divine Body is powerful enough, who cares about the color of this </span><span>glow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transparent Ethereal Glow means a Waste Divine Body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If my enemies underestimate me because of this, thinking I'm a pushover, they'll be in for a brutal surprise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he'd sorted it out, Osborne stopped obsessing over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder, though, just how strong is my Divine Body? Can it truly match up to a Level Seven Solar Divine Body? Hopefully it's not too far off, or else Lise might be disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne focused on his bodily changes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From this moment on, he was truly a deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Granted, he was just a Junior Deity, but a deity nonetheless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His life essence had transformed, granting him an extended lifespan and divine power far beyond that of ordinary mortals.</span></p><div class="pagination">
