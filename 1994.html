  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, if you want your so-called geniuses from the Human Community to die early in the arena, I'm more than happy to oblige!" Icy One sneered, waving a hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that signal, ten thousand soldiers emerged from the ranks of the Dark Deity Legion, each one at the peak of Celestial Deity Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, from the Human Community's coalition, another ten thousand soldiers stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were grim and tense. The previous battle between the Transcendent Deity Level fighters had shown them just how brutal and savage this contest could be. Every one of the Human Community's Transcendent Deity Level geniuses had perished in that arena&mdash;none of them had made it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, as they lined up for the new fight, they couldn't help but wonder&mdash;was their fate going to be the same?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way out was to wipe out every enemy in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of them hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't just fighting for their lives; they were fighting for the honor of the Human Community. If they showed fear, if they backed down, the respect of their people would be trampled underfoot by the Unity Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even knowing that stepping into the arena could mean their deaths, they marched forward without a second thought, climbing onto the viewing platform with steely resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stage was set. Ten thousand Celestial Deity Level geniuses from the Human Community, facing off against the same number from the Unity Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the battle begin!" Icy One's low command rang out, and with that, the fight erupted. The blood, the carnage&mdash;everything repeated just like the last time. The numbers on the arena floor dwindled rapidly as the two sides clashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's elites, watching from the sidelines, couldn't hide their growing unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene unfolding before them was eerily familiar&mdash;the same brutal violence, the same heartbreaking outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the Human Community geniuses fought with all the courage and ferocity they had, but in the end, it wasn't enough. They managed to take down about eight thousand of the Dark Deity Legion's fighters, but one by one, they fell, their bodies littering the viewing platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy, suffocating silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Sanctum of Light, the leaders of all the major Human Community factions were visibly shaken, their eyes bloodshot with frustration and anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two straight losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hand-picked geniuses of the Human Community had fought valiantly against the Dark Deity Legion's best, only to fall short twice in a row. Every time, there had been a glimmer of hope, a sense that victory was within reach, but in the end, it was always the same&mdash;defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, your Human Community lost again!" Icy One's mocking voice echoed through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk! Get on with it!" </span><span>God of Light</span><span>'s voice was ice-cold, but anyone who listened could feel the rage and sorrow brewing beneath her composed exterior. She was holding it in, struggling to suppress the torrent of emotions threatening to spill over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew this was part of the plan&mdash;the losses were painful, but they had a purpose. If they could just buy enough time, it would be worth it, even if it meant losing thousands of the Human Community's finest geniuses in battle, one fight at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing them fight so fiercely, knowing they were giving everything, only to end up dead on the arena floor... it cut deeper than she could express.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she was the leader of the Human Community. She was their pillar. She couldn't afford to show weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going!" she ordered, her voice steady despite the turmoil inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up were the Deity Overlord Level fighters&mdash;ten thousand from each side. These were powerful, seasoned warriors, their strength far beyond that of the previous groups. Maybe it was the bitter taste of the earlier defeats that fueled the Human Community fighters, or maybe it was just sheer determination, but this time, the Human Community's Deity Overlord Level geniuses came out swinging with unmatched ferocity and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it was a victory&mdash;though a pyrrhic one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a thousand of the Human Community's Deity Overlord Level geniuses were left standing in the arena. The rest had been wiped out, their bodies scattered on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One scowled, clearly irritated. "I didn't expect you to win a single match. But it doesn't matter. I got careless. Next time, your Human Community won't win a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deity King Level battle... let's start it right now!" he ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span>'s face remained hard and unreadable, though her thoughts were heavy. Yes, the Human Community had won at the Celestial Deity Level, but the cost had been devastating. And it was true, as Icy One had pointed out&mdash;the Dark Deity Legion hadn't even unleashed their best fighters yet. The ten geniuses from the Upper Races had been few, and there wasn't a single Paramount Supreme Clan genius in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion hadn't even tried to go all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Human Community? They had thrown everything they had into this. Every top fighter they could spare had been sent out, all to make a statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, the outcome left her speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the battle wasn't over. The competition had been initiated by the Human Community&mdash;it couldn't end with them backing down. To do so would be disastrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they retreated now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the arena battles were over, the Dark Deity Legion would launch a full-scale attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The death toll for the Human Community would skyrocket&mdash;hundreds, maybe thousands, more would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So they had no choice but to keep fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night... where are you? Come back... please. Don't let any more of our people die. Only you can put an end to this war that should never have even begun," </span><span>God of Light</span><span> whispered to herself, but her face remained a mask of stoic determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her hand, signaling the start of the next round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, ten thousand of the Human Community's top Deity King Level fighters flew up to the viewing platform, their presence commanding the attention of everyone in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the Human Community factions, standing beside </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, couldn't hide their growing concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew the gravity of this match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deity King Level fighters were pillars of any major faction. Many of the ten thousand Human Community elites were not just warriors&mdash;they were their families, their nieces and nephews, their children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Human Community lost here...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost would be too much to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If things are looking hopeless, you can surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span>'s voice echoed in the minds of every Human Community fighter on the arena platforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This border competition will last a long time! It's not just about today. Even if we lose today, we can still win in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you can't win, surrender! Save yourselves. The Human Community will need you for the battles ahead..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hung in the air, and every Human Community fighter on the platforms shuddered involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all turned their eyes to </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, their gazes burning with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one spoke. Instead, they all locked their eyes on the thousand enemies standing across from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight for the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight for glory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle exploded into chaos once more. For these ten thousand Deity King Level fighters, the arena&mdash;which spanned a 300-mile radius&mdash;was beginning to feel cramped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wave after wave of attacks flooded the battlefield, engulfing the entire arena in a storm of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At their level, their vitality was immense, making them harder to kill, but that only made the battle more brutal and blood-soaked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though </span><span>God of Light</span><span> had urged them to save themselves if the fight was too much...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, no one from the Human Community surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fought until the very last man, until the last ounce of strength left their bodies...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one from the Unity Clan surrendered. How could we, the Human Community, surrender?" one fighter shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the final Human Community warrior self-destructed in a fiery explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once again, the Human Community lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All ten thousand of their Deity King Level fighters perished in the arena, leaving only a handful of the enemy standing&mdash;less than ten of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a battle of mutual destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty thousand Deity King Level warriors, and in the end, fewer than ten remained alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An oppressive silence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
