  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After leaving Vice City, the three of Osborne immediately altered their appearances and auras.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, they found a hotel and checked in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "In three days, the Phantomagic Realm will appear. But I don't know where it will show up. However, it shouldn't be too far from Inferno Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't just stay here for these three days."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'd better continue studying the Cosmic Translocator and fully master the construction method of the Level-3 Cosmic Translocator!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne locked himself in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He first checked the condition of the Bewitching Lantern. After obtaining it, Osborne immediately hung it on the branch of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree can suppress the aura of the Bewitching Lantern and erase the mark left by the Blossom Cage leader on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This way, even the leader of Blossom Cage cannot sense the location of the Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took it down and left his own mark on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Bewitching Lantern is a Legendary Sacred Artifact. It's incredibly valuable, yet the leader of Blossom Cage actually has ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns and can even form a Bewitching Formation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bewitching Formation is even more powerful than a Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I get the chance, I must get my hands on the other ninety-eight Bewitching Lanterns."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne continued to hang the Bewitching Lantern on the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne began learning to construct the Level 3 Cosmic Translocator. With his previous experience, he learned much faster, and under a hundredfold time acceleration, three days equaled ten months.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By just the eighth month, Osborne had completely mastered the Level 3 Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, as long as I have enough materials, I can completely build a Level 3 Cosmic Translocator on my own. This skill should be considered top-notch even on the Racial Convergence Planet, right?" Osborne was very satisfied with this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the short term, Osborne did not plan to continue learning to construct a Level 4 translocator, because even if he mastered it, with his current level of spatial power essence, he still couldn't build the translocator on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, the Level 4 Cosmic Translocator can instantly traverse multiple Stellar Regions, even teleport across galaxies, with a maximum range of one million light-years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne right now, he simply has no use for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he couldn't gather the materials to build a Level 4 Cosmic Translocator. Even if he did, the massive amount of Sacred Crystal needed to activate it once was far beyond what he had.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I become stronger, I'll learn to build a Level 4 Cosmic Translocator. For now, I should focus on mastering the construction of a one-way Cosmic Translocator," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cosmic Translocators are divided into two types, one of which is two-way. For people to teleport to a certain place, that place must also have the same Cosmic Translocator to enable the teleportation, essentially traveling from one Cosmic Translocator to another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's the case most of the time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the Racial Convergence Planet, almost every city has a Cosmic Translocator, allowing teleportation between them. This kind of teleportation consumes less energy and is highly accurate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the coordinates are set, items will be teleported there without any deviation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there's also a one-way Cosmic Translocator,</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A one-way Cosmic Translocator doesn't require the other side to have a Cosmic Translocator and can still perform teleportation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it has many drawbacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, building a one-way Cosmic Translocator is more complex, it consumes more energy for the same distance, and it can only teleport to an approximate coordinate range, often resulting in the final location being far from the intended target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, one-way translocators are all drawbacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only advantage is that it can be used anywhere without needing to locate another Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne feels he needs to learn how to build a one-way Cosmic Translocator because the reason he&rsquo;s learning to build it is to escape farther when running for his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he can't build a one-way Cosmic Translocator, he won't be able to teleport if there are no other Cosmic Translocators nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A one-way Cosmic Translocator is more like interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He can travel wherever he wants without needing anyone's cooperation, just over longer distances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "A one-way Cosmic Translocator is more complex than a two-way one, but not too hard. I've already mastered building a two-way Cosmic Translocator, so learning to build a one-way translocator won't be difficult."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I still have two months, and I must at least learn to build a level-one one-way Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne immersed himself in learning again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two months flew by in the blink of an eye, and Osborne finally mastered the construction of the one-way Cosmic Translocator at the last moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the door was knocked on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela said, "Osborne, come out quickly! The Phantomagic Realm seems to be appearing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately stopped studying and walked out of the room. "The Phantomagic Realm is appearing? Where?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"See for yourself!" Angela pointed above her head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately looked over, then a look of surprise appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the starry sky, far away, a massive dimensional rift suddenly appeared, even much larger than the entire Inferno Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, dense black mist continuously surged from the dimensional rift, spreading across the void to form a sea of black fog, rapidly expanding outward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the sea of dark fog covered half of the starry sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the Phantomagic Realm?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He found it somewhat unbelievable; that dimensional rift was simply too massive. Osborne could also tear open space to create a dimensional rift with ease, but even if he fully exerted his spatial power, the rift he created wouldn't be one ten-thousandth the size of this one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Inferno Planet could fit into that dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What kind of power could tear open such a massive dimensional rift?" Osborne wondered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he used such power to attack, it could probably shatter a massive life-bearing planet like Inferno Planet in an instant, making it vanish into the cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone on Inferno Planet would probably die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At least warriors above the level of Imperial Empyrean Sacredness could unleash such power!" he thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela and Agatha were equally shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stared at the sea of black mist, where all kinds of things suddenly appeared&mdash;massive fierce beasts, eerie creatures, and glowing celestial bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the massive dimensional rift began to slowly disappear, leaving only a sea of black mist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And everything within the black mist sea vanished, hidden within the fog.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Phantomagic Realm has taken shape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the entire Inferno Planet was in great commotion. Sacred Artifact warships from various cities soared into the sky, rushing toward the Phantomagic Realm in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Charge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Phantomagic Realm has appeared!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Phantomagic Realm will only stay for one month. After one month, it will disappear into the dimensional rift again, and no one knows where it will appear next!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is our chance! Speed up, charge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For the Dragon Elixir, charge!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
