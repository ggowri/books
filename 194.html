  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" a burly man called out from behind Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp wave of his hand, six figures emerged from the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of dark light enveloped them, and they vanished from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa, what's that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that some sort of invisibility power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened as he observed through his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up, Mr. Augustine?" Valentin asked urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly explained, and Valentin's face fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo has someone who can turn invisible? This is terrible! They could get close without us even noticing. We need to pull back our scouts or they'll be in serious danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, slightly reassured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry too much. Their invisibility isn't perfect. I can still track them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's face brightened with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can track them? That's great! Let's set a trap. We'll lure them in and deal with them before they get too close."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good. Just give me a sniper rifle and I'll guide you to their location."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin handed over a Class B sniper rifle and hurried off to set the trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the viewing platform, everyone was closely watching the unfolding battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not everyone could make out the action in the pitch-black night, but the Chevalier family had anticipated this. To showcase Chevalier Security's strength and their strategy to defeat Skyefall Security, they'd arranged several helicopters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These helicopters were equipped with night-vision cameras, capturing every moment of the battle in the canyon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa watched intently, her nerves on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Clarissa, Barlyn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cheerful voice called from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa turned and smiled as she saw Austin. "Austin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin, the heiress of the influential Montague family, was a close friend of Barlyn and a confidante of Clarissa. Of course, she wouldn't miss out on such an exciting event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe," Austin greeted Donna with a respectful nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna smiled warmly. "Austin, it's been a while. Why don't you come join us for the match?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin nodded but didn't immediately head to the viewing area. Instead, she scanned the bodyguards around Clarissa with a look of concern and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned closer to Barlyn and whispered, "Barlyn, where's Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn looked around, puzzled. "He was just here. Where did he go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa jumped in, "Osborne had to leave for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, she asked Austin, "You seem to know Osborne pretty well. Why are you looking for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's face turned slightly pink as she recalled the awkward situation where she'd asked Osborne to help her get pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly tried to downplay it. "Oh, it's nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just had a drink together once or twice. But you seem pretty interested in him. Everything okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa blushed as well, choosing to sidestep the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Osborne's saved my life before, so of course I'm concerned about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's focus on the fight," Clarissa said, shifting her attention back to the canyon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She soon spotted Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the disguise, she recognized him instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, stay safe!" Clarissa whispered, clutching her fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna interrupted with a serious tone, "Chevalier Security is moving fast. They've already got the flag. Now they just need to break through Skyefall Security's defenses to win. Skyefall Security, however, is playing it smart by holding strong defensive positions instead of confronting Chevalier Security head-on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression suddenly shifted to alarm. "Wait a minute. Did I just see what I think I saw? Chevalier Security has invisibility power? Six of their members have disappeared from view! Even night vision and thermal sensors can't detect them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Skyefall Security is in serious trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped as they watched six members of Chevalier Security disappear without a trace. Invisibility powers were rare, but an ability that could cloak an entire squad was practically unheard of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this kind of intense flag battle, having that kind of edge was a game-changer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could see the danger now. If Skyefall Security got ambushed by these invisible foes, they could be taken down fast, and this could easily turn the tide of the whole match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek, watching from the sidelines, wore a confident grin as if victory was already in the bag.</span></p><div class="pagination">
