  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, he directly drew the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his current strength, none of the Zone Duel contestants mattered to him, including the championship favorite, Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he didn't use the Solar Sacred Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne only used a small portion of Sacred Power to activate the Bloodwrought Bow, forming a Sacred Power Arrow that locked onto the man opposite him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, the terrifying Sacred Power fluctuations and aura still startled the man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh no, I underestimated his strength a bit!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That shield's defense is so strong! It blocked my attack so easily! And his arrow, it hasn't even been shot yet, but it's already giving me so much pressure?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man clenched his lips. "But if you want to defeat me, it won't be that easy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, he also wielded a Sacred Artifact shield in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "Osborne, don't celebrate too soon! I was just testing you earlier. Even if you can block it, that means nothing! Next, I will show my true strength..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed, "Too bad, you no longer have the chance to show it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he directly released the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a whoosh, the Sacred Power Arrow shot out, reaching the man in the blink of an eye, blocked by the Sacred Power shield he controlled. But the next second, a terrifying force erupted. The defense of the Sacred Artifact shield was instantly destroyed. The arrow deflected it and relentlessly struck the man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spat out a mouthful of blood. The Sacred Power Arrow effortlessly pierced through his abdomen, bringing forth a spray of blood and fragments of internal organs, then vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked down at his abdomen, which had a large hole, his face full of confusion. He struggled to lift his head, looking at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Have I lost just like this?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I&rsquo;m the third-place winner of Yoresia State, and among all the participants in the zone duel, my strength is definitely above average. And yet, have I lost just like this?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I couldn't even block a single move from Osborne?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man spat out another mouthful of blood and collapsed. He felt incredibly weak, his life force rapidly fading away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, someone in the crowd unleashed their strength and pulled him back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, a few skilled in healing quickly treated him, stopping his life force from draining further, but they struggled to heal his wounds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left them all extremely shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Sacred Power was a fusion of five different forces, including his fire elemental essence. Moreover, he ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame, which carried an incredibly terrifying corrosive power within its flames.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, his Sacred Power also possessed a terrifying corrosive force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Osborne had done his best to suppress the eruption of this corrosive power, the wounds of those injured by him would still be difficult to heal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, he didn't intend to kill that man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, perhaps only the judges of advanced Empyrean Sacredness could save him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a cold snort sounded. Brenda stared at Osborne and said coldly, "Osborne, you're too ruthless! He was just sparring with you, yet you injured him so severely. If we didn't have someone skilled in healing, he might have even died!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're too brutal!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, everyone nodded in agreement, glaring at Osborne with immense anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled faintly, "Brutal, ruthless? Say what you want! In my view, he's just weak and overestimated himself by provoking me! If he hadn't provoked me, how would he have gotten hurt?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne angrily glared at everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Who else among you is dissatisfied with me like him? If you're not afraid of being seriously injured like him and having your results canceled, then go ahead and make your move!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, waiting for the Cosmic Translocator to be fixed is boring. I don't mind playing with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's words instantly made everyone even angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're so arrogant!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, who do you think you are? How dare you talk to us like that? Do you think you're invincible? Ridiculous. Let me teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, another man stepped forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at him, a bit surprised. He knew this man; he was also a strong contender for the top ten and seemed to be a state duel champion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is he really not afraid of being disqualified?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn&rsquo;t care. He said, &ldquo;You want to teach me a lesson? Then come on! I just hope you&rsquo;re not as weak as the last guy, making me worry I might accidentally kill you all!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, the man became even angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all the contestants were stunned by Osborne's arrogant and domineering words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's also a state duel champion!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He is a strong contender for the top ten, but Osborne doesn&rsquo;t care about him and even worries that his weakness might lead to accidentally killing him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How dare he! He's just too arrogant!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all the contestants thought Osborne was bragging.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance, cold smirks on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among everyone present, perhaps only the two of them truly knew how strong Osborne was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>State duel champion?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A strong contender for the top ten?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wa</span><span>s he really that strong?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">His strength is average, yet he came to provoke Osborne. He's simply courting death! Perhaps Osborne really has to worry about accidentally killing him and will desperately hold back his power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they weren't worried about Osborne at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The referees in the distance were also surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne's strength is quite impressive! I thought even if he could win, it would take him quite some time! However, he defeated his opponent with just one arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"His opponent wasn't weak! Plus, the power of that arrow was incredible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The referees were discussing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, he's too arrogant, completely disregarding others. He'll become the target of everyone! This time, his opponent is a strong contender for the top ten, even more powerful. Among all the participants, his strength can at least rank in the top fifty."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne is in trouble now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, he might have to give it his all to possibly win! Maybe he'll lose."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The referees made their judgment again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the man had already made his move. His Sacred Power was clearly stronger, having fused three types of power. The Sacred Artifact in his hand was also mid-grade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder he could win the state championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, his attack landed on Osborne's Warfare Shield and was still easily blocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned. Just as he was about to speak, he noticed Osborne had already drawn the bowstring and unhesitatingly shot a Sacred Power Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Power Arrow reached him in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't panic. Although Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow was powerful, he had a Mid-grade Defensive Sacred Artifact. Blocking it wouldn't be a problem at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, he was terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow easily smashed through his Mid-grade Defensive Sacred Artifact, shattered his defense, and pierced through his abdomen in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large amount of his blood, mixed with fragments of his organs, was carried out of his body by the Sacred Power Arrow. He felt his body go limp and collapsed in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A state duel champion was defeated by Osborne with a single arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the surroundings fell completely silent. Those who had been shouting moments ago were now staring in shock with wide eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
