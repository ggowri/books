  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa suddenly appeared in front of the trio, her hand reaching out to grasp the terrifying lightning charged by Maddox's Hammer of Thor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle squeeze, the fearsome lightning vanished into thin air, as if it had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence enveloped the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood frozen, mouths agape, staring at Isa's striking figure, their faces painted with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Maddox's expression hardened dramatically, disbelief etched across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is that possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa ignored his incredulity and turned to Clarissa and the others. "You're no match for him. Take a breather; I'll handle this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They bit their lips with frustration evident in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was filled with worry and blurted out, "Isa, your real match should be Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, "I know! But until I take care of this guy from Racial Convergence Planet, Lord Malevolence won't show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I misjudged the strength of his ally; I didn't expect him to be an Ascension Nine warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's beyond what you can handle, so let me take over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift wave of her hand, Clarissa and the others vanished from their spot, reappearing safely within the protective confines of the Sanctum of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched Isa with grave expressions, guilt weighing heavily on their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa declared, her tone shifting to one of seriousness, "Alright, warm-up's over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maddox, right? You're not my match, so step aside and let Lord Malevolence come out personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's anger flared at her words. "You arrogant woman! What gives you the nerve to say that? You think I don't know? You're just an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King too! How do you plan to defeat me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa remained unfazed and said calmly, "If you don't believe me, then let's settle this. I'll take you down in three moves! If I can't, I'll just walk away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox was infuriated, his face twisting in rage. "Defeat me in three moves? Hahaha! I've never met anyone so full of themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even on the Racial Convergence Planet, among those at the same level as me, only a handful could beat me in three moves. And you, a native from the Human Community on Celestara Planet, you're country bumpkin. You actually claim you can beat me in three moves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Since you're asking for death, I'll grant your wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he wildly swung the Hammer of Thor, summoning a storm of lightning. The sky darkened as countless bolts rained down, converging on his hammer, which glowed with an intense purple light, resembling a sun of pure electricity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me show you what I'm really capable of! Divine Thunder Execution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox brought the Hammer of Thor crashing down, unleashing a torrent of lightning that surged toward Isa like a raging river, moving at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything in its path shattered, turning to ash and charred debris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An otherworldly dread unfurled across the universe. The sheer, raw power was so overwhelming that it sent shivers down spines from a staggering distance of millions of miles. The world went deathly still. Amidst the enveloping darkness, there was but one sole beacon: a jagged bolt of lightning, a tempestuous ribbon of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Utterly petrifying! Brutally overpowering!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Human Alliance gasped, their faces paling as they watched Isa, worry etched in their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew Isa was the disciple of the God of Night and his woman, boasting immense power&mdash;stronger than many of the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But can Isa really handle someone as formidable as Maddox?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even the God of Night himself would struggle against him, wouldn't he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, every member of the Human Community held their breath, their hearts racing. With the God of Night absent, Isa stood as their strongest warrior, and their hopes rested on her shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isa were to fall, then the Human Community would be doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Maddox unleashed his terrifying lightning, Isa stood there, utterly calm. She seemed to float in the void, showing no signs of defense or evasion, as if she hadn't even noticed Maddox's attack&mdash;or perhaps she was too stunned to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the crackling bolts were about to strike her, Isa finally moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs bent slightly, then propelled her upward as she launched a kick straight at the oncoming lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's foot appeared almost insignificant compared to the massive, menacing lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone would think that if the lightning made contact, her foot would disintegrate into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was far from the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The menacing thunderbolts, upon being struck by Isa's foot, simply shattered. In an instant, all their once-fierce power reversed its course, swirling back in a chaotic maelstrom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive footprint materialized in the air, swirling with the remnants of the lightning, and shot back toward Maddox with tremendous force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox was left in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His full-powered attack had just been obliterated by a single kick from Isa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The residual lightning even spiraled back, merging with Isa's strike as it barreled toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox was reeling from the shock, but there was no time to ponder. Sensing the danger of Isa's blow, he unleashed all his strength, summoning layers of lightning in front of him to block her attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, the lightning shattered, and Isa's footprint slammed into Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox felt as if every bone in his body was shattering, blood spewing from his mouth as he was sent flying backward, crashing into the ground with a tremendous impact that created a massive crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no different from when Isa had kicked Ricky away before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming quiet fell over the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Isa had claimed she would defeat Maddox in three moves, nearly everyone had thought she was just boasting. No one believed she could actually pull it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Maddox had displayed such terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King was already at the peak of the pyramid on Celestara Planet. Many believed that even the God of Night would struggle to defeat Maddox in this situation, let alone do it in three moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the disciple of the God of Night, Isa, no matter how strong, couldn't possibly surpass him, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, no one had high hopes for Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the result left them all in shock. Isa hadn't needed three moves; with just one kick, she had shattered Maddox's full-force attack and sent him flying, leaving him gravely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such power left everyone present astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Human Alliance, momentarily forgetting to cheer, stood dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bowin, you're incredible! Look, that's my teacher!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Zoe was bursting with excitement. Watching Isa unleash her might, Zoe felt even more thrilled than if she had personally defeated Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A furious roar erupted as a battered Maddox charged forward, blood still trickling from his mouth, his eyes burning with rage and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly couldn't accept that he had been defeated in one </span><span>blow by someone of his own rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox was desperate to rush at Isa for a rematch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a figure appeared in front of him, calm and composed. "Maddox, you're no match for her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's someone I'll deal with personally!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, an eerie silence fell around them, followed by a chorus of gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence! He's here!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
