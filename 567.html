  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The raging purple-gold lightning finally subsided, leaving behind a colossal crater where Rodney once stood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pit was charred black by the lightning, with streams of molten magma seeping out from its depths.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the very bottom of the pit lay a tall, charred figure. Its body was in tatters and covered with ghastly, scorched wounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, it still breathed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Rodney Augustine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the branch bloodline from Norlend cried out in alarm and rushed over frantically, lifting Rodney, who had fainted and was barely breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They glared at Osborne with fury. Their eyes were burning with a desire to devour him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at the same time, fear flickered within their gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne not only possessed mutated Thunder Power but had also mastered the intermediate application&mdash;Thunder Explosion. With a single move, he had gravely injured Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Had Rodney not prepared a fourth-level defensive ancient magic weapon and activated it in time, he would likely be dead now. His body might be blown to pieces by the horrific Thunder Explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, everyone from Norlend loathed and feared Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney had made extensive preparations for this Branch Bloodline Competition, aiming to stand out and become the prospective heir of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he succeeded, the entire branch bloodline from Norlend would be immensely honored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, everything had been ruined by Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney's injuries were so severe that he had fainted. He was eliminated and withdrew from the competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the competition continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne moved with a suddenness that caught everyone off guard. His blood-red hair surged forth like a tide, swiftly entangling a member from Norlend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This person was holding the Forbidden Space Disk in his hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Concerned about Rodney's condition, the man never expected Osborne to launch a surprise attack, let alone that Osborne's assault would be so peculiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the blink of an eye, Osborne employed his blood-red hair to ensnare the man tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Forbidden Space Disk in his hand was also wrapped in the blood-red hair and quickly returned to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the Forbidden Space Disk in his grasp, Osborne showed a hearty smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's over!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne murmured, "I declare that the battle for the heir-to-be is now concluded."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne dispelled the power on the Forbidden Space Disk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the frozen space returned to normal. Osborne could even sense the spatial fluctuations clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Waving his hand, he suddenly felt dense space cracks appear around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne casually tossed the Forbidden Space Disk into the Dimensional Space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Done!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Witnessing this scene, the onlookers shared the same thought. The only device capable of restraining Osborne's spatial power was now beyond their reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The frozen space was restored, so Osborne could depart at will, unhindered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam looked terrifyingly gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam clenched his fists. His gaze upon Osborne was one of a predator denied its prey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne met his gaze without flinching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled faintly and said, "Sam, do you still wish to continue this fight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam snorted but said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Continue fighting?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne possessed spatial power. If victory eluded him, Osborne could escape at any moment. The most critical point was that even without his spatial prowess, Osborne was not a foe I could easily overcome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Thunder Explosion posed a grave threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If his target had been me instead of Rodney...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even with my robust defenses, it was uncertain whether I could stand unscathed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, how could I fight under such circumstances?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's eyes reddened as he helplessly stared at the Heir's Emblem adorning Osborne's chest. Though Sam had allies at his side, they were rendered useless in the face of Osborne's prowess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam closed his eyes, finally conceding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems you have no desire to continue, so I shall take my leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly and walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His departure was unimpeded by the seething crowd who dared not act without Sam's command. They parted reluctantly, allowing Osborne to depart step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Osborne was about to vanish, Sam's voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne turned, a faint smile playing on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Do you regret your decision? Do you still wish to fight against me? I am unopposed. I stand ready to engage you at any time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam felt ridiculous at these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He snorted, "Osborne, do not be too arrogant! Today, I can admit defeat, but this is not the end! You have stolen my position as the heir-to-be, so I will not rest until I reclaim what is rightfully mine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Moreover, you have killed David and gravely injured Rodney. The branch bloodline from Ransford and Norlend will revenge what you did!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Most importantly, even if you ascend to the position of quasi-heir, what good will it do you? The strength of your branch in Dampston is too feeble! Even if you become the heir-to-be, you stand no chance against the other five contenders. In the end, your aspirations will come to nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you are wise, you should renounce your claim to the heir-to-be and surrender the emblem to me! Only then can I promise to absolve you of your troubles!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The branch bloodline of Marcelin possesses the power to make this promise a reality!"</p><div class="pagination">
