  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar stood tall, brimming with confidence, as the black vortex above his head continued to spin wildly, growing larger with each rotation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its terrifying power felt as if it could swallow everything in its path, casting a shadow over the entire arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Caesar's mind, this formidable technique had taken shape, and he was certain that Osborne and his companions were trembling in fear, ready to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when he caught sight of their expressions, he was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were unnervingly calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if they were oblivious to the menacing vortex above them, allowing it to form and gather strength without a hint of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed they didn't regard his attack as a real threat at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's going on here?" A sense of unease crept into Caesar's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, feeling the vortex had amassed enough power, he quickly regained his composure and let out a scoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you trying to play it cool?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're all so foolish for not acting immediately to interrupt my technique! Your hesitation has given me ample time to gather strength! Now, my attack is primed, and once it falls, your defeat is inevitable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't kid yourselves; the so-called Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings&mdash;just me, Caesar, can take you all down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One strike is all it will take!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that declaration, confidence radiated from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce and Kendra joined in, laughter bubbling up as Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Diana, and Hannah also found it hard to contain their amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce smirked, saying, "You sure can talk a big game! Does your dad know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, Caesar, you think you can take us down with just this one move? I've got to say, that's adorably naive! If you're so confident, let's see you drop it! We haven't interrupted you because we figured it would just waste your divine power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shrugged nonchalantly after his remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar's expression darkened. "What do you mean? You think you can withstand my attack? Do you even know what this technique is called? Do you understand how powerful it is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! Good one!" Bryce and the others laughed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't respond but turned their attention to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a calm smile, Osborne said, "Caesar, your 'Dark Whirl of Oblivion' is impressive! To have it reach such a scale in such a short time&mdash;kudos to you, a late-stage Deity King. Even I couldn't pull that off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If that Dark Whirl of Oblivion were to fall, a typical mid-stage Deity King wouldn't stand a chance! But here's the kicker&mdash;it won't drop in front of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, disdain flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I abandoned that technique long ago! The time it takes to gather enough energy is just too slow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dark Whirl of Oblivion? You actually know about it? How is that possible? Have you mastered it, too? That can't be! This move is the Eldridge family's signature technique! Only super talents like me, taught by the esteemed Lord Malevolence, could ever wield it! How could you possibly know? Did you hear about it somewhere? Trying to scare me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was a storm of anger and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged casually. "Think what you want! I'm not here to explain myself. But I'll give you a piece of advice&mdash;don't use dark power in front of me; otherwise, you're going to regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne certainly didn't take the Dark Whirl of Oblivion forming above his head seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had mastered that technique long ago, back when he broke through to Level Five of dark elemental essence&mdash;even before he had reached Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was intimately familiar with the intricacies of the Dark Whirl of Oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he had abandoned it because its execution was too slow, requiring far too much time to gather enough power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne had access to a host of more powerful dark power techniques at his disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But clearly, Caesar didn't buy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a scowl, he spat. "If you're looking for death, I'll gladly oblige! Dark Whirl of Oblivion, crush them mercilessly! Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Caesar's furious roar echoed through the arena, the massive black vortex above them began to spin even faster, descending rapidly towards Osborne and the others. The oppressive force of the attack bore down on them, suffocating in its intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those watching from a distance could feel the chaotic and terrifying power of the Dark Whirl of Oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, Osborne and his companions remained unfazed, their expressions calm and collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head slightly, a hint of amusement in his voice. "I told you, this move won't work on me. It... won't drop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he raised a finger and gently pointed at the swirling vortex above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the descending black vortex halted mid-air, still spinning wildly but unable to move any lower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar's face paled in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He realized, with growing horror, that he had lost control of the Dark Whirl of Oblivion!</span></p><div class="pagination">
