  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arch announced, "Letitia from the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Age test: passed! Cultivation level: Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, primary elemental power: fire elemental!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire elemental energy intensity: Class A!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Overall score&mdash;Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp echoed through the arena as the Sylvan Elf Clan royals&mdash;five princes and three princesses&mdash;rose to their feet in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes widened in disbelief as they processed the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them exclaimed, "Class S overall score?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, Chuck, claim Letitia from Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Chuck, Joanna's brother and the only Ascension Six Supernal Deity King among the Sylvan royals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His excitement was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a Class S score, even an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King was more than enough to qualify for his exploration team. He wouldn't trade it for three Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings with Class A scores!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chuck, you're already incredibly powerful. Why not let us have her instead?" another prince chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Sylvan Sovereign Badge gleamed with his name: Crispin Edmund.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, he felt he had a strong case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chuck, Crispin, I think you should let her join my team! Sure, she's got a Class S score, but she's still just an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King. She'd fit perfectly in my squad!" another voice added, eager to stake a claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not so fast! She'd be better off with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the eight Sylvan Elf Clan royals began to bicker over Letitia, each vying for her attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, Letitia stood there, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been confident about her performance in the Astral Testing Arch; after all, her talents had always surpassed those of her brother Jaden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Jaden could score Class C, she had expected at least Class C as well, perhaps even a shot at Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, her score was Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the ongoing assessments for the six Elf Royal Families, thousands of talented individuals had passed through the Astral Testing Arch, yet none had achieved a score higher than Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Class A scores was already scarce, with fewer than a hundred candidates reaching that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, here she was, with a Class S score?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia was in a daze, overwhelmed by the frenzy of Sylvan Elf Clan royals clamoring for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jaden, watching from the sidelines, was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Letitia was more gifted than he was, but he never imagined the gap would be this wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he felt satisfied with his Class C score, Letitia's Class S left him in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did a Class S score even mean? Jaden wasn't sure, but the excitement and urgency radiating from the Sylvan royals made it clear that it was something extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, the news of Letitia's Class S score spread like wildfire, catching the attention of other Royal Families. They paused their own assessments, rushing over to join the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Letitia from the Human Community, how about joining our Thunder Elf Clan's exploration team?" one royal offered eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Letitia from the Human Community, come join us at the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Letitia from the Human Community, we extend an invitation from the Storm Elf Clan Royal Family! Whatever your requests, just let us know, and we'll do our best to accommodate you! We promise to ensure your safety once we enter Umbra Earth..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Letitia from the Human Community, we at the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family can guarantee that as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Letitia from the Human Community..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, members from the other Elf Royal Families began hurling offers at Letitia, eager to recruit her, and the very atmosphere became charged with competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sylvan Elf Clan princes and princesses, caught in their squabble, quickly exchanged worried glances and ceased their bickering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck scoffed, saying, "What are you all thinking? Thunder Elf Clan, Fire Elf Clan, and Storm Elf Clan&mdash;we're the ones who hosted the assessment</span><span> here</span><span>! She's passed and is joining our Sylvan Elf Clan exploration team. What gives you the right to poach her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step aside, unless you want to see what I'm really capable of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flourish, Chuck unleashed the full brunt of his Ascension Six Supernal Deity King power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others flinched, their faces paling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strongest among them was only an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, and they knew they couldn't contend with Chuck's sheer presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, their eyes lingered on Letitia, unwilling to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone retorted, "Ha! Don't think you can intimidate us with your cultivation level, Chuck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, she registered with you for the assessment, but that doesn't mean she has to join your team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She has every right to choose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another chimed in, "Exactly, she has the right to choose which exploration team to join! Are you Sylvan Elf Clan going to force her to join only yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! Letitia from Human Community, don't hesitate! You can pick whichever team you want!" chimed a third.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the three major Elf Royal Families uniting against him, the pressure mounted on Chuck and the Sylvan Elf Clan's Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, they declared, "Let's leave it to Letitia to decide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to Letitia, and she felt the weight of their gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxiety crept in as she contemplated, then finally said, "I want to join my brother and his wife in the same exploration team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A royal responded eagerly, "Absolutely no problem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your brother's Class C score is commendable! Although his wife's Class D is a bit on the low side, it's still respectable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can definitely join my exploration team with them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should she join your team? She belongs in mine!" another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not so fast! She's coming with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Join us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, dozens of princes and princesses from various Elf Royal Families began to squabble again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief discussion, Letitia and Jaden huddled together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, they reached a decision. "We want to join Prince Chuck's exploration team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck, the only Ascension Six Supernal Deity King in the room, was the most powerful among the royals present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joining his team would boost their chances significantly in Umbra Earth, not to mention Sylvan Elf Clan had a reputation for being the most easygoing of them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck's face broke into a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fantastic! Welcome aboard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't promise you the moon, but I'll do my best to keep you safe while we're in Umbra Earth. If any treasures come our way, you'll get your fair share&mdash;I won't shortchange you, I swear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, joy filled Letitia's heart, and she felt her brother's pride beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the other princes and princesses, disappointed by the outcome, couldn't suppress their chagrin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the big deal with a Class S score? When we actually get to Umbra Earth, who knows how useful it'll be," one muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right? She's only got an Ascension Four cultivation level. What can she do?" another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get back to our assessments&mdash;who knows? We might just stumble upon another Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, we might even encounter individuals with Class S ratings who possess Ascension Five or even Ascension Six strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the other royal family members departed, Desmond found himself among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite a sense of regret, he suddenly spotted Osborne in the crowd.</span></p><div class="pagination">
