  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the God of Time was in a state of frenzy, her pale face devoid of color, her eyes betraying a flicker of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, her distress went largely unnoticed, as nearly everyone was captivated by the trio of Clarissa, Emma, and Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This included Anastasia and Zoe, who were equally spellbound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Clarissa!" Anastasia exclaimed, her eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled to process the revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Clarissa is the reincarnation of the Goddess of Fate?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia knew that Emma and Austin were linked to Osborne, but to learn that one was the God of Death's reincarnation and the other the Goddess of Life's was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all part of the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, on the other hand, was equally stunned, though her focus remained fixed on Isa, her expression a mix of disbelief and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, she called out, "Ms. Bowin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa turned at the sound of her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Zoe, she nodded gently, smiling. "Zoe, it's good to see you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's heart swelled with emotion. "Ms. Bowin, I've missed you so much! I really, really have!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Zoe, aside from Osborne and Anastasia, Isa was the closest person in her life. Isa had guided her on her path to cultivation and helped her unlock her potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Isa left Blue Planet, Zoe was just a little girl, and now, after more than twenty years apart, the reunion felt surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting her lip, Zoe longed to rush into Isa's arms and weep, but she knew better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Isa was the formidable Maddox, and charging in would only be a distraction, a liability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bowin, please be careful!" Zoe managed to call out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded reassuringly. "Don't worry! I'll be just fine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all need to look after yourselves too; a great battle is about to unfold! After this fight, the grievances between the Human Community of Celestara Planet and the invading Paramount Supreme Clan will be settled once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa's gaze hardened, her eyes cold and filled with battle intent as she turned her attention to Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox scoffed, arms crossed, his demeanor relaxed. "Hold your horses! Let's see how this plays out first. I've heard Zayne mention a few remarkable talents from the Human Community, ones who caused him quite a bit of trouble. They're known as the Seven Great Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I've heard they're nearly extinct, with only the God of Night and the God of Light left. I was a bit disappointed, but now, seeing them return from reincarnation after just a thousand years... it's quite the stroke of luck! It's rare to find anyone who can come back with their memories intact, even on Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let me see if they truly deserve Zayne's praise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Maddox settled back, clearly enjoying the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Maddox wasn't in a rush to attack, Isa said calmly, "I trust you won't be disappointed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She prepared to watch the unfolding drama, while Clarissa, Emma, and Austin faced off against Ricky and his six companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one Ascension Eight and six Ascension Seven warriors against them, the trio exchanged glances, their expressions filled with excitement rather than fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been brought from Blue Planet to Celestara Planet by Isa, and after awakening their memories, they had spent time in the Sanctum of Night, honing their skills and regaining their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been far too long since they had engaged in real combat, and the thrill of battle surged through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's stepping up first?" Clarissa asked, her voice brimming with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma chuckled, "Come on, Clarissa, your fate power isn't exactly known for its combat prowess. Why don't you hang back and let me take the lead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shot her a playful glare. "Who says my fate power can't hold its own in a fight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least I could take you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma laughed. "Alright, alright! You're so awesome! Since you're even more badass, then it's even more reason for me to step up! You're stronger than me, so shouldn't you let me deal with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa rolled her eyes, exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin chimed in, a grin on her face, "Hey, you two, I'm the weakest among us. Let me take a crack at it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" Both Clarissa and Emma shot back in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your life power isn't cut out for battle! You need to stay in the back and focus on healing us. Remember what happened a thousand years ago? You got taken out first, and we ended up in a world of hurt because of it! This time, you just need to keep our life force up and help us recover!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they both shot Austin a stern look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit put out, Austin sighed but nodded reluctantly under their watchful gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Alright, I'll do what you say!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ricky let out a cold snort, his face twisted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt utterly disrespected by the trio's banter. "You three should just attack together! Otherwise, I might not enjoy this as much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three women turned to face him, their expressions turning icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma stepped forward, her voice dripping with disdain. "You think you're worthy of facing all three of us? I'll take you on myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma charged ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa felt a mix of helplessness and regret wash over her as she suppressed her own battle instincts. "Emma, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma nodded confidently. "I'm good! If things get dicey, I'll call for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded back, though worry creased her brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky's anger flared. "You little brat, you're asking for death! You think you can take us on alone? You're just an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King! Even on Racial Convergence Planet, not many Ascension Seven warriors would dare claim to be my equal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're looking to die, I'll gladly oblige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ricky sprang into action, and Tyrese along with his five companions hesitated for just a moment before launching their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's take her down fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show this Celestara Planet brat that Mystic Sirius Sect's disciples are not to be underestimated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the battle erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, Ricky unleashed a terrifying wave of power, sending a torrent of energy crashing toward Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyrese and the other six Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings followed suit, each unleashing their most lethal attacks to overwhelm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Emma remained steadfast, utterly unfazed by the approaching threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across her face as her eyes glimmered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar that reverberated through the air, she bellowed, "Death's Stare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a sharp, buzzing sound filled the atmosphere, like the ominous hum of a venomous insect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Emma, a colossal, pale eye materialized out of thin air, its surface crisscrossed with sinister crimson veins that pulsed with otherworldly energy. An aura of pure dread emanated from it, as if it were a portal to the darkest recesses of the underworld. The eye then unleashed a bone-chilling beam of light, a frigid stream that swept forward like a relentless tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It enveloped the oncoming attacks with ease, each ray of light seeming to carry with it the promise of doom. It was as if a harbinger of the apocalypse had been summoned. And then, the unimaginable finally occurred.</span></p><div class="pagination">
