  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched as Fabian launched his attack, feeling the overwhelming power and speed radiating from the Deity Overlord. A heavy seriousness settled over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just as I thought, a Deity Overlord truly is a force to be reckoned with. This divine power is something Celestial Deities can't even dream of matching!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if speed is supposed to be Fabian's weakness, he's still incredibly fast&mdash;no ordinary Celestial Deity warrior could hope to dodge that punch! If I hadn't upgraded my lightning elemental essence and mastered Thunderform Flash, I wouldn't dare to take him on directly; I'd have to rely on spatial power to evade!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of electricity flickered in Osborne's eyes as his body became enveloped in crackling energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunderform Flash was activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Fabian's fist was about to connect with Osborne, he transformed into a bolt of lightning, vanishing from sight in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's fist slammed into nothingness, obliterating only the illusion of Osborne left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deity Overlord's expression hardened in an instant as he retracted the divine power from his punch, realizing the danger he posed to the entire slave market if he continued his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that fleeting moment, it showcased Fabian's remarkable control over his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his face darkened as he spun around, searching for the real Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, a flash of lightning came to a halt, revealing Osborne standing confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk appeared on his face as he locked eyes with Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all you've got, Fabian? You thought you could turn me into mush with a single punch? Are you some kind of crippled old lady? You're so slow that I could tie my legs together and you still wouldn't catch me. How do you plan to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's taunt hung in the air, a stunned silence enveloped the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Osborne in disbelief, their expressions a mix of shock and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's furious attack had been dodged! And so effortlessly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Fabian really that slow? Was he truly moving at a pace that could be compared to a disabled old woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was simply impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the onlookers didn't believe they could have evaded Fabian's punch, not even those at Calvin's level, the peak of Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew the Wild Bull Clan's weaknesses lay in their speed and agility, but Fabian was a Deity Overlord warrior. Even if he was slower compared to other Deity Overlords, he was still faster than most Celestial Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, effortlessly dodging his attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, they had thought Osborne was as good as dead, certain that Fabian would fulfill his promise and turn Osborne into a bloody mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as they listened to Osborne's mocking words directed at Fabian, they felt as if they had been slapped in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Calvin was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did he get such speed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He transformed into lightning to dodge Fabian's attack! I couldn't even pull that off! How strange&mdash;didn't he give up on training Thunder Power ages ago? How did he suddenly pick it back up and become this strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin furrowed his brow, increasingly perplexed by his nephew "Lachlan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian roared, his face flushed with anger, "You're going to regret this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've surprised me! But do you really think that's enough to stand against me? You're being naive! I will kill you today, and no number of tricks will save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Oh really? Then bring it on! Let's see how this 'crippled old lady' of yours tries to catch me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's face turned crimson with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a Deity Overlord warrior, not some doddering old woman! I will destroy you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Fabian charged forward again, his fury fueling his next attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian unleashed an explosion of divine power, more ferocious and formidable than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he vanished from sight, leaving behind a flickering afterimage, and reappeared right in front of Osborne, launching a devastating punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he was at least twice as fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, it still wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never underestimated a Deity Overlord warrior. Though he appeared calm, every muscle in his body was taut, and the moment Fabian moved, he deployed Thunderform Flash once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His caution paid off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crack of energy filled the air as Osborne narrowly dodged Fabian's punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the residual divine power from the attack grazed him, striking him with a powerful blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne's formidable divine power defense shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This attack was far stronger than anything he had faced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Osborne managed to evade the worst of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't, a direct hit from Fabian&mdash;especially now&mdash;would have left him severely injured, even with his Divine Body at Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he still hadn't landed a hit on Osborne only fueled Fabian's rage further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He charged at Osborne once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two figures moved with lightning speed, weaving and darting around each other in a frenetic dance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian sneered, gritting his teeth. "You slippery little vermin from the Human Community! I underestimated you, but how long can you keep this up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Using that kind of speed must cost you a lot of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sooner or later, you'll run out of juice, and when that happens... You're dead meat!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
