  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community, in terms of both numbers and strength, actually falls short compared to the other races!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's thanks to the great and beautiful God of Light that we can acquire powerful divine artifacts at a reasonable price. This allows us to stand our ground against the Dark Deity Legion on the battlefield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might think a Sanctum Level Light Airship is pricey, but that's only because it's top-tier and in very limited supply. If they didn't charge high prices for them, they wouldn't even have enough to sell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aside from those elite divine artifacts, many others aren't as expensive. For instance, an Ultimate Light Airship, complete with a divine power shield and main and secondary cannons capable of threatening Deity King warriors, costs only about 100 million Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most first-rate forces, and even second-rate ones, can manage to scrape together enough to buy an Ultimate Light Airship if they really push for it. We purchased two Ultimate Light Airships. If it weren't for those, we wouldn't have held out as long on the battlefield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In summary, the weapons and equipment sold by the Sanctum of Light's top-tier offerings are generally only affordable for around twenty Dukedom Level powers! First-rate forces might manage to buy one, but only at great personal cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rest of the equipment is much more affordable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren finished his explanation, leaving Osborne a bit taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought in disbelief, "An Ultimate Light Airship, complete with a divine power shield and capable weapons, is only 100 million Essence Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Wild Flame City, even a basic Ultimate Malevolence Airship without a shield or any weapons costs at least 500 million Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And only the top ten Upper Races are even eligible to purchase one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced over at Hannah, who also wore a look of astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's unbelievably cheap! An Ultimate Malevolence Airship outfitted with the same weaponry as the Supreme Malevolence Airship for just 100 million? That really is a steal!" Hannah gasped, her eyes wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a nod, Osborne felt an increasing admiration for the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought for a moment and then asked, "Where do all the major powers get their Essence Crystals? I know that in Wild Flame City, the larger factions have their own mines. Is it the same here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! In the West Zone, mines don't belong to any one faction. Any individual or group can freely mine for Essence Crystals! The Sanctum of Light takes a ten percent 'tax' from the haul and sends out the Lumina Guards to protect those mining, but it doesn't guarantee safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, larger forces often hire workers to help with harvesting or trade other goods for crystal access. Even places like Apocalypse Divine Peak are open to anyone! If you're lucky, you might snag some Ultimate Essence Crystals, maybe even Celestial Crystals or Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But everyone knows Apocalypse Divine Peak is incredibly dangerous, so generally, folks don't venture there lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, the God of Night and God of Light laid down rules forbidding any significant forces from claiming territory in the mines!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The mines are the property of every member of the Human Community! But some big powers still take risks and send people to steal from others. While the Lumina Guards maintain order in the mines, once you leave, you're fair game for ambushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A hard-earned Essence Crystal could easily be taken from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Darren finished speaking, Osborne nodded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his view, the situation here was far more reasonable than in Wild Flame City. There, the mines belonged solely to the superpowers, who exploited Human Community slaves to do the hard labor. Ordinary people or lesser factions had to serve these superpowers just to have a chance at getting their hands on Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here in Apocalypse City, as long as one was willing to put in the effort, there was no shortage of Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, every place has its dark side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some factions would resort to ruthless tactics for profit, and even the Sanctum of Light couldn't eliminate that completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see! No wonder Apocalypse City feels so much more vibrant than Wild Flame City! Ordinary folks here seem to live better lives than those in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It makes sense that there are so many different factions in Apocalypse City," Osborne mused, growing increasingly fond of this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Wild Flame City, Apocalypse City was much larger and seemed far more suitable for the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no surprise that most members of the Human Community were fighting tooth and nail against the Dark Deity Legion. They understood that if their city fell, what awaited them would be slaughter, enslavement, and a life of subjugation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lord, just ahead is the Pioneers of Starlight's base!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our base is an entire mountain that we pooled our resources to purchase! While we may barely qualify as a second-rate power, the size of our base rivals that of the top second-rate factions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it has been abandoned for a year now. Oh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Darren spoke, he suddenly furrowed his brow, staring intently at a beautiful estate perched on the mountaintop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate was brightly lit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hanging on its grand entrance was a sign that read: [Radiant Era Syndicate!]</span></p><div class="pagination">
