  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne resurrected right in front of the God of Light, there was no reason to keep secrets any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded firmly, his expression resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's true&mdash;it's all thanks to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! I've completely fused with it; I am the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and it is me! This power allows me to come back from the dead. Moreover, I can grant a select number of others the same ability to resurrect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze locked onto the God of Light, who stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only do you possess the ability to resurrect after death, but you can also grant that same power to others?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light turned to look at Osborne, her eyes gleaming with something akin to awe or perhaps calculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear she wanted to say something, but each time her lips parted, words failed to come out. The idea seemed too monumental, too overwhelming to articulate easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently, sensing her excitement, "I know what you're thinking, God of Light. But the resurrection ability is limited. I can only bestow it upon a certain number of individuals. Plus, each resurrection requires a significant amount of energy, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She urged, her breath quickening, "What? What else? Just tell me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever it takes, I'll make it happen! The ability to resurrect is crucial for the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded again, his tone serious. "You can gather the key figures from the Sanctum of Light, and I can grant them the power of resurrection. However, for every person I bring back, the Sanctum of Light will need to pay me one hundred Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five million at most!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light gasped, "Five million? That's more than enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Sanctum of Light has only three million members! And paying a hundred Celestial Crystals for each resurrection? That's a small price to pay for a life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her excitement was palpable as she envisioned the possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll start gathering everyone from the Sanctum of Light right away! I'll also bring in some key figures from the Human Community, especially the young talents. I hope you can grant them the same resurrection ability."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, but there was a caution in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They must be people you can absolutely trust. If word about the resurrection ability gets out, I fear Lord Malevolence might take action against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned grave as he continued, "The resurrection power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity has its limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone like Lord Malevolence, a super warrior, could genuinely have the strength to kill me. Even if he can't, he could capture me and seal me away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to find myself in that situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's expression shifted to one of seriousness as she nodded firmly. "Don't worry. I know exactly what to do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately set to work, delegating tasks to her trusted aides while keeping her eyes locked on Osborne. "So, Osborne, what's your plan now that you've 'died'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne replied, "I need to find a way to increase my power! I hope the upcoming tournament can last longer, giving me more time to cultivate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My cultivation level is still too low!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, I can't sway the outcome of this all-out war. I need to become stronger&mdash;much stronger&mdash;if I want to change the course of this conflict!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light couldn't help but stare at him in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne aimed to enhance his cultivation level to influence the war's direction?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such ambition!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she, in the grand scheme of things, felt like just a pawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne seemed intent on becoming the one pulling the strings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That thought sent a shiver down her spine. The stakes were higher than ever, and the road ahead was fraught with danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light shook her head, unable to shake off her doubts about Osborne's ambitions. Despite his remarkable talent&mdash;one that rivaled even the God of Night and Lord Malevolence&mdash;his current cultivation level was simply too low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grand chessboard of this all-out war had only two players&mdash;the God of Night and Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne to rise to their level, he had a long, arduous journey ahead of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his exceptional gifts, without a stroke of extraordinary luck, it would take him ages to reach such heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And time was not on their side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the God of Light held her tongue, wary of shattering Osborne's confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she nodded and said, "You're right! I'll do everything I can to extend the competition's duration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it won't be for long... I suspect the Icy One's patience will only last a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can't seize Peaks City by then, he'll likely launch an all-out war immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month was just around the corner, especially for someone like the Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard he tried, he wouldn't see significant improvement in that short span.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was another reason she doubted Osborne's chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only a month?" Osborne frowned slightly but nodded. "I'll put every ounce of effort into boosting my strength during that time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! But first, we need to ensure that the Paramount Supreme Clan doesn't manage to use the competition to force us out of Peaks City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they gain control, they won't hesitate to initiate a full-scale war against the Human Community," the God of Light warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly. "Don't worry, I've got a plan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan thinks they can just waltz in and take Peaks City through the tournament, but it won't be that easy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence radiated from him as he continued, "I'll leave some members of the Blood Demon behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'll ensure victory in the Deity King Level matches! As for the Hudson family warriors, with Draconic Formation, they can secure wins in the Deity Overlord Level matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then we have Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Hannah, and Kendra&mdash;those five can compete in the Ascension One and Ascension Two Supernal Deity King matches! With their strength, we're guaranteed to win those two contests!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This way, the Human Community should secure at least four victories in total. But how many we win each day is up to you. We can't win too few, or we'll lose Peaks City. But we also can't win too many, or the Paramount Supreme Clan might lose hope and decide to launch their war earlier than expected..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, the God of Light nodded, a smile breaking through her earlier tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hearing you lay it all out like that gives me hope! No matter what, I'll do my utmost to keep the tournament going for a full month!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, I hope you'll be much stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will be!" Osborne's eyes sparkled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the God of Light took swift action, calling together the members of the Sanctum of Light, along with key figures and promising young talents from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne worked from the shadows, replicating their life essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they fell in battle, he would have the means to bring them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once this crucial task was complete, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coming month would be his time to push himself to the limits and elevate his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His destination? The deep space!</span></p><div class="pagination">
