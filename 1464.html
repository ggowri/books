  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really true? Does he actually have four million Essence Crystals?" Zion's disbelief lingered in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana shot him a cold glare. "Are you questioning me? Do you think I'd lie for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not at all, not at all!" Zion stammered, suddenly taken aback by the fierce look on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly recoiled, his anger toward Osborne intensifying as he shot Osborne a venomous glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Zion who had insisted on checking Osborne's finances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the results showed that Osborne indeed had over four million Essence Crystals, a slap in the face that he couldn't ignore. How could he not be furious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic human! You will pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just got lucky! That Dimensional Bag of yours? You probably found it lying around, or maybe you stumbled upon some ancient relic, which is the only way you could have all those Essence Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I take you down, everything you got from that relic will belong to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinister smile crept across Zion's face as he plotted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many others shared his thoughts, though they kept their mouths shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana returned the Dimensional Bag to Osborne, leaning in to speak quietly, "Mr. Lachlan Swift, the saleswoman Lillian Fairfax who offended you, along with that security guard from the Margery family, will be fired immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you can overlook the unpleasantness they caused you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, thinking, "Turns out, money really does talk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tiana saw the million mid-grade Essence Crystals in his Dimensional Bag, she had no hesitation about firing Lillian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded in appreciation. "Thank you, Ms. Tiana Hart! But I want to make it clear that I'll keep my promise. I plan to spend at least ten million today and become a VIP customer here. I don't want to make things difficult for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana's eyes lit up at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, you need to be careful of these people! They're probably plotting against you. Your Dimensional Bag is incredibly valuable, not to mention the Essence Crystals inside it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While you're safe in the slave market, you need to watch your back once you leave. The Swift family has cut ties with you; they won't hesitate to take action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have a way to help you avoid their threats."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What's your plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana smiled, "Become a Super VIP at the slave market!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you spend over 100 million low-grade Essence Crystals, you'll earn the Super VIP status and the protection that comes with it. You'll receive a Super VIP badge, and with that, no one will dare to lay a finger on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attacking our Super VIPs means declaring war on the slave market! Plus, you can request our assistance for a fee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our reputation carries weight in Wild Flame City, especially since our backers come from the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are you interested in becoming a Super VIP?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, considering her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "So, becoming a Super VIP offers protection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That sounds useful; at least, it could save me a lot of trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But a hundred million is no small sum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied calmly, "Alright, I understand. But whether I become your Super VIP depends on the quality of your slaves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne returned to his seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can we get the auction back on track now?" he asked, looking around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana smiled and nodded, saying, "Of course! The auction will resume shortly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clapped her hands, and soon enough, servants appeared, bringing an array of fruits and delicacies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They carefully arranged the spread around Osborne, elevating his status even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other attendees couldn't help but feel a pang of envy at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the auction quickly picked up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, we have twenty exquisite female slaves from the Human Community. The current bid stands at four million! Four million, going once, going twice... any higher bids?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zion's expression turned sour. Four million was already beyond his expectation, and he had to grudgingly hold his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even if the Margery family was a second-tier power, four million Essence Crystals wasn't pocket change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Osborne successfully snagged the first batch of twenty superior female Human Community slaves for four million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's move on to the second batch of slaves!" the auctioneer announced enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the next group stepped onto the stage, it quickly became clear that they were all robust male slaves from the Human Community, radiating strength and exuding an aura of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had reached the level of Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The starting bid is one million! Please note that the minimum bid increment is 100 thousand! Let the auction begin!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
