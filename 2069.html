  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The handsome man grew frantic, his face etched with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Alfreda's older brother, Sherwood Rivera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood was the only prince in the Nature Elf Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nature Elves were rare, and the royal family had dwindled to only a few scattered members. Alfreda had only one brother and one sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sister, Yesenia Rivera, had left Elf City many years ago. Yesenia had said she was going out into the world, and she never returned. No one knew what had become of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, apart from their father and mother, the Nature Elf Royal Family consisted only of Sherwood and Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was Sherwood's only baby sister, and he had always cherished and spoiled her. When he heard that Alfreda had gotten into trouble again and was likely to be punished, he panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, oh Alfreda! How could you lose control again? You know full well that Princess Monica was deliberately trying to provoke you, using the might of the Fire Kingdom to coerce our father into punishing you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you not hold back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you've caused trouble. What will our father do? What about mother? What am I supposed to do? We cannot stand up against the Fire Elf Royal Family! You're bound to be punished! This time, you might even be expelled from Elf City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you must find a place to hide right away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But hide where? It seems there isn't any safe haven. What </span><span>should</span><span> we do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, what should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood was beside himself with worry, completely at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Sherwood, why are you so panicked? I'm not in any danger. Just quiet down. You're making my head spin!" she complained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew his frantic state came only from concern, and it warmed her heart even as she felt a pang of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the moment she recalled Monica's taunting, arrogant sneer, and how Monica intended to vent her rage on Osborne, she regretted nothing about her actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waving her hand dismissively, she declared, "What is there to fear? As long as I live, there will be a turning point! It's just punishment. I'm not afraid. I will face it head-on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda strode into the inner depths of the palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood continued to fidget and followed her closely, exclaiming quickly, "How can you be so foolish! If you get punished this time, you might be expelled from Elf City! Do you have any idea how dangerous the world beyond is? Ever since Yesenia left Elf City, she never came back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you end up like Yesenia, how could our parents ever accept it? Do you think I could ever come to terms with that? No. You must not leave Elf City. Only under the protection of the Elven Mother Tree can we truly survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and hide! Perhaps you can try to see if the Elven Mother Tree will shelter you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that doesn't work..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda halted once more and covered her ears forcefully, exasperated. "Sherwood, my dear brother, would you shut up already? You're so loquacious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you calm down a bit? I'm not afraid of the Fire Elf Royal Family. Being expelled from Elf City is hardly a challenge. Why are you so worked up? You are the sole prince of our Nature Elf Royal Family and the future King of Nature Elf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, pouting, she muttered, "When I marry, I swear I won't choose a nag like you. I want to marry the most imposing man, someone who will beat anyone who dares bully me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared fiercely at Sherwood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood managed a wry smile. "I worry about you, that's all! Besides, I don't really aspire to be King of Nature Elf. Alfreda, your talent far exceeds mine. You are a super genius with a Class SS overall score from the Astral Testing Arch. You are the best candidate for King of Nature Elf!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alfreda clamped her hand over Sherwood's mouth, scanning the surroundings intently to make sure no one else was within earshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sherwood, keep your voice down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said gravely, "Remember, you must not tell anyone about my Class SS overall score from the Astral Testing Arch. Otherwise, we'll be in even deeper trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, you must not tell a soul!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickening her pace, she added, "And stop nagging!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sherwood wanted to say more, but upon hearing her final words, he fell silent with a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he trailed behind her, his worry unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Alfreda reached the grandest hall deep within the Nature Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the palace, a middle-aged man and woman were present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man had an air of authority, but when he saw Alfreda and Sherwood, his face softened into a gentle, indulgent smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the King of Nature Elf and Alfreda's father, Uriah Rivera!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was one of the nine great Elf Kings of Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him stood a middle-aged woman. She was Alfreda's mother, Hilaria Rivera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sherwood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why have you come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah greeted his children with a warm, loving smile, but his expression soon darkened as he fixed his gaze on Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you gotten into trouble again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah knew his daughter's nature all too well. By now, Alfreda was supposed to be at the Emerald Forest Lodge. Unless she apologized to Monica, she was not permitted to return to the Nature Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he understood that Alfreda would never apologize to Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah realized that the only way Alfreda could have returned was because she had caused trouble again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his forehead in exasperation, feeling utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda stuck out her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, I'm here to confess! Monica provoked me again. I couldn't help myself. I gave her a good beating! She went too far, too arrogant, and infuriating. In a way, I helped maintain order!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, if you must punish me, then do so!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you disown me and expel me from Elf City, I will have no regrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a pained, tearful expression as if she were about to cry, though her furtive glances betrayed her true feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriah sighed helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are truly incorrigible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only shake his head and look up at the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"King Ainsworth, since you are here, please come forward and meet us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the faces of Alfreda and the others paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the very next moment, a tall Elf man engulfed in flames appeared in the grand hall. He cast a cold, sullen glance at Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was King of Fire Elf, Ainsworth Garza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriah, it seems you already know what happened! I won't mince words. Now tell me, what does your Nature Kingdom intend to do? Has Princess Alfreda beaten my daughter, Princess Monica, repeatedly in an act of provocation against the Fire Kingdom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you cannot offer me a satisfactory explanation, I will not let this go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If need be, let our two kingdoms go to war!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
