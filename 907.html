  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Jackie in disbelief. He thought, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a single word from Jackie could make Rumen slap himself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea about the private conversation between Isa and Rumen, nor did he realize that those two slaps were a price Rumen had to pay at Isa's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he knew was that Jackie had mentioned punishing Rumen, and the next thing he saw was Rumen delivering those self-inflicted blows. He gave all the credit to Jackie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, what kind of power does the Prophet Alliance wield? Just one word from Jackie, and Rumen slapped himself? Is the Prophet Alliance even stronger than the League of Divine Descent?" Osborne whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Isa couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She narrowed her eyes playfully and replied, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I know? I'm not exactly tight with them! But I've heard that the Prophet Alliance holds a pretty lofty status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who cares? At least you got your revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression remained serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Rumen slap himself felt satisfying, but Osborne knew that Rumen did that out of fear of the Prophet Alliance, not for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Rumen might well blame him for today's humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Honor Quest Ceremony wrapped up and Jackie left, would Rumen come after him and his family with a bigger vengeance? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That could happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worried, Osborne blamed himself for short of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were stronger, I could handle Rumen myself. No need for Jackie to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to level up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to break into Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced with a burning desire to grow stronger, but first, he had to face Isa in their long-anticipated battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's mind, the most formidable challenger in the Honor Quest Ceremony had never been Scarlett, Bradley, or Marlon; it had always been Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment she said she would be here and challenge Osborne, he had regarded her as his greatest test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to defeat Isa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to claim his position as the master of their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had said that as long as Osborne could best her, he could have his way with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed his gaze on Isa, determination burning in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, casting a glance at Jackie, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Flores, what are you still doing here? The Honor Quest Ceremony is still on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie jolted at her words, quickly retreating from the stage, his voice booming as he announced, "The Honor Quest Ceremony continues now! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final match: the number one contender in the Godson Rankings, 'Night,' challenges Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished, the crowd erupted into a chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He just beat Marlon and was ready to clear the Honor Quest Ceremony, and now here comes an even stronger challenger! This is the top-ranked prodigy in the Godson Rankings; there's no way Osborne can stand a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's as good as finished! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless 'Night' throws the match, he's got no hope! The top ranker is way beyond the average Class S Supreme Overlord. She's leagues ahead of Marlon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectators' comments left Osborne feeling a bit dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Isa wore a triumphant smile and talked with Osborne in a secret way that only two of them can hear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, looks like nobody believes in you. Why not just throw in the towel? It wouldn't be embarrassing to lose to me." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot her a glare, his resolve hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a chance! I've been gearing up to beat you for ages! Today, I'm taking you down and showing you who really runs this relationship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's the day I reclaim my power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa couldn't help but laugh, her eyes twinkling with mischief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that really what you want? To flip the script and be the master? I bet you can't wait to win and then have your way with me in bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cheeks flushed crimson, and he fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a teasing glint in her eye, Isa continued, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? You think it but can't say it? Don't worry; I keep my promises. I'll only use my ordinary Class AAA strength. If you can beat me, you can do whatever you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what are we waiting for? Let's get this show on the road; I'll definitely beat you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chuckled, shaking her head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that really how you want to play it? You're </span><span>gonna</span><span> wear yourself out. Why don't you take a moment to recover your strength first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for that! Let's start right now!" Osborne asserted, with unwavering determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled mischievously, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're sure about this? Don't come crying to me later if things get rough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Isa was right in front of Osborne, her long leg striking out toward his chest with startling force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had anticipated this move; after all, he'd been caught off guard by kicks like that countless times in the past. He was ready for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isa's foot flew toward him, he responded instinctively and launched a kick of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their movements mirrored each other almost perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne had learned from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then came the inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was sent flying backward, breathless and reeling from the impact.</span></p><div class="pagination">
