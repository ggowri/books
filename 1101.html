  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Start the countdown now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, you only have five minutes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's icy voice rang out. Everett's expression immediately changed, filled with anger, frustration, and urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Osborne, we've already lost more than thirty men to take down these damned clones. How could you think I'm stalling for time? We're all giving it everything we've got! How could we possibly kill them all in just five minutes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You promised not to attack us! You're not going to go back on your word, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered at his words, "Break my promise? Hah! You all are deliberately stalling, and you still expect me to keep my word? Ridiculous! If I'm not mistaken, you're waiting for reinforcements, aren't you? Planning to take us all out once your backup arrives?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was full of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's face instantly turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly said, "Osborne, I don't know what you're talking about. We're here in Rosmandi, thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of miles away from any League of Divine Descent forces. How could reinforcements possibly reach us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just want to survive! We don't want to fight to the death with the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "Let's assume you're telling the truth. Too bad your speed doesn't satisfy me. Since you can't guarantee you'll kill them off in five minutes, let me help you kill them off! And while I'll...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll finish you off as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly gave the command, his voice filled with cruelty. "Wipe them all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Blood Demon members moved into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the League of Divine Descent had about fifty Class S warriors left, and the Aberrants still had roughly a hundred Class S clones, totaling around one hundred and fifty Class S fighters, and it was still a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But compared to the over four hundred they had before, they were now just a shadow of their former strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the strength of the Blood Demon members, this situation was now well within their control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the Blood Demon members launched their attacks, unleashing a barrage of strikes that blanketed the battlefield in a deluge of firepower. Among them were attacks from Osborne, Wesson, Bryce, and Greyson, all Class S, creating a terrifying scene that blotted out the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, the League of Divine Descent members and the Aberrant clones at the center of this onslaught began to fall one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agonizing screams echoed through the dark forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett, desperately dodging and defending, wore a face of furious defiance. "Osborne, stop! You swore an oath to the gods that you wouldn't attack us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Everett watched his comrades from the League of Divine Descent were slaughtered one by one, his rage was uncontrollable, his eyes filled with unbridled fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded with a cold smile, "Yes, I did swear. But I said that as long as you took out all these Class S clones, I wouldn't attack you. Unfortunately, you still haven't managed to kill them all, so my action doesn't break the oath, does it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett's face flushed with rage, but he could do nothing against Osborne, continuing to dodge frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched it all unfold with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Murmuring to himself, he said, "Still trying to buy time? Do you really think I'm that foolish? I let you stall before because I also needed time to set things up, but now that everything's in place, there's no need to keep you around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I let you live, and your reinforcements arrive to join forces with you, you'd be much harder to deal with. Better to wipe you out now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne ordered his men to intensify their attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he activated his Satan's Eye, scanning the distant surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, Osborne had felt that his Satan's Eye was acting a bit strange. It had already reached the peak of level six, but now it seemed on the verge of breaking through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For centuries, no one in the Augustine family had ever managed to break through level six of the Satan's Eye. Osborne himself had never felt such a sensation before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, that feeling of a breakthrough was right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as though just a little more and his Satan's Eye would advance beyond level six to level seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was missing wasn't his own capability but the limitations of this time and space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a feeling that something big is about to happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, not giving it much thought as he continued to scan with Satan's Eye. According to his calculations, the reinforcements from the League of Divine Descent should be arriving soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, under the relentless assault from the Blood Demon members, Everett and his people were struggling to hold their ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every moment saw more lives lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just three minutes, the last hundred or so Class S clones were all slaughtered. The League of Divine Descent was down to a mere ten members, all of them in a miserable state, barely clinging to life under the relentless barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Everett himself was now severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were bloodshot as he shouted furiously, "Osborne, damn you! I won't let you get away with this, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was speaking, Everett's eyes suddenly lit up, and then he burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're finished! The reinforcements from the League of Divine Descent are here! You're doomed!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
