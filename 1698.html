  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, the weight of the future heavy on his shoulders, "Should the Human Community of Celestara ultimately fall to Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion, this place will become our last hope for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do everything I can to save as many members of the Human Community as </span><span>possible, bringing them to Hope Haven to live. From there, I'll take Hope Haven and leave Celestara</span><span>. WE will </span><span>search</span><span> </span><span>for a new place to thrive. Once we've grown strong enough, we can return to Celestara and drive Lord Malevolence away, reclaiming our home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These thoughts troubled Osborne, and he fervently hoped that such a day would never come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it did, it would mean near-total destruction for the Human Community of Celestara. Hope Haven covered only a radius of about six thousand mile</span><span>s. H</span><span>ow many could it truly accommodate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It would be best if we could defeat Lord Malevolence here and now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, glancing once more at the rejuvenated Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anastasia, Sebastian, and the others sensed a shift in energy and emerged from their meditative states. When they beheld the transformed Hope Haven, vibrant with renewed energy, astonishment lit up their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned their attention to Osborne, curiosity flickering in their eyes. Osborne flashed a reassuring smile and began to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian murmured thoughtfully, "Hope Haven? I really like that name!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow chimed in, her enthusiasm infectious, "Absolutely! It's perfect! This place is not just the last hope for the Human Community; it's also a cradle for our future... All of us here are part of the fight against Lord Malevolence! Especially you, Osborne. I increasingly believe you're the key to whether we can overcome him. You are our greatest hope!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm confident that one day, you'll lead us to defeat Lord Malevolence and cast his Dark Deity Legion from Celestara, restoring it as a sanctuary for the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star nodded vigorously in agreement, his expression resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila, now blossoming into a striking young woman, echoed their sentiments, her voice filled with conviction. "Osborne, you can do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce beamed and added, "You've got this, Osborne! Rather than just calling this place Hope Haven, you are the very embodiment of hope for the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!" the others agreed, their voices a chorus of support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked around, touched by their unwavering faith in him. He hadn't expected such belief from them, especially since he himself felt far from confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Lord Malevolence was incredibly formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne had gained enough strength to contend with Deity King warriors, he was merely at the initial stage. The power disparity between him and Lord Malevolence was like that between a man and an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Lord could crush him without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, Lord Malevolence commanded countless forces from various races alongside the vast Dark Deity Legion numbering in the hundreds of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, Osborne was plagued by despair. Did he possess the power to change the tide of the war between Lord Malevolence and the Human Community? He feared he might not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he looked into the hopeful faces of his comrades, Osborne felt a surge of </span><span>strength within him, a rush of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'll do my best!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may have a huge gap to close with Lord Malevolence right now, and the Human Community's strength pales compared to the combined forces of his various races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm committed! I will drive Lord Malevolence out of Celestara!" Osborne declared, his voice steady with newfound resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden thought struck him. "Grandpa, Anastasia, you should keep training. I need to head out and handle some trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded, their expressions serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful, Osborne! If you need help, don't hesitate to call us. We may not be as strong as you, but we're no pushovers either! We don't want to just be under your protection all the time." Sebastian cautioned, concern evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, appreciation warming his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, when I need your help, I won't hesitate to ask! Make sure to break through as quickly as you can. If you run low on resources, feel free to grab what you need from the central treasury!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's figure vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, Angelo had sent word that he had arranged a meeting with three Deity King warriors</span><span>, </span><span>Chandler, Arnold, and Mariah. They would be arriving shortly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne dismissed his Spatial Clone and waited patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, the Human Community doesn't have the strength to stand against Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion. Even if I were to head to the West Zone, it wouldn't significantly change our situation. I need to find a way to secretly control Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by weakening them while strengthening the Human Community do we stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ninth Dark Deity Legion will be my first target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, his resolve hardening as he spotted four figures approaching rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three warriors trailing behind him exuded a powerful aura, rivaling Angelo's and even surpassing it in strength. They were two men and one woman, all Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men, with a piercing gaze, radiated an energy that was clearly a level above the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That must be Chandler, close to the mid-stage of Deity King!" Osborne thought, a fierce glint flashing in his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
