  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a </span><span>deep</span><span> </span><span>breath. Staring at the translucent war drum before him, he was somewhat stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is the origin of this drum really that incredible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This </span><span>war drum was</span><span> crafted tens of thousands of years ago by the strongest ruler of this part of the cosmos, Queen Bug, also known as Empress Kira, who personally skinned herself and dismantled her bones to create it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't fathom how powerful Empress Kira must have been to rule such a vast cosmos, nor could he imagine her skinning herself and dismantling her bones to craft a war drum!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt she was truly admirable!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but ask, "What does the Drum of Empress Kira do? Would I shatter a planet or destroy a galaxy just by lightly beating it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought it was a bit absurd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Primordial shook his head. "Shatter a planet or destroy a galaxy? Osborne, you're underestimating the Drum of Empress Kira! Even now, Empress Kira is still hailed as the strongest Master!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her strength is beyond even my imagination! Even if I fused the other eight offshoots of the World Tree and reverted to being the original World Tree, I wouldn't dare claim I could defeat Empress Kira one-on-one!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the Drum of Empress Kira was personally crafted by her, stripping her own skin, breaking her own bones, and burning her final life force. No one could possibly imagine the power of this war drum!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If its power were to erupt..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget a single galaxy, even a hundred galaxies, ten thousand galaxies would instantly vanish, collapsing into the universe's most basic particles! Perhaps half the universe would face catastrophic upheaval."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Primordial finished speaking, Osborne's eyes widened in shock once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Primordial ignored him and continued, "However, this is just my speculation! After the Drum of Empress Kira was successfully created, she immediately broke free and disappeared. No one has ever witnessed its power firsthand!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I don't know what </span><span>powers</span><span> the Drum of Empress Kira possesses either! Perhaps, it might do nothing at all! Everything is just a legend."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even the people who know about the Drum of Empress Kira are extremely few! I only learned about it by stealing part of the No. 1 World Tree offshoot's memory."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Primordial shrugged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, it's definitely a treasure! But with your current strength, you simply can't use it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How do you know I can't use it? Since it resonated with me and drew me here, maybe it wants to recognize me as its master?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and approached the Drum of Empress Kira.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled faintly and didn&rsquo;t stop him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With your current strength, even if you obtain an Ultimate Sacred Artifact, you can't use your Sacred Power to drive it! And you still want to use the Drum of Empress Kira? Are you kidding me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even those Sovereign Masters at the center of the universe probably can't move it an inch! As for why it resonated with you, I have no idea. Maybe it has taken a liking to something on you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Primordial was speaking, Osborne raised his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hand seemed to be gently stroking something, but Primordial couldn&rsquo;t see it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was also looking forward to what would happen between Osborne and the Drum of Empress Kira.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was stroking the body of the Drum of Empress Kira. If Primordial hadn&rsquo;t told him, he could never have imagined that the drum body was forged from Empress Kira&rsquo;s bones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It looks very ordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's hand rested on it, but he didn&rsquo;t sense any energy fluctuations, as if it were just an ordinary war drum, not even a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "Could it be that I really can't use the Drum of Empress Kira?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's fingers traced the patterns on the drum body. They appeared to be various Bug Clan creatures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw Ice Beetles on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The difference was that these Ice Beetles were not transparent but pure gold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pure gold Ice Beetles?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head, ignored them, and reached out to touch the drumhead of the Drum of Empress Kira.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This drumhead was made from the skin of Sovereign Master, Empress Kira!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but shake his head. He still didn't feel any energy fluctuations, as if it were just an ordinary layer of cowhide...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But its texture just looks a bit nicer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's palm brushed over the patterns on the drumhead. The drum still showed no reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like the Drum of Empress Kira really isn't something I can use!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne gently tapped the drumhead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to hear if the sound of the Drum of Empress Kira would be any different from that of an ordinary drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His palm landed on the drumhead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a dull drum sound echoed, similar to that of an ordinary drum. Nothing unusual happened, nor was there any energy fluctuation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The drum sound attack Osborne anticipated didn&rsquo;t happen either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was very disappointed. Just as he was about to lift his hand, he was shocked to find his palm stuck!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a terrifying suction force emanated from the drumhead of the Drum of Empress Kira, firmly attaching his palm to it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how hard Osborne tried, he couldn&rsquo;t lift his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He panicked instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could this happen?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Primordial. Primordial also noticed Osborne's abnormality at this moment. Although he couldn't see the Drum of Empress Kira, he knew Osborne's palm was stuck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly said, "Osborne, don't panic! The Drum of Empress Kira is responding, this is a good thing! Don't resist!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't resist? It's not your palm that's stuck, so you're acting so relaxed?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Osborne stopped resisting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, resisting was useless. The pulling force from the drum surface was truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was surprised to find that the patterns on the drum surface suddenly lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Complex patterns were lighting up rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, they all spread toward the shadow at the center of the drum surface, that strange bug with eight legs, six eyes, and dozens of wings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne guessed that the shadow of this bug was the true form of Empress Kira.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a bit strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the complex patterns on the drum surface grew brighter, even spreading onto the drum body. The countless Bug Clan on the drum body were glowing, as if they had come to life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, all the light converged at the center of the drum surface. The shadow of the bug also began to glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its eight legs, dozens of wings, sharp horn on its head, razor-like mouthparts, and six eyes all began to light up one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, the entire shadow of the bug emitted a radiant, multicolored glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt as if it had come to life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its six eyes were staring at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a pleasant voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><div class="pagination">
