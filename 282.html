  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, hesitating whether he should open it and see what Evelyn had sent him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt both hatred and guilt towards Evelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hated Evelyn because, during the three years of his marriage with Ophelia, Evelyn was the </span><span>most mean</span><span> person to him. If it hadn't been for Evelyn, his life in the Caldwell family wouldn't have been so miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many Caldwells dared to be so vicious to him because of Evelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Evelyn was the root cause of his three years of humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, she was the fundamental reason why Ophelia divorced Osborne and why he was kicked out of the Caldwell family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he felt guilty towards Evelyn because he had pushed Evelyn down on the sofa that day and retaliated against her, which was outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne almost lost his mind at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could have killed Evelyn instead of treating her like that. That was not what a man should do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he thought about it, Osborne felt regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since he had done it, there was no point in him regretting it. He could only try not to think about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Evelyn did not tell anyone about what happened that day, perhaps because she was too embarrassed to expose it or perhaps for some other reason. In any case, it became a secret between him and Evelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had thought that he and Evelyn would have nothing to do with each other from then on, but he didn't expect that Evelyn would send him a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated, wondering whether to take a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's wrong? Who sent you the message? Why didn't you read it?" Clarissa sensed something was wrong with Osborne and asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a look. What if it's urgent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip and finally nodded. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he checked the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a strange look appeared on his face, and he frowned again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa didn't peek at the message, but seeing Osborne frowning, she became worried. "Osborne, what happened? You seem worried. Is there any trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though hesitant, Osborne finally showed Clarissa the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading it, Clarissa was also surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Wesley crazy? Ophelia doesn't want to marry him and refuses to be his secret lover, so he wants to rape her?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa felt astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her simple world, such crazy things were incomprehensible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can there be such a hateful man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's pretty face was filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, go save her! I know she is your ex-wife, and you don't want to have anything to do with her anymore, and you're afraid that I'll overthink. But she is a woman, after all, a life. Since they turn to you, you have to help!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't treat her as your ex-wife. Just take her as an ordinary woman who is being hurt. You must save her and never let that hateful man succeed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Clarissa's words, Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he was indeed struggling over whether or not to save Ophelia. Now, he had decided to let it go and not have anything to do with Ophelia in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's life was none of his business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clarissa's words shifted his view. Ophelia's actions were appalling. Driven by greed and wealth, she ended their marriage, forcing him to leave with nothing and suffering abuse from security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deserved the consequences she had today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had become aware of this event after it occurred, he would have likely dismissed it with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he could save Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn had sent him a message for help. If he ignored it, refused to save Ophelia, and allowed her to be raped by Wesley, then what was the difference between him and a bastard like Wesley?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Clarissa said, he didn't have to treat Ophelia as his ex-wife but just as an ordinary woman who was being assaulted by a bad guy. Now that he had bumped into that, how could he turn a deaf ear?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made a decision. "Clarissa, I can't walk with you anymore. Wait for me. I'll be back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded. "Osborne, just be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. The Ashford family and Wesley were no big deal. They could no longer pose a threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne rushed out quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He first made a phone call and then drove quickly to Rose Castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, in the messy wedding hall of Rose Castle, a group of bodyguards from the Ashford family surrounded Wesley to prevent the Caldwells from rescuing Ophelia and Evelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley, with a fierce expression, grasped Evelyn's hair with one hand and lifted her while holding a pistol in the other, aiming it at her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was despair in Evelyn's eyes at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized no one could rescue her. Even if she appealed for help to Osborne, it would take at least ten minutes for him to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley had been insane, and he wouldn't be patiently torturing her before killing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps in the next second, Wesley would pull the trigger and blow her head off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, many images emerged in Evelyn's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was once young and beautiful, yet vain and greedy. Thus, she married Ophelia's father and became her stepmother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Evelyn discovered after her marriage that Ophelia's father was infertile due to illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He married Evelyn just to cover up this scandal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's father asked her to make shameful noises every night so that everyone would think that he was still a man.</span></p><div class="pagination">
