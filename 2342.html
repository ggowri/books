  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne and the others returned to Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could clearly feel that Angela let out a sigh of relief. Her expression also became much more relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne became even more puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't ask any questions; instead, he glanced at Clara and Leroy and waved at them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You should go back and train hard to improve your strength. Three months later, we'll meet at the zone duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Clara and Leroy nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, thank you. If it weren't for you, we couldn't have made it to the top ten in the state duel. During these three months, we will definitely train hard and improve our strength. We won't embarrass you at the zone duel," Clara said earnestly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "That's right. You should train hard too. We believe that even at the zone duel, you will surely achieve a great result."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Let's work hard together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the vice dean of Azure Haven Academy and the deputy master of Fantasia Isle came over to sincerely thank Osborne for helping Leroy and Clara. They promised some benefits and said that whenever he had time to visit Azure Haven Academy or Fantasia Isle, they would warmly welcome him. However, to Osborne, none of this mattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't care. After saying goodbye, he followed Angela onto the Mystic Sirius Sect's battleship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Danilo, Bethan, and Jamar were already waiting for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bethan and Jamar accepted invitations from other warriors in this state duel, performed decently, and even earned a lot of Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew their strength was too average, even poor, in the state duel. So, they were already very satisfied with such gains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn't even feel envious of Osborne winning the state </span><span>duel</span><span> championship because he was simply too strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Bethan and Jamar's view, every one of the thousand participants in the state duel was stronger than them, and Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson were especially powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne managed to defeat all four of them and become the champion. That level of strength was beyond their comprehension.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bethan and Jamar only felt admiration for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They quickly returned to Mystic Sirius Sect aboard the Mystic Sirius Sect's warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing they were about to arrive at Mystic Sirius Sect, Angela completely calmed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, the warship suddenly began to shake violently, as if struck by a terrifying energy, almost falling from the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warship's protective shield was also shaking violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and the others on the warship simultaneously turned pale at this moment, quickly turning to look into the distance. But they saw nothing, only feeling a terrifying force sweeping over like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What&rsquo;s going on?" Osborne frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already activated Satan's Eye, trying to see where this terrifying force was coming from. But he saw nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within his field of vision, there were vast fluctuations of power everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They must have started fighting," Angela said seriously again. "We need to hurry back to Mystic Sirius Sect. Staying within the Clan Protective Formation of Mystic Sirius Sect will be safer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Angela in surprise. "A fight? Between who?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was very curious. "Ms. Olsen, what exactly are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela thought for a moment and said, "We are already back in Tempest Fortress City. It should be relatively safe here. If you want to know, I can tell you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Someone must have attacked Agatha. When Agatha unleashed the power of the Dark Phoenix, all the top warriors on Racial Convergence Planet sensed it. Ms. Alba briefly appeared and told me some details."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba said many warriors don't want the Dark Phoenix to reappear, don't want the Dark Phoenix to survive, and want to completely eliminate it before it grows."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The strength of those people is terrifying. Ms. Alba even admitted that she couldn't protect the Dark Phoenix. It was also Ms. Alba who told me to take you away from Frost Peak City immediately after the state duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These energy fluctuations now indicate that the warriors of Frost Peak City are engaged in battle. After all, the Dark Phoenix is too important to the Ember Phoenix Clan. The Ember Phoenix Clan on Racial Convergence Planet will undoubtedly do whatever it takes to protect the Dark Phoenix."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I really hope the Ember Phoenix Clan can protect the Dark Phoenix. Otherwise..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Angela didn't continue speaking, but Osborne was already stunned."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He thought, 'Someone wants to kill Agatha? They don't want Agatha to grow as the Dark Phoenix?'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Such terrifying energy waves are actually caused by the warriors of Frost Peak City trying to kill Agatha, while the warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan desperately resist?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Frost Peak City is very far from here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What kind of warriors can cause such terrifying energy fluctuations? What kind of battle can affect the distant Tempest Fortress City? Even Ms. Alba admits she can't protect Agatha?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne's face was extremely grim."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He thought, 'I can feel such terrifying energy fluctuations even in Tempest Fortress City. How horrifying must Frost Peak City, the main battlefield, be right now? Even a trace of energy ripple there could probably kill me. Can Agatha survive?'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No wonder Agatha told me she couldn't fight me in a zone duel again. Turns out, she already knew she would face danger." Osborne frowned deeply, looking in the direction of Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela said, "Let's go. We've already arrived at Mystic Sirius Sect. This is beyond us, even Ms. Alba can't handle it. But Ms. Alba said someone will take care of it. The Ember Phoenix Clan on Racial Convergence Planet isn't weak; those people won't easily kill the Dark Phoenix."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the warship landed within Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mystic Sirius Sect had originally prepared a grand welcoming ceremony for Osborne. After all, Osborne had won the state </span><span>duel</span><span> championship. This was a great honor for Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the sudden incident caused all nine peaks of Mystic Sirius Sect to tremble, including the Clan Protective Formation. This made everyone extremely anxious, so the welcoming ceremony was canceled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt happy about this. He quickly returned to Peak Seven of Mystic Sirius Sect, back to his own residence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought for a moment and decided to try contacting Agatha via the terminal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the battle, Agatha had exchanged terminal contact information with him. At this moment, Osborne tried to contact Agatha, but there was no response for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Agatha really is in trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't overthink it. This is something you can't handle." At this moment, Primordial transformed into a small treant and appeared in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued, "We are so far from Frost Peak City, yet we can feel such powerful energy fluctuations. At this moment, there are at least several top-tier warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness battling in Frost Peak City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In such a situation, even ordinary warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness would be easily killed. You haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness yet. If you go, you're courting death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't risk going to save Dark Phoenix just because she's beautiful. You and I are one now. If you die, I die too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne glanced at Primordial speechlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Don't worry. I'm not stupid, and I know my own strength very well. I won't throw my life away. This level of battle is not something I can take part in."</span></p><div class="pagination">
