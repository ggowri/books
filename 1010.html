  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Makenzie, the head of the Draco Group's medical research facility, who called Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity in her voice froze him in place, panic flashing in his eyes as his body began to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something was wrong with Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just over a month ago, Osborne had finally brought Anastasia to the research lab, where Makenzie personally assured him that although her condition was tricky, it was treatable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had promised that within four weeks, Anastasia would wake up and recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, Osborne visited her when he&rsquo;s free, waiting silently for the day she would finally wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, receiving Makenzie's call, he had hoped it was good news&mdash;maybe even an announcement that Anastasia was awake. Instead, he was hit with a wave of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a whirlwind of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a world where his heart truly belonged to anyone, it was not to his grandfather, Sebastian, nor to the parents he had never met. It wasn't even to Isa, Clarissa, Emma, or Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No! It was to Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had picked up her when he was ten, and now nearly sixteen years had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had faced the toughest 15 years together, and though she wasn't his biological sister, she meant more to him than any blood relative ever could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't let anything happen to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Makenzie called him, a cold, raw panic seized Osborne, drowning out everything she said after that. Without a thought, he tore open a dimensional rift and dashed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he materialized at the Draco Group headquarters in Newport City. He raced down to the underground eighth floor, where the medical research facility was located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lab looked as if it had been hit by an explosion; equipment lay strewn across the floor, and several doors had been blown off their hinges. Fear was etched on every researcher's face, their eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the apparent epicenter of the blast was Anastasia's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fresh wave of fear washed over Osborne as he felt his legs were hard to move. He froze and stared in the direction of her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terror gripped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't bear to see what he dreaded most: the sight of his sister, broken and lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, you are here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Makenzie appeared, her expression frantic. She seized his hand and pulled him toward the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt like a zombie, going along with her without resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they neared the door, reality hit him like a freight train, and he suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't go inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fixing a wild gaze on Makenzie, he asked, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Harvey, what's going on with my sister? Is she... is she still alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, he felt as if the very strength had been drained from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Makenzie was momentarily taken aback, then she rushed to reassure him, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, don't panic! Anastasia is still alive! You hung up too quickly for me to explain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you're here, you can see for yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart soared at the glimmer of hope&mdash;Anastasia was alive! Without wasting a second, he dashed toward the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, he stopped, frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside her large room, it looked like a bomb had gone off. Everything was in disarray, debris scattered like confetti.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Energy explosion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes landed on Anastasia's frail body levitating in the center of the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still unconscious, her eyes tightly shut. But a powerful energy surrounded her, swirling and intensifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's astonishment was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was absolutely sure that Anastasia was just an ordinary girl, someone who had never dabbled in training. So how could there be such a powerful surge of energy radiating from her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This energy wave surpassed even Class A!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion that had rocked the place was clearly a result of the instability of the energy within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, trying to make sense of the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he caught sight of Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was barely ten feet away from Anastasia, worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, what's wrong? Please don't scare me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, are you okay?" Zoe called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's voice was shaky as she took tentative steps forward to check on Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, surprisingly, a fierce burst of energy erupted from Anastasia, crashing into Zoe before she could react. Despite having just broken through to Class A, Zoe was </span><span>powerless against the assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, she was sent flying backward, blood spilling from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Acting on instinct, Osborne lunged forward, catching Zoe mid-flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" Zoe exclaimed in relief as she realized who had saved her, though the worry quickly returned to her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening? Is Anastasia going to be alright? There must be something seriously wrong with her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent. His gaze locked on Anastasia with a grave look.</span></p><div class="pagination">
