  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had said, "The God of Night from the Court of the Sun was furious. In an instant, she plunged the entire world into darkness, wiping out nearly all the gods and living beings in existence. The few who survived were incredibly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the God of Time was one of them. She was dead, but just before her demise, she used her powers to turn back time to just before her death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, when she looked at the destroyed world, she realized she couldn't restore everything to how it was before. So, she chose another path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She expended all her power and consumed her own life force to accelerate the time of the entire solar system by hundreds of millions of times! With that accelerated time, she aimed to erase the scars of the War of the Gods and allow the world to give birth to intelligent life once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this acceleration is still happening. We're still in that time warp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time will only return to normal once the God of Time awakens to a certain extent. And when that happens, the gods will reappear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inhaled sharply, skepticism etched on his face. "Isa, why are you telling me this? Is this just some myth you've made up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, "How do you know I made it up? What if it's true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked, momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I won't keep you in suspense. The 'story' I told you isn't entirely true," Isa said, her tone lightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over Osborne. "So, it's not all a lie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's next words left Osborne momentarily speechless. He watched as her expression shifted to one of profound seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not quite. At that time, your strength was still weak, so I couldn't reveal all the truths. I had to weave some lies to avoid scaring you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious. "So, which parts are true? Which are false?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa wasted no time, answering swiftly, "The Court of the Sun is real, as is the Age of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gods and countless beings were indeed wiped out in an instant. But it wasn't the God of Night who did it; it was a powerful and terrifying Dark Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His name is Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He hails from the far reaches of the cosmos and is incredibly powerful. He enslaved many strong gods, granting them dark powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He roamed the universe, leaving a trail of carnage in his wake. He could drain the blood of millions in the blink of an eye! He could turn a thriving planet into a lifeless rock in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, he is extremely terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of her words weighed heavily on Osborne. He could see a flicker of genuine fear in Isa's eyes, a stark contrast to her usual confident demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shocked him to realize that she was truly scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For reasons he couldn't quite grasp, Osborne felt that this time, Isa's words were no longer just fantastical tales but echoes of real events that had actually transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa..." Osborne began, but she raised a hand to silence him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't interrupt me," she said, taking a deep breath before continuing, "Many years ago, Lord Malevolence's endless Dark Deities unexpectedly arrived in our solar system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most powerful organization in the solar system, the Court of the Sun, clashed with these Dark Deities in a terrifying war of the gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Countless gods perished, fell into a deep slumber, or were utterly annihilated in that conflict. They united all their strength to fend off the invasion of the Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They almost succeeded. Through immense sacrifice, they severely injured and suppressed the Dark Deities, forcing them into a state of eternal slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then, Lord Malevolence appeared!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In an instant, he cast the world into darkness! In that moment, even the God of Darkness lost all his power. When the shadows finally receded, the gods were nearly wiped out, billions of lives snuffed out, leaving the world a terrifying wasteland thick with death's chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only seven Deity Kings survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were the God of Death, the God of Life, the God of Night, the God of Light, the God of Time, the God of Space, and the God of Destiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Together, these seven mighty beings fought valiantly, paying a heavy price to unleash a secret spell that ultimately vanquished the already weakened Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In a final act of sacrifice, the God of Space ignited his own essence, sealing Lord Malevolence and the vast stretches of desolation in a pocket dimension, leaving behind just a small land of hope for renewal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Death, seeking to cleanse this new land of lingering death, burned away his own being, obliterating the remnants of the war and meeting his end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Life then sacrificed himself, pouring life back into the soil of this rebirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Destiny followed suit, reshaping the very fate of this fledgling realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, the God of Time consumed herself, hastening the flow of time to restore balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All that remained were the God of Night and the God of Light, their battered forms resolutely standing guard over this fragile sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this land of rebirth? It became known as&mdash;Blue Planet!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
