  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's expression changed, and she quickly turned around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person in a black cloak had appeared behind her without her noticing. He stood there, blending into the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?" said Ophelia coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she activated her powers. Time around, the man instantly warped, accelerating wildly. The exposed skin on his arm aged rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's eyes showed surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energy flickered around him. Time returned to normal. His aged skin became normal again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stared at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man smiled and said, "I didn't expect time powers to be so strange. You've just awakened your power, yet you can already harm me. Let me introduce myself. I'm George </span><span>Curme</span><span>, the first disciple of the great Aberrant King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am here under the orders of the Aberrant King. Your time power is rare and strong. The Aberrant King is very interested in you. He wishes to take you as his final disciple," said George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's expression remained cold upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know who George was and had no idea what the Aberrant King represented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply asked coldly, "How do you know that I awakened time powers? Only the Caldwell family knows this! Did you plant a spy in the Caldwell family? Who is the spy? How dare they betray me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled slightly and said, "A spy? The Caldwell family isn't worth planting a spy in because you're not worthy. As for how we know? You need to understand that there is nothing in this world that the Aberrant King doesn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Aberrant King is an omnipotent god!" said George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia sneered at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled and said, "It seems you don't believe me, but that's okay. You need power now, don't you? The Aberrant King can give you power! He can make you strong quickly if you're willing to become his disciple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll be stronger than anyone," he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's expression shifted slightly. She frowned and said, "Why should I believe you? Can the Aberrant King really make me strong quickly? How strong? Stronger than... Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George couldn't help but laugh when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is nothing! You have time powers. Under the Aberrant King's guidance, you'll soon surpass him and even crush him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even I could kill Osborne easily," he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. I have no reason to lie to you. Only the Aberrant King can give you power in this world. If you miss this chance, there won't be another," said George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn looked at Ophelia with concern but didn't dare to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Ophelia gritted her teeth and said, "If you want me to go with you, you have to prove your strength. If you're strong enough, I'll go with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," said George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled faintly and waved his hand, enveloping Ophelia and Evelyn in a surge of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go somewhere else, so we don't cause a panic," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Ophelia felt her vision blur. She was no longer at the Caldwell Manor but over the vast ocean. Looking around, she couldn't see the shoreline. She was clearly in the deep sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, there was a small island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia and Evelyn were both shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had they gotten to the deep sea?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a small trick. Don't be so surprised. Otherwise, what you see next might scare you to death," said George casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia took a deep breath. She calmed herself down and looked at George coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead with your demonstration," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem," said George.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled slightly and slowly raised his hand. A pair of gloves appeared on his hands, made from an unknown material that wasn't leather or metal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch closely!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, George suddenly punched towards the distant island. A fist made of what seemed like a storm appeared in front of him and instantly hit the island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, something terrifying happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire island shattered in an instant. The rocks, trees, and everything else on it turned to fine powder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few seconds, the entire island vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive crater appeared on the ocean's surface. The water poured into it, creating huge waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia watched all this and was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this something human strength can achieve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's body began to tremble violently. Her eyes were filled with a crazed light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smiled faintly and said, "This is nothing. Your power and talent are far stronger than mine. With the Aberrant King teaching you, you'll soon surpass me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's breathing quickened when she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's handsome face appeared in her mind. The coldness on his face deeply hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of hatred erupted in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! I'll go with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you can make me stronger than Osborne, I'm willing to become the Aberrant King's disciple!" she said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
