  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, more and more blood flowed from Medusa's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to be unable to withstand the effect of the petrification power. And the stone skin on Osborne's body was being shattered by the martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa had a gloomy expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Damn it, a Class AA like you can not only resist my petrification power, but you can even gain the upper hand in a consumption battle! If you don't die, it will be a huge disaster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, you have a weakness! Your girlfriend, Clarissa, must be hiding under that villa, right? I'm going to catch her right now!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Medusa put away her petrification power and rushed towards the place where Clarissa was in seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura vibrated wildly, and instantly completely solved the effect of petrification power. He flashed, stood in front of Medusa, and punched out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Medusa was alert and neutralized most of Osborne's power, but she was still blasted back a long distance and felt pain in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa suddenly realized that she didn't have much way to deal with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she could only say, "Why don't you come out? Do you still want to watch the show?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face suddenly changed when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discovered that the space around him had become somewhat different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had experienced this feeling once when he participated in the Augustine family Branch Bloodline Competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That time, Rodney used a strange ancient magic weapon to freeze the space within a radius of 30 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this time, the space was also frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the freeze was more thorough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was serious. He opened Satan's Eye and looked into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he saw a Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A super Titan who was at least 33 feet tall came quickly from the left. And the aura around him was extremely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class </span><span>AAA!Titan</span><span> Duke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was solemn. Suddenly, he felt the same powerful aura behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around and saw a giant wolf approaching quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a monster with horns on its head. And its aura was also terrifying. It was Tauren Duke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed. He looked to the right and saw another figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very familiar with this figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because his appearance was similar to Osborne's after he transformed into a vampire, except that he didn't have long blood-red hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Duke of the Blood Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's whole body tensed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including Duke Medusa, there were five Class AAA warriors at this time. They surrounded Osborne from all sides, even freezing the space, leaving Osborne no way to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were filled with mockery and coldness. And their murderous intent was extremely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Five Class AAA warriors came to surround and kill me? You, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, think highly of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan in front of him heard this and said disdainfully, "Do you think you are worthy of us surrounding and killing you? We are just worried that you will run away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan's voice was like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he ignored Osborne and stared at Medusa jokingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa Duke No. 6, you are such a loser! You can't even deal with a Class AA bug, and you still want us to help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa Duke No. 6 looked unhappy. "Titan Duke No. 7, shut up! Do you think he is an ordinary Class AA? He is a freak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want, you can try it yourself! If you can defeat him alone, I will avoid you next time I see you. How about that?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan laughed loudly. "Freak? </span><span>So</span><span> what if he's a freak? I've seen a lot of freaks. No matter how freak he is, he's just a Class AA! Compared to us, he's nothing! Now, I will kill him myself! I'll let you know that you can't deal with him, not because he's a freak, but because you're too weak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Titan twisted his neck, making crackling sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Osborne and said disdainfully, "I'm going to blow your body apart with one punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he punched out directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan's fist was like a vast stone, extremely rough. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he punched out, a whistling sound was heard, and the terrifying force seemed to </span><span>be able to shatter everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body was not even as big as the Titan's fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after feeling the power of the Titan's punch, Osborne was not afraid. Instead, he was filled with fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "You want to punch me? You don't get to do so!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Osborne added the martial art aura around his body to his fist and punched out as well.</span></p><div class="pagination">
