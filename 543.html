  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An old figure appeared among the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne knew this person. He was Caleb Augustine, the third elder of the Augustine family's main bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elder Caleb!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Elder Caleb!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the contestants from the nine branch bloodlines saw Caleb, they all bowed and saluted him. Even the proud people from Yalynch, Marcelin, and Ransford looked respectful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb smiled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are all the elites of the Augustine family's branch bloodlines and the future of the family. The Branch Bloodline Competition will be a grand event. I am very pleased to see that your strength is getting stronger and stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This time, you will not only strive for a higher ranking for your branch bloodline to obtain more resources but also strive for a place as the future heir of the family for the heir of your branch bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are two future heir spots in total. I am looking forward to which one of you will get them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Caleb began to scan the crowd, as if he was looking for someone he thought had hope to become the future heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He first looked at Lance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance immediately straightened his chest with confidence on his face, looking proud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb looked at Lance for more than ten seconds before he turned to look at Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam also straightened his body, with a fierce look and confidence in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's gaze stayed on him for five seconds, then he nodded and looked at David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's gaze only stayed on David for three seconds, which made David feel unhappy, but he didn't dare to say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When everyone thought that Caleb would then look at Rodney, the heir of the branch bloodline in Norlend, Caleb's eyes swept over him and didn't look at him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney's face suddenly turned gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This meant that Caleb didn't think highly of him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hum!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney snorted coldly, "Do you not think highly of me? I'll prove it to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb continued to scan the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He swept past Tony of the branch bloodline in Stayton, then Kent of the branch bloodline in Donovan, and then Henry and John.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's gaze never lingered on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Caleb's eyes stayed on Osborne for five or six seconds. He smiled and nodded at Osborne and then looked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, everyone looked at Osborne in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their faces were filled with disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did Caleb think highly of Osborne? His eyes stayed on Osborne for several seconds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The one Caleb thinks highly most is Lance. His eyes stayed on Lance for ten seconds. He must think that Lance will get a spot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But the person he thinks highly second is not Sam, but Osborne? His eyes stayed on Osborne for longer than Sam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was very surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They looked at Osborne and frowned tightly, not thinking Osborne looked hopeful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Other branch bloodlines sent many people to participate in the competition, but Osborne was alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did Caleb make a mistake?" Someone whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's face looked gloomy and terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at Osborne closely, thinking, "Humph! Does Caleb think Osborne has a better chance than me? That's ridiculous. When the competition begins, I will let everyone know that the second spot will be mine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, now that everyone is here, let's go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You nine branch bloodline heirs will take the same helicopter. I will tell you some rules about the competition on the plane."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb boarded the largest helicopter first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance followed without any hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then Sam and David also boarded the helicopter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next were Rodney, Tony, Kent, Henry, and John.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne walked at the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he got on the helicopter, he found that there was only one seat in the corner, and all the seats close to Caleb were occupied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne walked to the corner and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the helicopter took off and flew towards the Lostridge Mountains north of Newport City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Caleb didn't speak, everyone on the plane didn't speak. They didn't even make eye contact with each other but just waited patiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The helicopter was about to reach the Lostridge Mountains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Through the helicopter window, they could see the dense jungle below and the towering and dangerous mountains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lostridge Mountains were an uninhabited area that was inaccessible to ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were all kinds of wild beasts, poisonous insects, and strong magnetic field interference. There was no signal, and the compass could not be used, so it was difficult for ordinary people to leave alive after entering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the place where they held the Branch Bloodline Competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, we're almost there." Finally, Caleb spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at everyone with a smile, and suddenly, he took out two emblems, playing with them casually in his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone looked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, everyone's eyes became excited and their faces were full of greed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Heir's Emblems!"</p><div class="pagination">
