  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the guards from the Bowman family relaxed upon seeing only five </span><span>figures emerge from the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked far too young!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they couldn't gauge the true power of these five due to the Eclipsing Mantra, one thing was clear</span><span>. N</span><span>one of these five were Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they weren't Deity Kings, the guards felt confident. After all, they were all peak Deity Overlords themselves. Even if these newcomers were at the same level, they weren't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Bowman family guards smirked, his confidence radiating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finished chatting? If so, it's time to send you all to hell! Anyone who dares oppose the Paramount Supreme Clan's Bowman family deserves to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and the others halted their conversation, turning their attention to the guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce, eager for action, asked, "Osborne, are these the geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "They're not the geniuses you're hoping for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan is part of the Human Community, and these are just the guards of the Bowman family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's disappointment was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just some guards? I thought I'd finally get a chance to spar with the real deal! But no worries, I'll take these guards down first, and then I'll go after the Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he summoned the massive Trident of Poseidon into his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Trident of Poseidon was unquestionably a top-grade divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in Celestara, such high-tier divine artifacts were rare, and those of even greater power</span><span>, </span><span>the Ultimate divine artifacts</span><span>, </span><span>were exceedingly scarce. Examples of such were the likes of the Supreme Malevolence Sword, which was typically held by the most formidable powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Bryce, he had grown utterly accustomed to the Trident of Poseidon, which aligned seamlessly with his power. Giving him an Ultimate divine artifact would be of no interest; he would refuse such an offer without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!" Bryce shouted, his enthusiasm infectious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra, Mila, and Zoe were equally charged up, their eyes sparkling with battle fervor, while Anastasia remained calm, standing beside Osborne with no intention of joining the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply didn't see the need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! If you're looking for a fight, we'll be happy to oblige! Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the guards sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce laughed heartil</span><span>y and </span><span>charg</span><span>ed </span><span>forward with the Trident of Poseidon raised high, while Kendra, Mila, and Zoe each sought their own opponents without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle erupted in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah felt a surge of urgency; she wanted to jump in and help. After all, Bryce and the others were there to assist her, and she couldn't just stand by and watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could move, Osborne grabbed her arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, you're injured. Stay back! Let them handle this. They've been itching for a </span><span>fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we're not going to help? There are over a dozen peak Deity Overlords! They're all elite talents trained by the Bowman family, each one powerful. I'm worried..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled reassuringly, "Don't worry! They can handle it. Just watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning his gaze back to the fight, he assessed the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce, Kendra, Mila, and Zoe faced off against a total of sixteen Bowman family guards, perfectly matched so that each of them had four opponents to contend with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce, the most eager of the bunch, plunged into the fray, swinging the Trident of Poseidon. The terrifying water elemental force surged around him, transforming into monstrous waves that crashed against the first Bowman family guard in his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bowman family guard hadn't taken the situation seriously at first, but in the next moment, his divine power defense was shattered by the seemingly innocuous waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surging force behind that water crashed through his defenses</span><span> and left</span><span> him severely wounded and sprawled on the ground, his face pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce didn't spare him a glance as he charged forward toward his next target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remarked, unable to contain his excitement, "Bryce's water elemental essence has reached Level Seven! His affinity for water elemental forces far surpasses that of an ordinary person. What starts as gentle water in his hands becomes a lethal weapon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes shifted to Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila wielded light elemental power, her elemental essence even surpassing Bryce's, reaching the mid-Level Seven mark. At that moment, she radiated an angelic glow. As she unleashed her power, the air around her shimmered, and the Bowman family guards began to scream in agony as their divine bodies melted away under her radiant onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive! Mila's light elemental power is truly pure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly turned to Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra had many powers at her disposal, including the ability to lock onto her enemies' energy signatures. Regardless of how far they fled, once she had laid eyes on them, she could hunt them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had just now realized that Kendra's primary focus was fire elemental!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fire elemental essence had also reached Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, flames erupted around her, engulfing her opponents and leading them to let out desperate, piercing screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fire! It's incredible! Who would have thought that she and Bryce were siblings, with one mastering water elemental power and the other fire elemental!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at the irony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he turned his attention to Zoe.</span></p><div class="pagination">
