  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo pointed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne saw a huge mountain belly, which was obviously artificially excavated and was full of reinforced concrete buildings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a small city!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, Osborne saw many clones. Their strength ranged from Class C to Class S. There were hundreds of thousands of them, or maybe more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, there were also some people with lifeless eyes and stiff bodies, some of whom had blonde hair and blue eyes, and some had brown hair and brown eyes, obviously from different countries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne guessed it right, these people should be...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Human Slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Human Slaves was several thousand or even tens of thousands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing was that these Human Slaves were at least in Class A, and many of them were even in Class S. They felt extremely powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Gerardo looked proud and said, "Did you see that? This is my kingdom! Everything here belongs to me, and I am the king here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These clones are my Hyenas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I recently cloned these clones in Class S. I call them 'Jackals!'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And these Human Slaves..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo seemed to be showing off to Osborne and took him around. If it weren't for Osborne being controlled by him and unable to move, he would almost feel like he was not a captive but a guest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo asked with a smile, "How does their strength compare to Sebastian's Draco Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, in addition to this, I also sent 600 Jackals, 3,000 Human Slaves, and 30,000 Hyenas to attack the </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked extremely anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found that he had underestimated the strength of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of clones who were in Class S in the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was not 1,000, but close to 2,000! In addition, there were hundreds of Human Slaves who were in Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were at least more than 5,000 Hyenas and Human Slaves who were in Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a huge force this was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was extremely serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm asking you, which one is stronger, the forces I control or Sebastian's Draco Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned and looked at Gerardo. "Of course you are stronger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne answered truthfully because there was indeed a huge gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Gerardo suddenly laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His laughter was so loud that it hurt people's eardrums, but the other people around him seemed to ignore it and were still busy in their own way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, Gerardo finally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Osborne and said calmly, "Do you know how much effort I have put in for all this? Do you know how much pain I have endured for today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There used to be only one very ordinary cave here! More than 40 years ago, I was defeated by Sebastian and driven out of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. Dragging my heavy injuries, I came here like a wild dog, curled up in this cave, waiting for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I lost! I lost miserably! I lost to Sebastian, who is younger than me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't accept it, so I want revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But by then, I was almost dead! I waited for death like a wounded wild dog, but fate refused to give up on me and gave me a chance to turn over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I found five 'strange' corpses in the deepest part of the cave! You should have guessed it, right? That's right, they are the corpses of five gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goddess Medusa, Wolf God, Minotaur, Vampire God and Titan God!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I ate their flesh, drank their blood, and finally came back to life. All my injuries were healed! Then, I re-established the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and used this place as my base to study these five corpses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It took me over 40 years to finally build everything I have now! I have also fused the bodies of the gods with my own and finally have the opportunity for revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Sebastian must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family must be destroyed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Draco Group will also submit to me and belong to me from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face was filled with madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was here where Gerardo found the bodies of five gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I've explained everything! Now, I'm going to refine you into my Human Slave! Don't worry, and I won't enslave your consciousness. After all, I want you to see how I tortured and killed Sebastian!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I refine you into a Human Slave, your body will become even stronger! It will even surpass Human Slaves who were in Class S, and you will become the most powerful weapon in my hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps, I will let you kill Sebastian for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, Gerardo brought Osborne to a room with many huge glass containers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many naked figures inside those glass containers. They were immersed in a murky liquid, and although they closed their eyes, their bodies were trembling violently as if they were enduring immense pain.</span></p><div class="pagination">
