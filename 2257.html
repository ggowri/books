  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you kidding me! This is just preposterous! Tyson from Fantasia Isle and Marreese from Azure Haven Academy! They've got zero respect for us! They think nothing of the Mystic Sirius Sect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Mystic Sirius Sect were huddled in the spacious courtyard provided by Azure Haven Academy. Their faces were red with a mix of rage and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan said, barely keeping her own temper in check, "Chill out, folks. Let's face it, they're no pushovers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marreese was the champ in the last City Duel, and Tyson came in second. No wonder they're looking down their noses at us. The Mystic Sirius Sect hasn't even cracked the top three in a century!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then shifted her eyes to </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> a calculating look on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But their hubris could be our golden ticket! If they think we're easy pickings, they'll likely drop their guard during the matches. That's when we pounce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if Osborne manages to grab the championship this time, neither Azure Haven Academy nor Fantasia Isle will ever dare to diss us again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar was about to speak up about his doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Winning the title wasn't going to be a walk in the park. Sure, Osborne was a force to be reckoned with, but his cultivation level was still way behind Marreese and Tyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, there was Leroy, the dark horse who had knocked Marreese off his pedestal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what Marreese had said, it was obvious he held Leroy in high regard, which probably meant Leroy was miles ahead of him in terms of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there was Clara from Fantasia Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she'd come in second, she hadn't faced Tyson directly; she'd skipped that match for some odd reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was no slouch either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under these circumstances, it seemed like a pipe dream for Osborne, an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King, to win the city </span><span>duel</span><span> championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar thought it was a stretch even to imagine Osborne making it into the top three, but he kept his thoughts to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne was their last hope. Both he and Bethan were well aware of their own limitations. They might aim for a top-ten finish, but anything better seemed like a wild fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, now that you've sized up Tyson and Marreese, what's your take on them?" Bethan asked, breaking the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a moment to ponder her question before answering, "They pack a real punch. Their power is raw and untamed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan stared at him, waiting for him to say more, but he fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her a quick look. "That's all I can tell for now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan rolled her eyes in exasperation. "Do you think you've got what it takes to beat them? If you're aiming for a top-three finish or even the championship, you're bound to cross paths with them sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a faint smile. "We'll see when the moment arrives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he got to his feet and made a beeline for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, where are you off to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to put some money on the bet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan and Jamar exchanged a look and promptly jumped up, hot on his heels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're coming with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio stepped outside, and this time, they didn't run into Tyson or any trouble. Instead, they encountered several Azure Haven Academy disciples, who pointed and whispered as they passed by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, it's the Mystic Sirius Sect disciples!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that a champion medal on his chest? He's the top disciple from the Mystic Sirius Sect? I heard the champion of this tournament is just an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. That's laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Eight guy can be a champion of Mystic Sirius Sect? What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect is really on the decline! I think it's been a hundred years since they had a disciple in the top three of the city </span><span>duel</span><span>. Thank goodness I didn't join Mystic Sirius Sect; I went with the stronger Azure Haven Academy instead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, the Mystic Sirius Sect will surely come in last among the three Second-tier Powers! If they go up against Leroy, Marreese, or even Pero... they probably won't even last one round!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha! Azure Haven Academy is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In Tempest Fortress City, we're the top dogs, no doubt about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The banter from the Azure Haven Academy disciples reached Jamar and Bethan's ears, and their faces darkened with fury. The contempt in those words was like a slap in the face, stoking the flames of anger within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They balled their fists, their expressions hard as stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on the other hand, stayed cool as a cucumber, seemingly unfazed by the taunts from Azure Haven Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the city duel was just around the corner, set to start tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>more overconfident and cocky</span><span> they were now, the greater the despair they'd feel when the matches kicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, the three of them quickly made their way to the betting area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was packed with people, buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Odds are dropping! Leroy's odds of winning have fallen again! Now it's down to just 1.2 to 1! Ugh, those odds are too low&mdash;there's no profit to be made!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, be happy! At least it's still 1.2 to 1 for now. It'll probably get even lower! With Leroy's strength, who can threaten her in this city duel? Marreese has already acknowledged her; do you really think Tyson from Fantasia Isle can take her down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, Leroy winning is a done deal! If you've got money, put it all on Leroy. It's practically free cash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not so fast! If Leroy's victory was a sure thing, why would the casino still be taking bets? And with those 1.2 odds? I think there's still a chance for an upset, especially if Fantasia Isle or Mystic Sirius Sect pulls a dark horse. Their true strengths are still a mystery; they might surprise us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you talking about Clara from Fantasia Isle and Osborne from Mystic Sirius Sect? Hahaha! Clara's definitely a strong competitor. Her odds are 9.8 to 1, on par with Marreese and Tyson. She's got real muscle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what about that Osborne from Mystic Sirius Sect? What's he doing here? It's been a century since anyone from Mystic Sirius Sect cracked the top three! Winning? That's a pipe dream for the Mystic Sirius Sect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Osborne's odds have shot up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Earlier it was 100 to 1, and now it's soared to 130 to 1! Even his odds of making it into the top three are 25 to 1! And still, no one's willing to bet on him. It's just throwing money away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're spot on... I'd say Leroy's got a 90% shot at winning this city duel! The remaining 10% is split between Marreese, Tyson, and Clara! As for the rest, they don't stand a snowball's chance in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The top three will definitely be a battle between those four! Leroy is 100% guaranteed to make it into the top three, which is why the casino isn't even offering odds on her making it into the top three..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm betting on Leroy to win! I'm putting everything on the line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll bet on Leroy too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to play it safe and just bet on Marreese making the top three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm betting on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was lively, exchanging information and opinions as Osborne, Jamar, and Bethan approached the betting area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Bethan and Jamar exchanged looks of uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had planned to capitalize on everyone's lack of knowledge about Osborne's true strength and the high odds of him making it into the top three or even winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as the moment to place their bets approached, doubt crept in.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
