  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family were utterly shocked to discover that Sene ranked higher than Aresta among the </span><span>Yalynch</span><span> Godsons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are we supposed to win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is only at Class A+. He only managed to beat Aresta because Lance had gravely injured him first. If Aresta had been at his peak, Osborne wouldn't have stood a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sene is ranked eleventh, two spots higher than Aresta, and just one below Gordon, who defeated Owen. There's no way Osborne can win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Owen himself fight with him, he'd likely lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, there's no hope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family stared at Sene, and their faces once again filled with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sene listened with satisfaction to the despairing cries of the Augustine family, his face </span><span>brimming with confidence and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He expected Osborne to share their despair, but when he looked at Osborne, he found his expression unchanged, which made Sene frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, he asked, "Aren't you afraid of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and asked in confusion, "Why should I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sene snorted coldly, "You're just at Class A+. You defeat Aresta when he was heavily injured. My ranking is higher than Aresta's, which means I'm stronger. Besides, I'm at my peak. So, you should be scared of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, looking a bit exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You sure talk a lot. I know your ranking is higher than Aresta's. Just get on with it. I still have two more opponents to deal with, so let's not waste any more time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, Sene's anger erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beat me? In your dreams! If you're so eager to be defeated, I'll grant your wish! Taste the wrath of light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Sene finished speaking, his body instantly turned into a blazing sun, radiating an intense light that blinded the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! He's also a light elemental metahuman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His ranking is only one below Gordon's, who's also a light elemental metahuman. They should be equally powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gordon defeated Owen. I don&rsquo;t think Osborne stands a chance against Sene!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family sank further into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Owen sneered, knowing all too well how difficult it was to deal with light elemental power. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twisted light had made it impossible for him to locate his opponent's true position before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of Dissolving Light was at least as potent as Thunder Explosion, and its speed was even more incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's finished!" Owen thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dissolving Light!" Sene shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furious with Osborne, Sene unleashed his ultimate move right away. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening roar, the intermediate level skill of light elemental power, Dissolving Light, exploded. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its</span><span> terrifying beam pierced straight through Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could react, a massive blood hole appeared in his chest, and then his entire body seemed to explode in the blinding light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of shock spread across Sene's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it really that easy? Wait, something's not right! Dissolving Light is powerful, but its power is concentrated on a line, only causing piercing damage. How could his body explode like that? Something's off!" He murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sene sensed something was wrong, but he couldn't figure out what. All he could see was that Osborne's body had indeed vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" At that moment, Emma suddenly let out a gasp in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been watching the scene unfold from the </span><span>sidelines..</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?" Matthew asked urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his strength was more significant than Emma's, he couldn't see anything clearly in the intense light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worried, he asked, "What's happened to Osborne? Did he block the attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma frowned without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she said, "Osborne's in big trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Did he lose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew sighed, "I guess it was inevitable. After all, he's only at Class A+. Expecting him to pull off a miracle was too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma glanced at him and said calmly, "I didn't say he was going to lose. Quite the opposite. If nothing goes wrong, he's about to win. But the way he wins is going to cause him a lot of trouble. Just wait and see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew was stunned, unable to make sense of her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, something on the stage changed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful beam of light suddenly erupted, so bright it forced everyone to close their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Dissolving Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this Dissolving Light wasn't controlled by Sene. It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, and there was no figure in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, a blood-curdling scream echoed across the stage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beam of light twisted, revealing a figure whose chest had been pierced by Dissolving Light, leaving a strange wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked the crowd was that this figure wasn't Osborne. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Sene!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sene stared in disbelief at the hole in his chest, his face filled with shock and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the other members of the Rosenthal family shot to their feet, unable to believe their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the light twisted again, revealing Osborne behind Sene. He was completely unharmed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then struck Sene in the back with a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sene spat out blood as he fell to the ground, struggling to rise but unable to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This victory had come too easy. Sene was a light elemental metahuman, and Osborne realized that his control over light elemental power was even more remarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sene could twist light to hide his true position and use Dissolving Light, but so could Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference was that when Osborne twisted the light to conceal his true location, Sene couldn't see through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sene's light manipulation was useless against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, Osborne had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to the members of the Rosenthal family, Osborne said calmly, "Who's next?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
