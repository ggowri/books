  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo, aren't you being a bit hasty? Clarissa is still very young and not ready for marriage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Barlyn frowned and spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked at him with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna hesitated for a moment, then added, "Indeed, it does seem rushed. Clarissa is only twenty. Maybe we should wait a bit longer for the wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too hasty? I think it's just right. Besides, it's not me who's in a hurry, but Sir Radcliffe. I can wait, but how much longer can your Radcliffe family afford to wait? Do you dare to wait?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's words left Clarissa and the others looking displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Apollo's words, it seemed that the Radcliffe family was in trouble, which was why they were eager to marry Clarissa to Apollo to solve their problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no idea exactly what the problem was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, I hope to have the wedding soon. I won't be staying in Mayby City for long. After the wedding with Clarissa, I plan to take her abroad for development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, I will naturally resolve the Radcliffe family's issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo wore a smug expression as if everything was under his control and everyone had to follow his arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor was suffocating Donna and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, I will discuss this with Sir Radcliffe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna gritted her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to dwell on this matter, she changed the topic. "The most pressing issue now is that Clarissa is being targeted by The Aberrants! If we can't ensure her safety, nothing else matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo sneered, "The Aberrants? A disreputable organization expelled from Rosmandi! They wouldn't dare enter Rosmandi in force, lest the Godfather deal with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they don't dare enter in force, they still pose a threat to Clarissa! We must find a way to ensure her safety. Do you have any suggestions, Mr. Chevalier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna directly threw the problem at Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna thought to herself, "Apollo, you're so arrogant and think you're so capable, right? Since you're so capable, then figure out a way to solve the problem of The Aberrants sending people to assassinate Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo clearly understood this was Donna's test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly, "No problem, I'll handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He beckoned to a subordinate and whispered to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, he wore a confident smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke calmly, "I've heard that Skyefall Security Services has a Class A defense system from the Draco Group? If we install this defense system here, Clarissa's safety should be ensured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's eyes lit up, "That would indeed solve the problem! However, many powerful forces are eyeing that Class A defense system, and Skyefall Security might not be willing to lease it to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo laughed and said confidently, "Don't worry. If I mentioned it, I have confidence! The Chevalier family still holds some sway in Skyefall. Even the Draco Group must give my family some respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, Skyefall Security has been sold to a new owner. Although we don't know who the new owner is, I believe that if I personally negotiate, they won't refuse me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll secure that Class A defense system for sure! Consider it a gift for Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Apollo looked proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna felt a bit of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could indeed lease the Class A defense system from Skyefall Security and install it in the manor, Clarissa wouldn't have to worry about her safety within the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the Radcliffe family didn't have the influence to make Skyefall Security lease them the defense system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If Apollo is confident, then let him negotiate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, are you really sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo smirked. "You'll see whether I'm sure or not! Why not seize the day and go now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go to Skyefall Security together. I'll negotiate personally and aim to have the Class A defense system installed by tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna hesitated for a moment before nodding. "Alright! I'll make arrangements now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a large convoy departed from the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the head of security, Osborne finally got to sit in Clarissa's car and personally drove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn sat in the front passenger seat, with Donna and Clarissa in the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, what's happening to our Radcliffe family? Can't we just not marry Clarissa to Apollo? That guy is so arrogant, it's unbearable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn couldn't help but complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna replied coldly, "Keep such comments to yourself. If you dare say that outside, I'll break your legs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for what's happening with the Radcliffe family, it's pointless to tell you. You can't change anything! Apollo may be arrogant, but he has the right to be!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget, even Sir Radcliffe couldn't negotiate to acquire that Class A defense system, regardless of how much money he offered. Apollo, however, is confident he can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of this alone, we can't afford to offend him right now."</span></p><div class="pagination">
