  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ultimately, Satan's Eye just doesn't cut it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eamon's realm is two levels above mine, and the time power I gain from it loses its edge when I use it against him. I can only freeze his time for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how powerful Ophelia's time power truly is? Only she could unleash such a terrifying fighting style!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The last time I faced her, I was utterly helpless! I can only imagine how strong she's become now," Osborne thought, his expression turning grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ophelia was the reincarnation of the God of Time. Now that she had recovered her past memories, she was essentially the real deal. Armed with the knowledge of a top-tier Deity King, her power was bound to skyrocket far beyond anything he could ever hope to match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew all too well how deeply Ophelia loathed him. It was only a matter of time before she would come for him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne wasn't a match for her, Ophelia would relish in humiliating him, crushing him underfoot and shattering his dignity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was something he simply couldn't accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether Ophelia was his ex-wife or the God of Time was irrelevant; Osborne would never allow her to trample on his pride again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia's past self was a top-tier Deity King warrior! She could go toe-to-toe with Lord Malevolence and alter the very fabric of time on Blue Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And here I am, feeling smug because I'm toying with a Transcendent Deity? Compared to a top-tier Deity King, this Transcendent Deity is nothing but an insect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Ophelia regained her full strength, she could wipe out countless Transcendent Deity warriors with a mere breath! So, while I can mess around with a Transcendent Deity now, it's far too early to be feeling proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to wrap this up quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, Osborne regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to change his approach. While using Temporal Stasis had given him the upper hand and ensured his safety, it wasn't the most efficient way to finish the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne abandoned the time power and shifted to his preferred combat style.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his full power like a supernova blazing with unbridled intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used Medusa's Gaze, a blinding light engulfing Eamon's form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being two levels above Osborne, Eamon found himself sluggish, the effects of Medusa's Gaze weighing heavily on him. Though he wasn't fully petrified, his movements were significantly hindered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Eamon growled, feeling as if his joints were filled with concrete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every step felt like a monumental effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he struggled, Osborne vanished from sight once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it wasn't time power at play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's eyes widened in realization. He instinctively attacked the empty space behind him, thinking Osborne would be there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his strike met only air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had used spatial power this time, slipping into a parallel dimension through Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this alternate space, Osborne watched Eamon, whose face was a mask of wariness, a smirk creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to end this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, I'm an unseen assassin, weaving through the fabric of space!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transcendent Deity warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm grip on the Goddess of Grain's scythe, Osborne felt an overwhelming surge of power coursing through his right hand. He erupted from the parallel dimension, reappearing directly behind Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one swift motion, he swung the scythe down toward Eamon's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force behind the blow was staggering; the scythe sliced through the air with a speed that left no room for reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Eamon sensed the danger, the razor-sharp blade had already struck, cleaving through his defenses like they were made of paper before biting into flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to freeze for Eamon as his body halted mid-air, with shock and </span><span>confusion flooding his eyes, which were quickly replaced by sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly reached up, his fingers brushing against his neck, where a pristine surface had suddenly turned crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Eamon touched it, a thin line of blood appeared, rapidly oozing from the wound, a gruesome reminder of his impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ring of blood began to encircle his neck, growing wider and deeper with every passing second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..." Eamon stammered, trying to speak, but the mere act of opening his mouth widened the gash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed forth, spilling like a fountain, each heartbeat marking the end of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's eyes were wide with fear and disbelief as he locked onto Osborne, but before he could utter another word, his head suddenly detached from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Goddess of Grain's scythe, wielded with Osborne's immense strength, had not only shattered Eamon's Ethereal Glow defenses but had also severed his Divine Body, ending the life of a Transcendent Deity warrior in a matter of moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their battle had lasted less than ten breaths.</span></p><div class="pagination">
