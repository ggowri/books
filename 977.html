  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't bother to conceal his presence, and it wasn't long before the Lambert family members caught wind of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who's there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Watch out! The Eityreia Organization's assassins are back! Surround him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kill him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, a dozen figures surged forward, encircling Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each one was a high-ranking member of the Lambert family, their faces etched with exhaustion and fury, a palpable aura of danger radiating from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among them was a familiar face&mdash;Stuart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kill him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The others shouted, their voices a chorus of hostility as they prepared to strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just then, Stuart finally recognized Osborne's face through the chaos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart shouted, raising his hands to halt the impending attack, "Stop!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone, hold on! He's not one of assassins. This is Osborne&mdash;our ally!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert family members froze, their expressions shifting from aggression to astonishment as they processed his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? That's Osborne? The one who defeated all challengers at the Honor Quest Ceremony, the one who made history?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He looks so young!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's the first from Rosmandi to achieve a hundred consecutive victories and the first to complete the Honor Quest Ceremony! I can't believe we're finally meeting him in person!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Augustine family sent him to assist us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The seasoned fighters of the Lambert family looked at Osborne with a mix of awe and disbelief. Most of them hadn't attended the Honor Quest Ceremony, so this was their first encounter with the legendary figure. However, they had heard countless tales of his exploits from Rhett, Stuart, and others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart stepped closer, excitement bubbling in his voice. "Osborne, you finally made it! If you hadn't come, the Lambert family would've been in deep trouble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, where are the others? How many did you bring? Are they still outside? We need to get them in here right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled, shaking his head, "Stuart, my friend, there's no need for that. I came alone this time. The Augustine family only sent me to help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere shifted dramatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The initial thrill of having reinforcements from the Augustine family turned into a heavy silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait, what?" Stuart frowned, disbelief creeping into his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sigh rippled through the crowd as one of the Lambert family fighters muttered, "So it was only one. We got our hopes up for nothing. What can one person do against our current situation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, he's Osborne, a top-tier talent among the younger generation, but he's still just Class AAA. No Class S strength to back him up. Even if he's strong, he can't solve our problems alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's not blame the Augustine family too much. I heard the Aberrants has launched another war against them. They're barely holding it together themselves. At least they managed to send Osborne to us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are we really facing extinction?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The expressions of the Lambert family members darkened, filled with despair and anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart sighed, placing a hand on Osborne's shoulder. He said, "Regardless of the situation, we're genuinely grateful for your help, Osborne. But you should leave while you can. One person can't change the tide for the Lambert family. We can't let you get dragged into this mess!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow, a determined glint in his eyes. "Stuart, I'm already here. I can't just turn back now. So tell me, what's actually going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart furrowed his brow, ready to urge Osborne to reconsider.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne was resolute; there was no way he was leaving now. With a heavy sigh, Stuart relented and said, "Let me take you to see the clan leader. We can talk on the way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You all continue patrolling and stay alert," Stuart added before leading Osborne deeper into the Lambert family's stronghold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&#21543;f</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn that Eityreia Organization! They're hell-bent on wiping us out! Just because Rhett saved some woman, we've got a target painted on our backs now&mdash;one of their high-ups is out for revenge, and we're caught in the crossfire!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's face was twisted with anger, but he fought to keep his composure. "The situation for the Lambert family is dire. Since the day before yesterday, we've seen top assassins from the Eityreia Organization lurking around us. In just two days, over fifty of our people have been assassinated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"More than twenty of them were Class AA or higher within our core ranks! And we don't even know how many total killers they've sent; many victims were taken out in their sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're all huddled together now&mdash;no one dares step outside the family's perimeter. The moment you leave, you're risking your life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even so, we still lose members. Our clan leader tried to confront them personally and ended up getting hurt instead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eityreia Organization probably deployed at least two Class S assassins, maybe more!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Stuart shared the grim news, Osborne's expression turned serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "At least two Class S killers? This is really getting complicated."</p><div class="pagination">
