  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Everyone, assemble immediately.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, all members of Clarissa&rsquo;s Bodyguard Unit gathered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The head bodyguard, Paul, inspected everyone&rsquo;s equipment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he saw that all members of the third and fourth Bodyguard Units were armed to the teeth, his expression changed slightly, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In fact, he even gave a nod of approval.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done well. Ms. Radcliffe made the right choice in hiring you,&rdquo; Paul praised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Had Osborne not already known Paul was problematic, anyone would find it hard to believe that Paul was an insider for the Aberrants, given his current demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before long, Clarissa and Donna appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain Paul, let&rsquo;s head out.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The security on the road is in your hands. Make sure everything goes smoothly.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul nodded firmly at Donna&rsquo;s words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Donna Radcliffe, rest assured, nothing will go wrong.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Paul signaled everyone to start boarding the vehicles. He personally led the Personal Guards and the first Bodyguard Unit, a total of twenty people, to guard Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The second, third, and fourth Bodyguard Units, consisting of thirty people, formed the outer ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other six patrol groups remained at the manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Altogether, a fifty-member bodyguard team in more than a dozen vehicles surrounded the luxury car at the center as they left the Radcliffe Manor and headed towards Skyefall Security Services outside the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne and Violet were in the same vehicle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Per Paul&rsquo;s arrangement, their car was at the rear of the convoy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sharon from the third unit was positioned at the front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, what should we do next?&rdquo; Violet asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was troubled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Can you contact Donna Radcliffe without alerting Paul? I need to tell her something crucial. Otherwise, this trip will be very dangerous.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Violet&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She frowned. &ldquo;I can contact Ms. Donna directly, but she&rsquo;s in the same car as Paul and Ms. Clarissa.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That complicates things.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne knew that Donna was the main force in countering the Aberrants&rsquo; attack. If something happened to Donna, everyone would be in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul and the Aberrants were aware of this, too, so Paul&rsquo;s plan was to poison Donna in advance, rendering her powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne had to warn Donna about Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, he hadn&rsquo;t found the opportunity yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Donna and Paul are in the same car. Paul could act at any moment</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> I can&rsquo;t wait any longer. I must warn her immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With this in mind, Osborne took out his phone and found a number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was Clarissa&rsquo;s private number she had given him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I hope Clarissa trusts me. Otherwise, my plan will be ruined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne quickly typed a message and sent it to Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, inside Clarissa&rsquo;s car, Paul was driving personally, with Clarissa and Donna seated in the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Aunt Donna, why do you think the Draco Group wants to sell Skyefall Security Services?&rdquo; Clarissa asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Logically, Skyefall Security Services is doing well, with annual profits exceeding a billion dollars. The Draco Group shouldn&rsquo;t be selling it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s happening. Maybe Godfather has special reasons. Someone as influential as Godfather isn&rsquo;t for us to speculate about.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the mention of Godfather, a look of respect appeared on Clarissa&rsquo;s face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She nodded. &ldquo;I hope we can buy it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna smiled bitterly. &ldquo;The chances are slim. Even if Skyefall Security Services is for sale, not everyone qualifies to buy it. For the Radcliffe family, the hope is minimal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;In my opinion, we shouldn&rsquo;t waste our time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Clarissa looked disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Aunt, should we go back then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe these days. I don&rsquo;t want anyone else to get hurt because of me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna hesitated after Clarissa spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Paul finally chimed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, Ms. Donna Radcliffe, I think we do have a chance. If Skyefall Security Services is up for sale, anyone can bid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;As long as the bid is high enough, the Draco Group has no reason not to sell to us. Regarding safety, don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ve made thorough arrangements. With so many bodyguards, and with Ms. Donna Radcliffe and me protecting you, there will be no problems.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa was grateful. &ldquo;Paul, thank you for protecting me during this time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, I was raised by the Radcliffe family. Without the Radcliffe family, I would&rsquo;ve starved as a child. Protecting you is my duty, even if it costs my life.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul then took out a lunchbox.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, Ms. Donna Radcliffe, it&rsquo;s a long journey. You should rest. I know you love candies. These candies are handmade from the century-old shop. I bought them personally this morning. Try them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s eyes lit up at his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled. &ldquo;Captain Paul, thank you so much. You&rsquo;re very thoughtful.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, they were about to taste the candies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Neither noticed the cold smile forming at the corner of Paul&rsquo;s mouth as he drove.</p><div class="pagination">
