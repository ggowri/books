  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were just Lord League under siege, Osborne wouldn't lift a finger to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had no ties to Lord League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, Lord League was far too foolish; if not for their own blunders, the alliance of the Dark Deity Legion would have been systematically advancing on the Augustine family, where a fully prepared Osborne awaited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne had been secluded for three days, dedicating himself to the creation of a Dimensional Microcosm, his companion, Sebastian, and the rest hadn't been idle. They had mobilized over 200 thousand members of the Draco Armed Services Branch, </span><span>setting</span><span> traps and making significant preparations in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Dark Deity Legion's coalition came, Osborne was confident he could inflict heavy losses, and with the help of the Prophet Alliance warriors, he could even wipe them out entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, due to Lord League's reckless actions, the Dark Deity Legion changed their initial strategy. Instead of targeting the Augustine family, they turned their sights on the misguided Lord League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make matters worse, nearly twenty elite warriors from the Prophet Alliance were trapped there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they perished, the Prophet Alliance would be severely crippled, and Osborne would have to face the Dark Deity Legion coalition alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a decent relationship with the Prophet Alliance, and Jackie had helped him in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when Jackie came pleading for help, he couldn't turn a blind eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me where they are!" he demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Jackie relayed the location of Lord League's Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few thousand miles away in </span><span>Lordia</span><span> Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne locked onto the position and initiated interdimensional travel, taking Jackie with him across the vast distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they landed, Osborne immediately sensed a powerful surge of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It pulsed through the air, the result of a tremendous explosion; though it was over a hundred miles away, its intensity sent shivers down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if half of Blue Planet could feel the shockwave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A creeping dread filled Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please tell me that's not the Dimensional Microcosm of Lord League that just blew up," he mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie's face drained of color as he felt the energy ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no! It's over! The Dark Deity Legion has destroyed Lord League's Dimensional Microcosm! That kind of explosive energy can only mean one thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord League is done for! Anyone trapped inside&mdash;there's no way they could have escaped! My predecessors from the Prophet Alliance... they're likely..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie couldn't finish; fear etched deeper across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly reassured him, "Mr. Flores, don't panic! The elders of the Prophet Alliance are Transcendent Deity warriors; they would've sensed the danger and fled in time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay here, I'll go and rescue them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne set Jackie down and sprinted towards the explosion's source, entering the parallel space by activating his Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He covered miles in no time, tearing through the air until the sounds of battle reached his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw was chaos incarnate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion, along with the Pantheon League and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, had unleashed everything they had&mdash;thousands of warriors, all Superior Deity and Transcendent Deity, the latter numbering at least a hundred and fifty strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition was far more formidable than Osborne had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, their opponents numbered fewer than a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion of Lord League's Dimensional Microcosm nearly wiped them out entirely. Fewer than a hundred managed to escape in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Including the close to twenty survivors from the Prophet Alliance, only about eighty were left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was heavily wounded, surrounded by over a thousand Superior Deities and Transcendent Deities from the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were filled with nothing but fear and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a pipe dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tripartite coalition of the Dark Deity Legion was nearly ten times their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they could do was huddle together, desperately trying to hold out, hoping against hope for some miracle or for reinforcements to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, they had already given up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that even if help came, it wouldn't change the outcome; it couldn't match the might of the Dark Deity Legion's tripartite coalition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Blue Planet's major powers were few and far between.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Dark Deity Legion, the Pantheon League, and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization now almost annihilating Lord League and trapping half of the Prophet Alliance's elite, only remnants of the Prophet Alliance and </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> Augustine family were left standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could half a Prophet Alliance and the Augustine family really save them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't think so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Utterly hopeless, their hearts sank into a bottomless abyss.</span></p><div class="pagination">
