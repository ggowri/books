  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne hadn't had the chance to scavenge the Essence Crystals from Zone 1, which belonged to the Royston family, he still walked away with an unimaginable amount of Essence Crystals from the No. 13 mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even begin to calculate the exact total; doing so would take far too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had a rough estimate, and it was already a staggering figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top-grade Essence Crystals alone reached 14 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the mid-grade ones, the number was even more astronomical&mdash;definitely over one and a half billion, possibly reaching two billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With 100 thousand mid-grade Essence Crystals consumed in just two days, that was hardly a concern for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When one possessed two billion, three billion, or even four billion in wealth, would one really fret over spending 100 thousand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, Osborne certainly wouldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he converted all those top-grade and mid-grade Essence Crystals into low-grade ones, the total would surpass 500 billion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five hundred billion Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one in Wild Flame City could rival his wealth, not even close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, those so-called major powers were far behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a squad leader in the Wild Flame Army, Lachlan received a mere two thousand low-grade Essence Crystals as his monthly allowance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did 500 billion </span><span>mean</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, it meant he wouldn't have to worry about running out of Essence Crystals for a long time. His only concern would be figuring out how to spend them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, handing Betty a Dimensional Bag, "Don't stress about the Essence Crystal consumption. If you run low, just come to me! Here, take another 50 thousand top-grade Essence Crystals to start with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Use them as needed. If things get dicey, pump those top-grade Crystals into the divine power shield to boost its strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty stood there, stunned, her eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, you're giving me fifty thousand top-grade Essence Crystals?" she gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was enough to sustain them for a long time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't wrap her head around just how many Essence Crystals her leader had amassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, didn't linger on her astonishment. Instead, he turned his attention to Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren was watching Osborne with a mix of anticipation and anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne left, he had hinted that upon his return, he might have a way to heal them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Osborne was back, he wondered if their injuries truly could be treated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hope and fear mingled in Darren's heart as he awaited the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Darren's apprehension, Osborne smiled gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Pollitt, come with me for a moment! I can't guarantee a hundred percent success, but I'm willing to give it a shot. However, there are a few things we need to discuss first, and you'll need to make your own decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne led Darren into a nearby room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's expression fluctuated, shifting between joy and fear. "Is Mr. Lachlan Swift really capable of treating them? Even if he's not absolutely certain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the best news he could have hoped for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what did Mr. Lachlan Swift mean by his next words? What else is there to clarify about such a good opportunity? Shouldn't we just proceed with the treatment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren, feeling a mix of hope and anxiety, stepped into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Pollitt, please have a seat," Osborne invited, motioning for Darren to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, he continued, "You understand how severe your injuries are. The source of your divine power has been destroyed. To be honest, healing you through normal means is impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless the former Goddess of Life were to resurrect, or another individual with profound mastery of life power appears, you will remain incapacitated for the rest of your lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, Darren's face fell, a shadow of despair crossing his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren nodded vigorously. "Mr. Lachlan Swift, you're right! If it weren't for you, we'd have resigned ourselves to being useless for the rest of our lives. But since you've hinted that there might be a special way to help us, does that mean we actually have a chance at recovery?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever it takes, we're ready to go for it! We'll pay any price just to get our strength back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We still want to fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes shone with unwavering determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and got straight to the point. "Alright! I'll be frank with you. I do have a significant chance of curing you! Even if I can't do it now, I will be able to in the future. However, my method involves altering your bodies. This modification won't have any other side effects, but... after the transformation, you will still be you, with your memories and soul intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, your bodies will be genetically altered to remain absolutely loyal to me, unable to rebel against me, not even being able to entertain such thoughts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched Darren closely, gauging his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren cut him off, breathing heavily with urgency. "Mr. Lachlan Swift, no need to hold back! I'm all in! My comrades will feel the same!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've saved our lives, and we've already sworn our loyalty to you. We would never betray you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, yes! We're willing to do this!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
