  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hazy figure materialized in the void, gradually solidifying into a familiar form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Jethro, Osborne's grandfather!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated the resurrection ability of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, using the previously copied life essence of Jethro to bring him back to life perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire process was incredibly swift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm not dead?" Jethro stammered, his mind racing as he recalled the moment of his self-detonation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his intact body, he felt as if his brain had short-circuited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro mused, "Could it be that everything before was just an illusion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I finally break free from some kind of nightmare?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, how could I still be alive after that explosion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his grandfather in such a daze, Osborne felt a pang of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if there's a glitch in the resurrection? Is his memory off? Or worse, has he become senile?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought weighed heavily on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his first resurrection attempt since merging with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and if there were any side effects, it could lead to serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Jethro soon snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he spotted Osborne nearby, his surprise was palpable. "Osborne, what are you doing here? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro seemed to be functioning normally after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then explained the effects of absolute guardianship without holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're saying I really was dead? But before I kicked the bucket, you managed to get here with that special ability of yours&mdash;this 'absolute guardianship'&mdash;to copy my life essence and then resurrect me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Resurrection?! Is that even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the Goddess of Life couldn't pull that off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro was utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea that someone could come back to life after death shook the foundations of his centuries of experience. If he hadn't experienced it himself, he wouldn't have believed a word of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a sudden realization struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Bram and Trevor? If you arrived before my self-detonation, did you see whether my explosion hurt them? Did they notice you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Grandpa, both Bram and Trevor are dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Jethro's eyes bulged. "My self-detonation was powerful, but it shouldn't have killed them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bram is an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King; even if he took the full brunt of my explosion, he should've only been seriously injured. How could he possibly be dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jethro spoke, an unsettling thought struck him, and he turned to Osborne, his expression shifting. "Wait a minute, did you kill them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, then briefly recounted the events that unfolded after Jethro's explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke casually, but Jethro was left utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Bram and Trevor; a more formidable foe had appeared&mdash;Icy Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro was all too familiar with Icy Nine, the right-hand man of Lord Malevolence and one of the Nine Dark Sovereigns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Light would think twice before facing the Nine Dark Sovereigns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Icy Nine ranked last among them, and Osborne had managed to suppress his cultivation level from Ascension Five to Ascension Four, it was still hard for Jethro to fathom how Osborne could have defeated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But clearly, Osborne had no reason to deceive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything he said was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro gasped, his eyes wide with disbelief as he looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of their first meeting a few months ago flooded back to him. At that time, Osborne had been merely a mid-stage Deity King. To someone like Jethro, a Supernal Deity King, Osborne had seemed like a promising talent but was still leagues away from being a true warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Trevor, an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, had been able to push Osborne to his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, just a few short months later, Osborne had grown to a level that left Jethro in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor, in comparison, was nothing more than a stray dog that Osborne could easily kick aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Bram, who had once severely injured Jethro and forced him into self-detonation, was no match for Osborne now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Icy Nine, one of the Nine Dark Sovereigns, had been taken down by him as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow! Just wow!" Jethro struggled to contain his excitement, slapping Osborne's shoulder with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was his grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger Osborne became, the happier Jethro felt&mdash;more than even his own breakthroughs in cultivation. Tears welled in his eyes, and Jethro couldn't help but feel a rush of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It's a shame that we haven't found Osborne's parents!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only Osborne's parents were here to see how amazing he's become; they would be so proud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you head back for now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to go to the Sanctum of Light and share this incredible news with the esteemed God of Light!" Jethro exclaimed, his voice bubbling with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The death of Icy Nine was monumental news for the entire Human Community in the West Zone, especially with the impending war against the Dark Deity Legion. If they could spread the word, it would surely boost morale among the humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro couldn't wait to share this good news with the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been under immense pressure lately, and he hoped this revelation would lift her spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne stopped him in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, he said, "Grandpa, is the God of Light really trustworthy? Right now, only you know about my killing Icy Nine. If she finds out, could it lead to problems?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd prefer to keep my strength under wraps for now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro paused, taken aback by Osborne's concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he chuckled, "Oh, you silly boy! Of course, the esteemed God of Light is trustworthy! If we can't trust her, then who can we trust? If it weren't for her and the God of Night, our Human Community in the West Zone would have been wiped out by the Dark Deity Legion ages ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry! If you don't want your strength revealed, I won't say it was you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll just say that Icy Nine, Bram, and Trevor tried to ambush me, but a mysterious warrior from the Human Community showed up and took them all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement. "That sounds better!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's keep the absolute guardianship thing under wraps too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now it was Jethro's turn to frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, he said, "Osborne, since you have absolute guardianship, can you replicate the life essence of all the humans in the West Zone? If we do that, even if we ultimately fail, we could..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jethro could finish, Osborne shook his head, cutting him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, let's not get ahead of ourselves! The absolute guardianship has its limits. Copying the life essence of five million people from the Hudson family already put a strain on me! With my current strength, I could manage maybe ten million at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the entire Human Community in the West Zone? There are billions! I can't replicate everyone's life essence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Jethro felt a wave of disappointment wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I see your point. I guess I was being a bit greedy. Such a miraculous ability surely can't come without restrictions. I'll head to the esteemed God of Light now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Jethro was about to leave, Osborne called out to him once more.</span></p><div class="pagination">
