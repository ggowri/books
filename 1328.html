  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Prophet Alliance looked at Osborne with pride, expecting to see astonishment on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were disappointed; instead of being impressed, Osborne frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad, but still not enough," he remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wondered, "Not enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did he say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Osborne really think our strength isn't sufficient?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several members frowned, and a few even appeared a bit angry, feeling underestimated by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly and said, "Mr. Pike, the calamity you foresaw stems from the Dark Deity. The Dark Deities awakening on Blue Planet have formed an alliance called the Dark Deity Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dark Deity Legion?!" Eddie and the others gasped in shock, recognizing the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie spoke solemnly. "If it's the Dark Deity Legion, then we're in trouble. While the Legion on Blue Planet may not be extremely powerful, as you mentioned, the Prophet Alliance alone might struggle to handle them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should contact the Pantheon League, Eityreia Organization, and the Lord League. Only by uniting our major forces can we hope to defeat the Dark Deity Legion on Blue Planet and eliminate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's unfortunate that the Court of the Sun has left Blue Planet; otherwise, we could have sought their aid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed anxious as he continued, "Godfather, I must reach out to these other major forces urgently!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, saying, "Mr. Pike, I haven't finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need to contact the Pantheon League or Eityreia Organization because this calamity involves more than just the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Both the Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization have pledged allegiance to the Dark Deity Legion and Lord Malevolence. They've betrayed humanity and plan to join forces in three days to attack the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We face not only the Dark Deity Legion but also the Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie was stunned, eyes wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! The Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization have betrayed humanity and submitted to the Dark Deity Legion and Lord Malevolence? How could they possibly do that? They are human deities! They can't serve Lord Malevolence, the destroyer of Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disbelief flashed across the faces of the Prophet Alliance members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm. "Though you may not believe it, this is the truth. I have no reason to deceive you&mdash;after all, when they attack in three days, you'll see it for yourself. Lying to you serves no purpose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie and his group fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions turned grim. If dealing with the Dark Deity Legion alone was uncertain, adding the Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization into the mix made the threat far greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only logical for Osborne to say their strength was insufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, Eddie asked, "Godfather, do you have a plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a confident smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, and Eityreia Organization plan to annihilate the Augustine family, the Lord League, and the Prophet Alliance. Similarly, I aim to eliminate them once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm planning to wait for their arrival and capture them all in one go. However, their combined strength is formidable, and I'm not entirely confident. But with the Prophet Alliance and the Lord League by our side, our chances improve significantly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Osborne intends to take down not just the Dark Deity Legion but also the Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such audacity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What gives Osborne such confidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, witnessing Osborne's unwavering determination, Eddie chose his words carefully. "This is about the lives of nearly ten billion people on Blue Planet. If the Dark Deity Legion conquers Blue Planet, humanity could become nothing more than their prey, slaughtered at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, the Prophet Alliance will fully support your efforts. Every available warrior will gather at here within three days to help fend off the assault from these three forces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne nodded in appreciation. "We really appreciate that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie waved it off. "It's all for the sake of humanity on Blue Planet. Godfather, given the urgency of the situation, I won't stay any longer. I'll head out immediately to contact the Lord League and invite them to join our coalition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile, knowing that the Prophet Alliance reaching out to the Lord League increased the likelihood of securing their support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be here, awaiting everyone's arrival."</span></p><div class="pagination">
