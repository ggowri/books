  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian could see that his father was utterly terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, Dave had dared to give orders to Osborne and even acted like he was the elder. Now, realizing that Osborne was the new Godfather of Rosmandi, he looked like a deer caught in headlights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian complained, frustration bubbling over, "Dad! I told you the Godfather has come to help the Carey family! You didn't believe me, and now look at the mess you're in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I..." Dave stammered, his body shaking from fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thoughts raced through his mind. "The rumors say that the new Godfather, Osborne, is a ruthless killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if he holds a grudge against me for being so rude?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if he decides to wipe out my entire family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Dave was overwhelmed with fear, regret, and guilt, tears welling up in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, watching the scene unfold, couldn't help but think, "Am I really that terrifying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Rihanna stepped in, her voice steady and reassuring. "Dad, don't be scared! The Godfather is a good person. If he wasn't, he wouldn't have come here to help us! All those rumors about him were wrong. He won't hold your ignorance against you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement. "Mr. Dave Carey, there's no need for concern. I bear you no ill will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, Dave finally managed to regain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot an irritated glare at Cillian and the others. "Knowing the Godfather was coming to help us, why didn't you call me sooner? I could've been prepared for this! Now I look like a fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian's expression turned defensive. "Dad, we tried calling, but no one picked up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave fell silent, realizing he had been too busy battling Dark Exotic Beasts to answer his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly shifted gears, addressing Osborne with newfound respect, "Godfather, I can't believe you came personally! This means Eidolon City is saved! I'll summon the Reinhart family, the Fanning family, and the other major factions in Eidolon City right away. They'll be on standby for your orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved a hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need to call them. Since they've chosen to abandon Eidolon City and its million innocent citizens, they don't need to come back. Rosmandi doesn't lack wealthy families or Ancient Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who run away in a crisis, without a sense of responsibility, should not have a place in this city."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood the implications: the other factions in Eidolon City were doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words had sealed their fate, and it was clear they were destined for decline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, relief washed over Dave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was grateful he hadn't chosen to flee like the others, abandoning the lives of the million citizens of Eidolon City. Instead, he had decided to stand his ground with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had chosen otherwise, the Carey family would have been finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to Dave, smiling, "Mr. Dave Carey, from now on, the fate of Eidolon City rests on the shoulders of your family. If you face any difficulties, don't hesitate to reach out to the Augustine family in Newport City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave felt a surge of excitement, his body trembling with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's endorsement, the rise of the Carey family was all but guaranteed. With the support of the Augustine family, they were on the brink of becoming the leading family in Eidolon City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank... thank you, Godfather!" he stammered, overwhelmed with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely nodded, his gaze shifting toward the massive rift in Herbmaster Canyon, where danger still loomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Herbmaster Canyon stretched three miles wide and ran for fifteen miles long. Smack in the center, a massive fissure opened like the jaws of an abyss over a mile wide, three miles long, and seemingly bottomless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crack sloped downward towards the Lostridge Mountains, cutting diagonally into the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Carey family had once ventured nearly two miles down but still hadn't seen the bottom. Just how deep it went was anyone's guess; it would take further exploration to find out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Mr. Dave Carey. Dark Exotic Beasts keep surfacing here. Defending just outside the fissure is a waste of time. I'm going in to check out the deepest parts of this crack. You should pull your people back to Eidolon City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's something down there even I can't handle, you'll want your people far away, and fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne left ten members of the Blood Demon Vanguard to handle perimeter defense, ensuring no one came too close. Then, accompanied by Anastasia, Zoe, and ninety Blood Demon Vanguard members, he descended into the fissure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered, Osborne felt the shift in the ambient energy around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The concentration of energy here is incredible," he muttered, his Satan's Eye already activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with his enhanced vision, he couldn't see the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thick fog seemed to cloak everything deeper down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a strong sense that there was a massive secret hidden in the depths of this fissure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confident in his abilities, he wasted no time, leading the group deeper.</span></p><div class="pagination">
