  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, perfect timing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner and Julian both bowed toward God of Light, then pointed at Jethro. "We're not arguing, but there's something we can't make sense of! Why isn't there a single Hudson family member on the list for today's border competition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro's been making excuses, claiming he submitted the list of Hudson family geniuses to you, and it's your fault for not choosing them! He even said he submitted a list of over 20,000 names. Ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are all these so-called geniuses from the Hudson family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, if Jethro really did submit the list, how come you didn't pick a single Hudson family member?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless... the Hudson family has already betrayed the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you're back, </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, please set the record straight and expose Jethro's lies. We need answers for the rest of us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not scared to send our geniuses to the border competition, but we won't tolerate having traitors in our ranks! If the Hudson family has turned their back on the Human Community, we sure don't want them mixed in with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian finished with a cold smirk, his eyes locked on Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner's expression was no different, his smile sharp and mocking. While he didn't necessarily believe the Hudson family had betrayed the Human Community, it was hard to ignore that a family of their stature&mdash;Dukedom-level power&mdash;having no representatives in such an important competition was a slap in the face to everyone else. It just didn't sit right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, waiting for her to tear Jethro's story to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others stood silent, expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Jethro, upon seeing </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, let out a sigh of relief. He also bowed respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, please, clear my Hudson family's name! We've sacrificed so much for the Human Community, and we always will. I won't let anyone slander us with accusations of betrayal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jethro shot Julian a venomous glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, </span><span>God of Light</span><span> finally spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see, so this is what it's about..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her gaze to Jethro. "Mr. Hudson did indeed submit a list of over 20,000 names to me&mdash;more than anyone else here," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in murmurs of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro really submitted a list of 20,000 names? He wasn't lying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Julian furrowed his brow and spoke up, "The number of names doesn't mean anything! Sure, Jethro might've submitted over 20,000 names, but they were probably all mediocre, right? Otherwise, how would </span><span>God of Light</span><span> have not chosen a single Hudson family member?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! The number doesn't matter! Only those with real talent&mdash;people who can challenge opponents above their level&mdash;are worthy of representing the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro's list must be full of ordinary Hudson family members who don't even qualify as geniuses. No wonder </span><span>God of Light</span><span> didn't pick any of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> cut through the chatter with a sharp command. "You don't need to make assumptions, and you certainly don't need to blame Mr. Hudson! Among the 20,000 names he submitted, many were genuine geniuses of the Human Community. That includes all of Mr. Hudson's sons, daughters, and grandchildren. Based on their abilities, any one of them could've made the list."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, the room went silent. Eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it really true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so, why hadn't </span><span>God of Light</span><span> included any Hudson family members on the list?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at her, confusion etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're probably wondering why I didn't include any Hudson family members on today's list, right? Well... I was just as surprised by the list Mr. Hudson submitted to me! As for why I was surprised, I'm not ready to share that with you just yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, letting the suspense build. "But you'll find out soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave them all a pointed look. "I can tell you this much. This border challenge isn't a one-day event. It'll go on until either the Human Community or the Dark Deity Legion decide they no longer want to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that Hudson's strong fighters aren't participating today doesn't mean they won't be in the future. The absence of Hudson family members on today's list is due to my own considerations. It has nothing to do with Mr. Hudson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I assure you... the Hudson family would never betray the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused again, letting the weight of her words sink in. "Lastly, let me make one thing perfectly clear... the list Mr. Hudson submitted has more names than any of your factions! It's not just the quantity; it's the quality...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Among them, Mr. Hudson himself will be participating in the Supernal Deity King Ascension Three competition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the room fell completely silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro straightened, his chest puffed out in pride. His gaze swept across the crowd, as though daring anyone to challenge him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still questioning me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still doubting the Hudson family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I submitted more geniuses than any of you, and I'm even stepping into the arena myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood tall, an air of superiority radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others felt a flush of embarrassment creeping up their necks, especially Tanner and Julian, whose faces twisted in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner paused, then gave a respectful bow. "Well, if </span><span>God of Light</span><span> says it's true, then I'll believe the Hudson family. I was too hasty before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Jethro. "Mr. Hudson, I sincerely apologize. I shouldn't have doubted your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro felt a wave of relief wash over him, and a smug sense of satisfaction bubbled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian snorted, clearly still unconvinced. He frowned and addressed </span><span>God of Light</span><span> again. "</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, I still don't get it! You say you were shocked by the list Hudson submitted&mdash;so why didn't you include any Hudson family members in today's competition? What's really going on here? Why can't you just tell us now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around, as if searching for confirmation. "I'm sure many of us are as curious as I am, and I think it's best to clear the air now, so we don't end up second-guessing each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> narrowed her eyes slightly, her patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian felt a chill at her tone, but he stubbornly pressed on, bowing slightly as he spoke, "I really do want to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave him a sharp look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph. Fine. If you want to know, then I'll tell you. The list Mr. Hudson submitted contains over 20,000 names: 10,000 geniuses at the peak of the Deity Overlord level, 10,000 at the highest Deity King level, 100 at the Ascension One Supernal Deity King level, and one at the Ascension Three Supernal Deity King level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as </span><span>God of Light</span><span> finished speaking, the room fell into an eerie silence. It felt as though time itself had stopped. Everyone stood frozen, mouths agape, staring at Jethro in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Tanner and Julian jumped to their feet, eyes wide with shock, unable to process what they'd just heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, </span><span>God of Light</span><span>'s words echoed over and over again, each one sinking in deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The list Hudson had submitted...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand at the peak of Deity Overlord level? Ten thousand at the highest Deity King level? And 100 at Ascension One Supernal Deity King, plus one at Ascension Three Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How is that even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having 10,000 at the peak of Deity Overlord wasn't exactly mind-blowing. The various Dukedom-level powers here could easily boast over 10,000 in that range&mdash;though most of them were far from "genius" material. They were just ordinary cultivators who had run out of potential, stuck at the same level after years of training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But 10,000 at the highest Deity King level...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell was going on here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hudson's family was ranked near the bottom among Dukedom-level powers. How could they possibly have more than 10,000 at the highest Deity King level?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this some kind of joke?</span></p><div class="pagination">
