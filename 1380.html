  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the most powerful </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, those at the Deity Overlord or Deity King level, were known for their low intelligence. What chance did this Class S </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sensed Osborne's presence and charged at him with wild abandon, driven by an instinctual hunger for blood and flesh, completely indifferent to its opponent's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar that echoed through the cavern, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> closed in, unleashing a shockwave of Psychic Blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force was intense enough to rattle even the strongest Class S beings, sending tremors through their very souls. But Osborne's spirit was resilient, fortified by his countless battles. This mental assault had no effect on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Deathborn</span><span> can shift between a spiritual and a physical form. If it's in a spiritual state, it can only attack mentally. Since its psychic attack is ineffective, it must be switching to its physical form now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he predicted, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> abruptly halted. Its ethereal body began to solidify, coalescing like molten rock cooling into a hard shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entity boasted sharp claws, pointed fangs, blood-red hair, and skin of a similar hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It bore an unsettling resemblance to Osborne's form when he once transformed into a Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked in surprise. "Is this what a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> looks like?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I didn't know better, I'd think it was a member of the Blood Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thought struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> resembles the Blood Clan so closely, could there be a real connection between them? I wonder if my heritage as the Blood Clan's progenitor has any influence over it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne dropped the Eclipsing Mantra, revealing his true essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, which had been charging at him with reckless abandon, skidded to a halt. Confusion, shock, and even fear flickered in its blood-red eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its body trembled as it began to retreat slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared, astonished. "Is this creature actually afraid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and his sister always said the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> were too primitive to know fear. Otherwise, they wouldn't have dared to attack Lord Malevolence back in the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one has ever seen a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> exhibit fear before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here it was, this </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> before him, clearly shaken by Osborne's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> truly has a connection with the Blood Clan?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, when he sensed my aura as the progenitor of the Blood Clan, he was afraid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this fear is not as intense as the dread and submission that the Blood Clan experiences upon encountering me! This indicates that </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> is not actually a Blood Clan member but merely related to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, dealing with </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> should be far easier for me than for others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne moved forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, now gripped by panic, was in full retreat. In its current state, it could barely muster a fraction of its strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It swung its claws at Osborne, but its hands shook uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this chaotic state, it stood no chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly closed the gap, overpowering the creature with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seized the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> by the throat, applying just enough pressure to render it completely immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My aura can strike fear into the hearts of </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, throw them into disarray, and render them incapable of fighting at full capacity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only that, but my power actively suppresses them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This means I could become a veritable nemesis to the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. Even a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> ten times stronger than me would likely think twice before attacking. They'd see me and run for the hills!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thrill of this newfound revelation sent a rush of adrenaline through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected advantage reshaped Osborne's situation in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, making it significantly safer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most humans under the oppressive thumb of the Dark Deity Legion chose to remain chained rather than risk outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why? Because outside lurked far too many </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wilds were a death sentence; anyone who ventured too far would find themselves quickly surrounded, torn apart, and devoured, no matter how strong they thought they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne? He could simply use his presence to scare the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this light, the wild </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> posed little threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, not unless he encountered one that far surpassed his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what's the actual connection between </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> and the Blood Clan? The Blood Clan exists because of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! Only those who merge with it can truly claim to be the true ancestor of the Blood Clan. So, could these </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> somehow be tied to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thought struck Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightened his grip on the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> until it broke under the strain. The creature was annihilated instantly, leaving behind a swirling cloud of blood-red essence known as the scent of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This aura was far more potent than any ordinary scent of death. To anyone encountering it, the overwhelming stench was practically repulsive, and it could corrode a Divine Body in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something unexpected occurred: Osborne felt the nearly dormant Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within him shudder to life.</span></p><div class="pagination">
