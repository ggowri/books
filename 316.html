  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You want to set sail personally? No way! Absolutely not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too dangerous to go out to sea now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian jumped out of his seat, shaking his head furiously as he rejected Osborne's proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, Osborne told Brian that he wanted to set sail to personally investigate who was targeting their cruise line and uncover the identity of the mastermind behind the attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian refused without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply too dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't the first to consider this approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many senior members of the Augustine family had already tried similar investigations, </span><span>including the previous family head, Allen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The results had been disastrous. No matter how well prepared they were or how many skilled protectors they had, the enemy always outmatched them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian didn't want Osborne to take risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was the heir, the hope of the Augustine family. If Osborne got into trouble at sea, Brian couldn't imagine how they would overcome the current crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Brian, of course I know it is very dangerous to set sail now, but I must go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is called luring the snake out of its hole!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face was grim. "Luring the snake out of its hole doesn't require the heir to risk his life. Any senior member the Augustine family can achieve the same effect. You know the outcome as well as I do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our family head, Allen, was killed by the mastermind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brian, I know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression remained calm. "But I have to do this. If I want to solve the current predicament, we need to restore the cruise route and capture the mastermind behind the attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggested this because I am confident. Even if I can't catch the mastermind, I am confident I can return safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. "Brian, you must trust me now and cooperate with me! I won't gamble with my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian fell into deep contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not give him time to decide and continued, "The news that I became the heir of the Augustine family has spread throughout Dampston. The mastermind targeting the Augustine family must be aware of it. They must also know about I defeated Nathan, Ryan and the other two alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this situation, don't you think the mastermind would really want to eliminate me? They won't let me live."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression changed. "Impossible! Only the direct members of our Augustine family know about your fight with Nathan and the other three. How could outsiders know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, said nothing, and just stared into Brian's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's expression changed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, do you mean that there is a traitor among our direct family members?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Brian, I think you've suspected this for a while but didn't want to believe it. But this is the fact. There must be a traitor among our direct family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, Allen and other senior members would not have died so easily at sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's face was extremely gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed. Brian had many good qualities but was too indecisive and cautious. He wouldn't make big mistakes, but he also wouldn't accomplish great things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Brian, only by personally taking this risk can I lure the mastermind </span><span>out and eliminate them. I will take Nathan, Kaden, Ryan, and Queenie with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Absolutely not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian took a breath and said, "Absolutely not! You are the leaders of the younger generation. If something happens to you, the Augustine family is doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I agree to let you go to sea, but you can't take them all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, if you ask to break down a wall, people will oppose it, but if you suggest tearing down the whole house, they will agree to the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting on a troubled expression, Osborne said, "Alright! Then I'll only take Nathan and Ryan. Brian, only with tempting enough bait will the cunning prey take the hook!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to take Nathan because he was the most obedient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took Ryan because his suspicion of him hadn't disappeared. He wanted to observe him closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was indeed a traitor, he would reveal himself, and then Osborne could deal with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian clenched his teeth, showing intense struggle on his face, but finally, he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! Just the three of you. I'll make arrangements!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can set sail the day after tomorrow at the earliest. I will arrange for two Class A members of The Wise Order to secretly protect you, ensuring your safety as much as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! That's settled then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having achieved his goal, Osborne left to prepare for the voyage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't rely solely on the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had strong allies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had already arrived in Pinchide City with Anastasia and Zoe and had settled in.</span></p><div class="pagination">
