  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ten years?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists, his face resolute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At the current rate of the Elven Mother Tree's essence depletion, it will completely vanish in ten years, and the Elven Mother Tree will wither entirely!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, Alfreda will also die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you bring her back to life, her consciousness won't recover, and she will die immediately! So, you'd better hurry and find the Fountain of Life within ten years."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Primordial finished speaking, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten years is actually very short for people at their cultivation level. A single retreat for them could easily exceed ten years, or even a hundred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But anyway, compared to Alfreda dying immediately, a ten-year buffer is already good enough, because at least there's still some hope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked, "What if I use time powers to slow down the flow of time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shook his head. "That won't work!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit regretful. If time powers worked, he could have easily turned Alfreda's ten years into a hundred or even a thousand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, that doesn't work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Alfreda and said, "Alfreda, don't worry, I will definitely save the Elven Mother Tree and you! Within ten years, I will venture deeper into the universe to find the Fountain of Life, no matter how difficult it is!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was incredibly serious and solemn, as if making a vow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I believe in you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, since the essence of the Elven Mother Tree was no longer rapidly depleting, Alfreda looked much better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne removed the surrounding defense shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Alfreda's parents and brother rushed in. Seeing her alive again, they burst into tears of joy and surrounded her with concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To ease their worries, she made up a kind lie, explaining that her condition had been stabilized by Osborne and that she only needed to rest by his side for ten years to fully recover.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others did not expose her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah grabbed Osborne's shoulder, showing immense excitement and gratitude. "From now on, Alfreda is in your hands! She is our only daughter. Please, no matter what, you must take good care of her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uriah, don't worry. Even if I have to risk my life, I won't let Alfreda be bullied again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne transferred Alfreda to Drum's Dimensional Microcosm, an absolutely safe place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, it was a Dimensional Microcosm created on the Drum of Empress Kira. Unless the Drum of Empress Kira is destroyed, this Dimensional Microcosm cannot be destroyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this cosmos, almost no creature can destroy the Drum of Empress Kira, made from her bones and skin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda will be absolutely safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, there's an earth-shattering secret: Empress Kira's consciousness is still alive here!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, you must take good care of Alfreda, got it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued, "Also, keep powering the Domain Suppression Stele, absolutely no mistakes allowed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, don't worry. With me, Alfreda and the Domain Suppression Stele will be absolutely fine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was completely relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Drum taking care of and protecting Alfreda, he truly had nothing to worry about.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne and Alfreda looked at each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was still very weak, barely able to sit up in bed. Looking at the surroundings, she felt a bit uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Alfreda, just rest here at ease. If you feel bored, ask Drum to keep you company! If I have time, I'll come in to accompany you often. Also, I'll frequently have Isa and Clarissa come in to chat with you, so you won't feel bored."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda immediately nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda smiled and said, "You don't have to come see me all the time! Having Drum with me is good enough. Besides, Flash is here too! You all be careful out there and stay safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and patted her head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he still felt uneasy. She had just been resurrected, yet her condition immediately worsened, and she had to stay alone in Drum's Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He vowed in his heart once again, "No matter what, I must cure Alfreda as soon as possible so she can live a normal life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After spending some time with Alfreda in the Dimensional Microcosm, Osborne held back his sadness and turned to leave, knowing that a brief companionship was meaningless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he stayed here with her every day, he could only accompany her for ten years, all while watching her grow weaker and closer to death day by day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he wanted was not ten years of companionship, but much longer!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he had to leave here to improve his strength, solve the problem, and find a way to obtain the Fountain of Life!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether he needed to venture deeper into the universe or face more trials of the Celestial Spire to exchange for it, he had to find it within ten years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne returned to Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked, "Uriah, Hilaria, without the Elven Mother Tree, Elf City is no longer safe! Will you stay here or leave with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah hesitated for a moment, then shook his head and said, "Even without the Elven Mother Tree, this is still Elf City, the place we know best and our home. We want to stay here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and didn't try to persuade further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out a Dimensional Bag, handed it to Uriah, and said, "Uriah, there are some items inside that can enhance your strength and keep you safer! I have some very important matters to handle, so I won't stay here any longer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take care of yourselves! As for Alfreda, rest assured and leave her to me. I will take good care of her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah did not refuse and took the Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's strength at this point was beyond Uriah and Hilaria's understanding, and their only daughter was also with him. Since he was giving them something, they simply accepted it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All of you, be careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne left, Uriah opened the Dimensional Bag and was stunned. The various high-level Sacred Artifacts and resources for boosting cultivation levels inside left him wide-eyed in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With these, their family could easily reach a cultivation level they never even dared to dream of before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already taken Isa, Clarissa, and Kendra aboard the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had been an entire day since he arrived in Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spent quite a bit of time mainly settling Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! It's time to head back! I've calculated the time. Emperor Frederick is about to discover the secret base of the Fairy Moon Sect. We need to return and prepare for the big battle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze turned icy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Once I deal with Emperor Frederick, avenge my past life's grudge, and uncover the secrets about my mother, I might have to venture deeper into the universe to find the Fountain of Life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emperor Frederick, this time, let&rsquo;s end the hatred once and for all! Mother, watch me. I&rsquo;ll soon kill Emperor Frederick and avenge you!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone who humiliated and tormented us will pay the price!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
