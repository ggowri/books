  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a command from Algernon, the thirty-member team set out from their camp, heading straight for Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the distance, two pairs of cold, hostile eyes followed their movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Calvin, Osborne is as good as dead now, so you can finally breathe easy, right? I've used my connections to secure you a spot on the exploration team heading out tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your divine power essence was destroyed, and only the Miracle Elixir from Divine Peak Nine could potentially heal you. I promised to assemble a team to help you reach Divine Peak Nine and find that elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The team tomorrow will have a Deity King warrior leading it, making it much safer for you and greatly increasing your chances of getting the Miracle Elixir. I'd say that's a promise fulfilled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Athena glanced at Calvin, gauging his reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin nodded appreciatively. "Athena, thank you for everything. Regardless of how things turn out, if I ever get the chance to heal, I won't forget your kindness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A faint smile crept onto Athena's face. "If luck is on your side and you manage to get the Miracle Elixir to heal your injuries, just remember to save a little for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's get moving. We need to prepare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin nodded and shot one last hateful glance in the direction where Osborne had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, if I manage to recover, I hope you don't die too soon. I want to kill you myself and see you beg for mercy right before your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, the weight of his animosity heavy in the air, Calvin turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne and Diana lagged at the back of the group, easily over a hundred yards from the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't seem bothered by the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had initially thought the exploration team would consist of just the two of them, but now, with twenty-eight others joining the expedition, they felt more secure. With more people on the front lines to scout ahead and share some of the risks, both were pleased with the change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like our destination is around here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Along the path, Diana pulled out a map of Divine Peak Nine. The majority of the map showed nothing but a ghostly haze, indicating untouched territory, while the explored areas only skimmed the outer perimeter&mdash;at most tens of thousands of miles deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana pointed to a spot deep within Divine Peak Nine, some sixty thousand miles in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is where someone accidentally discovered the Celestial Crystal last time. Afterward, the Deity King warrior assembled a team to take us here for mining. However, we faced countless dangers along the way. If it weren't for the Deity King's immense strength, we wouldn't have made it through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the end, we were only three thousand miles from our destination when we got surrounded by a horde of Deathborn. Only I and the Deity King managed to make it back alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her finger traced a bloody red dot on the map, and a shiver of fear crossed her features as she recalled the traumatic experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Memories of that expedition still haunted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne noticed the myriad red dots scattered across the map and asked, "Diana, what are all these red dots?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those are Deathborn nests," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Deathborn nests?" Osborne's surprise was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew well that these nests were hotspots for Deathborn activity, essentially serving as villages, towns, or cities for those ruthless creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied, her tone serious as she studied the map, "Yep, those are Deathborn nests!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"According to the color and size of these red dots, the Deathborn nests vary in scale. The lightest colors indicate village-level nests, housing at least a thousand Deathborns. Next up are town-level nests, which contain no less than 10 thousand. Then we have city-level nests, swarming with over 100 thousand Deathborns!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally, there are the national-level nests, which we can call Deathborn strongholds with populations exceeding one million. These are incredibly formidable! Typically, a national-level Deathborn nest will host at least one Deity King-level Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Our exploration of Divine Peak Nine is only just beginning&mdash;we haven't even touched one-tenth of it&mdash;but we've already identified three national-level nests! On top of that, there are dozens of city-level nests and thousands of both town and village nests!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why the map is so cluttered with red dots. To navigate Divine Peak Nine safely, our first priority must be to steer clear of these Deathborn nests. If we can avoid detection by the Deathborn, our chances of survival improve significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Last time, we ran into a national-level Deathborn nest. In those nests, there's usually an army of over ten thousand Deathborns. Even a Deity King warrior would struggle to survive against such numbers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Diana finished, Osborne felt a frown etching deeper on his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you saying there's a national-level Deathborn nest near our destination, the Celestial Crystal mine? So, to reach our target, we need to skirt around this major nest? But if we do that, we'll have to traverse through a vast area that hasn't been fully explored, increasing the risk of stumbling into other Deathborn nests?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded gravely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's the situation we're in. To safely reach the Celestial Crystal mine, we need both strength and a bit of luck on our side."</span></p><div class="pagination">
