  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne also looked over in surprise and saw a large group of people approaching aggressively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were a total of sixty people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were the contestants from the branch bloodlines of Yalynch, Marcelin, and Ransford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had no intention of restraining themselves. Each of them had a look of pride on their face, looking at everyone arrogantly with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone could see the contempt and disdain in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their looks made everyone unhappy, but no one said anything because they did have the right to be proud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the Branch Bloodline Competition five years ago, the three branch bloodlines from Yalynch, Marcelin, and Ransford easily won the top three places.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the branch bloodline from Norlend, which was ranked fourth, had a huge gap with them. Even if it tried their best, it was difficult to cause trouble to these three branch bloodlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Five years later, these three branch bloodlines had become even stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked at the three leading people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were Lance, Sam, and David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance was about thirty-two or thirty-three years old. He was tall, with a calm and indifferent expression. He didn't look like a Rosmandian, but rather a mixed-race.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the heir of the Augustine family branch bloodline of Yalynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was also recognized as the strongest among the nine heirs of the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Three years ago, he had already broken through to Class AA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance's strength was unfathomable and far beyond the reach of Henry, John, and others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people compared him with the main bloodline's heirs Owen and Emma, thinking that Lance would win first place in the Branch Bloodline Competition and become the fifth future heir to the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is a powerful opponent!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne made a judgment in his mind. Lance had been Class AA three years ago, and his strength was almost as good as Owen's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked at Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam was the heir of the branch bloodline in Marcelin. He was about the same age as Lance and a mixed-race, but he was taller, like an upright grizzly bear, and his sturdy body pressured people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Rodney was shorter than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is also a powerful opponent!" Osborne murmured in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam was also Class AA, and he was one of the few members of the Augustine family who didn't practice Satan's Eye but focused on martial arts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was born with great powers, and his strength was more terrifying than those of people at the same level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wonder if his power is stronger, or mine?" Osborne felt a little excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Osborne was only Class A+, his body had mutated, and he integrated his soul of powers and absorbed the star power, so his strength was much stronger than those at the same level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People at the same level couldn't even withstand a punch from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked forward to fighting with Sam to see who was stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, he looked at David, the heir of the branch bloodline in Ransford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For some reason, when Osborne saw David, he felt a strong disgust in his heart. David looked very short, only as tall as Sam's chest, and his body was very thin and weak, with fierce eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But these were not the reasons why Osborne disliked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even he himself didn't know why he disliked David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Osborne didn't underestimate David because Godfather once told him three things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"First, never let your enemy know all your cards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Second, never hate your enemies, because that will affect your judgment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Third, great people are not born great, but they become great in the process of growing up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wouldn't look down on David just because he hated him. On the contrary, Osborne knew that David was very strong and was even more dangerous than Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I should be careful of this person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After making a judgment in his heart, Osborne withdrew his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne turned his head, his expression became solemn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "The branch bloodlines of Yalynch, Marcelin, and Ransford came here together. They seem to have a very close relationship and may have formed an alliance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that's the case, things will be a bit troublesome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only two people in this Branch Bloodline Competition will become the future heirs of the Augustine family. If the three strongest branch bloodlines join forces, the chances of the others, including me, will be very slim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With their strength, they can easily kick away all the people from the other five major branch bloodlines."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned tightly, thinking of a solution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were nine branch bloodlines, with a total of only 123 people participating in the competition. Sixty of them were from Yalynch, Marcelin, and Ransford, which was almost half.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their overall strength was even stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under such circumstances, how could others compete for the position of becoming the future heir to the Augustine family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was difficult to defeat them head-on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this time, both Osborne and the people from the other five branch bloodlines had ugly faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one expected that the three most powerful branch bloodlines would come together as if they had joined forces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They are trying to intimidate us." Osborne snorted coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "No matter what, I must get a chance to become the future heir of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I will kill anyone who dares to stop me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne closed his eyes and waited for departure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this time, all the contestants had arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a loud shout sounded.</p><div class="pagination">
