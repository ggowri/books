  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What happened?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in the center of the icy region, Gerald and the others were treating their injuries and restoring Sacred Power when they suddenly felt an extremely intense battle fluctuation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked into the distance, frowning tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As an Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection super warrior, Gerald possessed incredibly powerful perception. If he wished, he could sense movements across half of the Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he sensed an incredibly powerful force surging within the volcanic region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's the direction where the Magma Devourer fled!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it fighting? With whom? I can feel its anger! What's happening over there?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald felt very puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the surviving judges </span><span>were</span><span> nearby. Who else on Abyssal Planet could engage in such a fierce battle with the Magma Devourer and enrage it to this extent?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the contestants' teams </span><span>we</span><span>re not far from us, with around eight or nine hundred people. Even if there </span><span>were</span><span> some scattered contestants outside the teams, with their strength, they couldn't withstand a single move from the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Norton, what happened? There seems to be battle activity in the volcanic area."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald nodded, frowned deeply, and asked, "Could there be another Native Creature as powerful as the Magma Devourer on Abyssal Planet? Did it take advantage of us injuring the Magma Devourer to attack it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he felt excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps this is our chance to kill the Magma Devourer! Everyone, follow me. Let's go take a look!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Gerald and the others quickly approached the volcanic area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in the heart of the volcanic region, thick volcanic ash, like dark clouds, shrouded the world. All the surrounding volcanoes were erupting violently. Scorching lava covered the ground, forming a sea of molten rock, steaming with heat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In mid-air, the massive Magma Devourer angrily swatted Flash away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash is injured!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He fought fiercely against the Magma Devourer alone for ten minutes. Only now did he show signs of being at a disadvantage. He was already incredibly strong, managing to leave it covered in wounds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a Silicon-based Lifeform. Such injuries mean nothing to it, not even minor wounds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It spewed magma particles at Flash, instantly engulfing him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he rushed out, he was more severely injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His six pairs of wings were injured to varying degrees, significantly reducing his speed and agility. If he continued fighting, he would undoubtedly lose, or even die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Osborne a bit anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, be careful! You've done enough. Leave the rest to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne squinted his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial had already calculated the weaknesses of the Magma Devourer. Those most critical silicon-based neural nodes were located in its chest and near its head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne did not launch an attack immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was also calculating the chances of destroying those silicon-based neural nodes and the likelihood of killing the Magma Devourer if he took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Although those silicon-based neural nodes are on the surface of the Magma Devourer's body, its body is too massive. The so-called surface is actually several dozen yards deep!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I must cut a wound several dozen yards deep into the Magma Devourer's body to have a chance to destroy those silicon-based neural nodes and defeat it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that's too hard!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Flash's claws and teeth can only cause wounds at most dozens of feet deep on the Magma Devourer, no more than 33 feet! Even with the sharp Warfare Scythe, it would be incredibly difficult for me to create a wound several dozen yards deep, right?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And I only have one chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression was extremely serious, but he knew he couldn't waste any more time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If things continue like this, Flash will be defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Flash holding back the Magma Devourer and drawing its attention, Osborne's actions would be riskier and even less effective.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Forget it. I'll give it my all and try!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I fail, I'll immediately take Flash and escape from here. Even though the Magma Devourer is full of treasures, I don't have the strength to deal with it, so I can only give up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne made up his mind, he took the Warfare Scythe from the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Scythe, fused with the Necrosnake's fangs, had transformed into a massive scythe over six feet long. Its entire body was jet black, with both blades gleaming sharply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If someone took one look at it, their eyes would feel as if they were about to be slashed blind. After all, this scythe was incredibly menacing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the Warfare Scythe, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whether I succeed or not depends on how truly sharp you are."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne fixed his gaze on the distant Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Intense waves of power began surging from his body. He had only one chance, so he had to give it his all and gather enough strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he was merely an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, not yet reaching Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Gerald, who had reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, couldn&rsquo;t severely injure the Magma Devourer with his full-force attack. He could only succeed after its power was suppressed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's cultivation level was far inferior to Gerald's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with the sharp Warfare Scythe, Osborne wasn&rsquo;t confident he could severely wound the Magma Devourer with one strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was serious as he mobilized every ounce of strength in his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy saw Osborne's actions and immediately became extremely worried about him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought he had truly gone mad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is Osborne really planning to take on the Magma Devourer himself? But what's the point? He's not even an Empyrean Sacredness. Even if he goes all out, his attacks won't cause any harm to the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And even a casual counterattack from it could cost him his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't be impulsive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy wanted to step forward to stop Osborne from throwing his life away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he just waved his hand at them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't say anything yet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said seriously, "I'll just give it a try! Just one strike. If I can't kill the Magma Devourer, I'll immediately take Flash and you all away, and we won't provoke the Magma Devourer again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Step back a bit. This attack will be powerful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face was solemn as he stared at the Warfare Scythe in his hand, pouring all his Sacred Power into it frantically and compressing it repeatedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pitch-black Warfare Scythe began to tremble violently, emitting a glow like black flames. The sheer power left Clara and Leroy utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they didn't believe this could change anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the terrifying power of the Magma Devourer, this was still not enough! They still felt Osborne was courting death, doing something utterly meaningless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he had said he would only try one strike, and if he failed, he would retreat immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy hesitated for a moment but ultimately didn't stop Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They just watched him with immense worry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already focused all his attention on the chest of the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Flash drew the Magma Devourer's attention, Osborne moved!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This strike of mine can cut through everything!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
