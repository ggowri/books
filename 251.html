  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We also need to test the power of the level five Devil's Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was full of expectations for the Devil's Light of level five. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Augustine family had been passed down for thousands of years, and there were at least hundreds of metahuman who had opened Satan's Eye, but no one had ever been able to fuse the level five Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one person who had succeeded in integrating even the level four Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that person exploded and died before he had the chance to test the power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, no one knew how powerful the Devil's Light above level four was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne would be the first one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a shower, cleaned off the blood on his body, looked at himself in the mirror, and felt that his temperament seemed to have changed a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to have grown a little taller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a great figure. Every muscle of him looked great and seemed to be very powerful. He had eight abdominal muscles, and her bronze skin made him look impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne himself was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that if he were a woman, he would be attractive to such a figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with his handsome features and cold temperament, Osborne felt like he was a completely different person compared to a month ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smile, he walked out of the room confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the room, Zoe had been waiting for a long time. After all, they must have heard Osborne's screams before. If Isa hadn't stopped her, she would have rushed into the room long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Osborne coming out, she hurried over and grabbed Osborne's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine." Osborne smiled slightly and looked at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was staring at Osborne blankly at this moment. She stared at his face and figure in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How come you look like a different person? Your appearance hasn't changed much, but you seem to be calmer, more confident, and more handsome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa finished speaking, she was amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked up to Osborne and pinched his arm carelessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you seem to have grown taller! And your skin is so resilient. Have you made a breakthrough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne slapped away Isa's hands that kept pinching him, and said unhappily, "Why are you touching me? What's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your honor that I am willing to touch you. Are you shy? Last time you forcefully kissed me, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly stepped forward and covered Isa's mouth. He glanced at Zoe and said unhappily, "Don't talk nonsense! A child is here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not a child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe stuck out her tongue and noticed the changes in Osborne's body. She immediately stared at him closely with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa pushed Osborne away and said unhappily, "What happened? I heard your screams earlier and felt a very strong energy fluctuation. It seemed like there was something wrong. I didn't want to disturb you, so I didn't go to check it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of fear appeared on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was just that something unexpected happened during training, but I'm fine now. And because of this, my strength has greatly increased."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne looked at Isa with a smile and seemed to be aggressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think I can beat you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa also smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She jokingly said, "Are you sure? Are you so confident? It seems that you have improved a lot. Do you want to give it a try? How about the loser agrees to a condition from the other party?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked excited when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I propose any conditions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said calmly, "As long as you win, even if you ask me to sleep with you, I will agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel Isa's confidence, and he also knew that Isa was very strong, like an unfathomable abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was equally confident now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before today, he was able to defeat Class B+ metahumans like Orion and Derek, and now, his strength had greatly improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level of extra energy was raised from Class C+ to Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Devil's Light of level three had also broken through to the fifth level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Class C+ physical fitness leaped to Class B+, and he even possessed the self-healing ability, which only Class A+ or even gods could possess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that Osborne's strength had undergone a tremendous change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he met Orion or Derek again, or even was besieged by them, he would be killed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was even confident that he could defeat a Class A master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't believe that he couldn't beat Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was so young. No matter how capable she was, could she be more capable than him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't believe it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll make a bet with you! Whoever loses has to agree to one condition from the </span><span>other party. Any condition is fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled and waved her hand to let Zoe step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to sleep with me? Then use all your strength and defeat me first!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
