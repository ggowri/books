  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no idea that he carried a strong Demon Dragon's Breath. Anyone who reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness could clearly sense it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was quickly searching for the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "It seems there are no Illusionary Heavenly Demons here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He found it strange and thought, "Do Illusionary Heavenly Demons only exist in those independent illusionary spaces? Then why, even after the independent illusionary spaces shattered, can we still not leave the Phantomagic Realm and have to stay here for another half month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it. Whatever. I'll just find them first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had Satan's Eye. He believed that as long as the members of the Frenetic Storm Warband were still alive, he could definitely find them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he saw a group of people appearing in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their strength was not weak, led by three advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors. Among the many forces that entered the Phantomagic Realm, their power was considered above average.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "According to Blossom Cage's intel, this time, there are hundreds of thousands of people entering the Phantomagic Realm, all with cultivation levels above Empyrean Sacredness! Among them, there are over twenty Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors, hundreds of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors, and thousands of advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He recalled the conversation between Dalia and Romina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Blossom Cage's plot is to use ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns to capture everyone who enters the Phantomagic Realm in one fell swoop! When will Blossom Cage take action?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although I am prepared, I am not necessarily safe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, I must find the Frenetic Storm Warband before Blossom Cage takes action, control them, and ensure they don't fall victim to Blossom Cage's plot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne became even more anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t plan to take a detour and was ready to pass by those people. They were just three advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors, posing no threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne unexpectedly noticed that they were staring at him eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could react, they moved quickly, blocking him and surrounding him in a triangle formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the other mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors and primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors also surrounded Osborne from the outer circle. Each of them was excited, gripping their weapons, and casting malicious, greedy gazes at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t panic. He simply asked the leader calmly, &ldquo;What do you mean by this? Do we have a grudge? Is there something you need from me?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged leader immediately let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;This is our first meeting, so of course, we have no grudge! However, we are very interested in your Dragon Elixir! If you hand it over obediently, we can spare your life! Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll have to take it by force.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;You want to take my Dragon Elixir? I&rsquo;m just alone. I didn&rsquo;t get much Dragon Elixir.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just wants to quickly find the Frenetic Storm Warband and avoid trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after he finished speaking, that person burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey, stop playing dumb! We can already sense the strong Demon Dragon's Breath on you! So, you definitely have a lot of Dragon Elixir on you! You might even have the Legendary Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was even more surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I have strong Demon Dragon's Breath on me? They can sense that I have Legendary Dragon Elixir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've sealed all the Dragon Elixir in the jadeflare vial, there shouldn't be any aura leaking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he also sensed the Demon Dragon's Breath on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he understood everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Although I sealed all the Dragon Elixir in the jadeflare vial without leaking its aura, I had been exposed to too much Demon Dragon's Breath before, so there's still a strong residue on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone with strong perception can notice it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this dim Phantomagic Realm, the dense Demon Dragon's Breath on me might be like a beacon! Anyone who senses it can guess that I possess a large amount of Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such an aura won't dissipate in a short time. If he carefully senses, he can also detect Demon Dragon's Breath on others, just like this group of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader carries a significant amount of Demon Dragon's Breath. Osborne guessed he likely possesses a considerable number of Mid-grade Dragon Elixirs, maybe even Top-grade Dragon Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your expression has already betrayed you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We guessed right, didn't we? You really have a large amount of Dragon Elixir! So, hand it over obediently! There's still half a month before this Phantomagic Realm disappears. This is the time for mutual plundering!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't want to die, obey my orders! Otherwise, we'll have no choice but to send you to hell!" the leader said with a cold sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh and said calmly, "Yes! I do have a large amount of Dragon Elixirs, even Legendary Dragon Elixirs, but I won't give them to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man was instantly overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that so? Then we'll take it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come on! Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the group made their move. Three advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors targeted Osborne's vital points, launching a powerful attack without any mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you want to kill me, then you can die too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash instantly became excited. He let out a deep dragon roar, then unleashed Dragon's Breath, engulfing the enemies in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, piercing screams echoed. Flash spewed silver Dragon's Breath, effortlessly melting their defenses and bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their bodies, like snow meeting the blazing sun, stood no chance of resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, a team of dozens vanished completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors were no match for Flash at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, collecting the Dimensional Bags left behind by the dead. In the Dimensional Bag of the leader, he found two jadeflare vials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the jadeflare vials contained over a hundred drops of Low-grade Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other jadeflare vial contained over thirty drops of Mid-grade Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Low-grade Dragon Elixir and Mid-grade Dragon Elixir no longer have any effect on me! But outside, they are considered valuable resources and can fetch a good price. This is quite a decent gain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, these people's Dimensional Bags contain quite a lot of Sacred Crystals, various resources, and materials! This can be considered a small fortune!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne put away the items and continued forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, knowing that the strong Demon Dragon's Breath on him would attract other forces to fight for it, he naturally wouldn't charge ahead recklessly anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When his Satan's Eye spotted people from afar, he would immediately avoid them, avoiding any conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His goal remained only one, and that was the Frenetic Storm Warband!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, Osborne and Flash searched the Phantomagic Realm at incredible speed. In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And on this day, Osborne finally found his target, the Frenetic Storm Warband!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, seeing the situation of the Frenetic Storm Warband, he couldn't help but frown.</span></p><div class="pagination">
