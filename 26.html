  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s contemptuous voice angered Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His face instantly darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He clenched his fists, stood up abruptly, and glared at Osborne. &ldquo;What did you say, bastard?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled and sat calmly. &ldquo;Are you out of money? You dare not compete with me in wealth, so you want to hit me, huh?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Fight me. Life is the stake.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at Wesley provocatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon hearing Osborne&rsquo;s words, Wesley suddenly felt like a splash of water was poured on his head, and he quickly calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he saw the security guards of Draco Auction House staring at him with a cold face, he felt a chill on his back and hurriedly sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley held back his fury and said, &ldquo;You pissed me off, bastard. It&rsquo;s just two million dollars. To me, it is not even pocket money. Today, I will let you know the gap between us.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Wesley raised the bidding paddle again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said loudly, &ldquo;I want this painting. Five million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The crowd exclaimed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a charity auction, not a treasure auction. Using five million dollars to auction a worthless painting was an unwise choice. Wesley was obviously in a fit of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if he was the heir of the Ashford family, it was abnormal that he made such a high bid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But something even more abnormal happened right after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment Wesley finished speaking, Osborne raised his bidding paddle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sneered, &ldquo;You want it? Huh, who do you think you are? Have you asked about my bid? Six million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was dumbfounded. No one had expected that Osborne, an ordinary person who was lucky enough to sneak in with a VIP experience card, would actually spend six million dollars for charity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Judging from his calm expression, Osborne didn&rsquo;t look hesitant at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Some people whispered, &ldquo;Could it be that the previous news was false?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is Osborne not an ordinary person but a big shot hiding his identity?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They thought about it, but soon, they denied this possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Fuck you!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was utterly enraged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t understand why Osborne dared to bid six million dollars. It was a waste of money to spend six million dollars on that useless painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even he was reluctant to make that bid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne looked calm, as if he didn&rsquo;t care about the money at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only the Caldwell family knew why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In their opinion, Osborne dared to bid so high and did not care about the money just because his money was extorted from the Caldwell family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He would naturally be reckless with the money that he got from others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia glared at Osborne and whispered, &ldquo;Are you crazy? Stop bidding right now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled and said loudly, &ldquo;What do you mean? I&rsquo;m contributing to charity and providing funds for orphans, but you asked me to stop bidding. And you said I was crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Do you think we shouldn&rsquo;t do charity, right? You don&rsquo;t support charity. Or do you think only crazy people would do charity?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne finished speaking with contempt. Ophelia was flushed in a fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If the media reported what Osborne said, she would be scolded by ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What was worse was that the Caldwell Group would be boycotted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">People had the right to do charity or not, but they couldn&rsquo;t slander it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia explained, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant. I support charity. I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Enough. Shut up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne interrupted her and said calmly, &ldquo;It is no use talking without doing. Since you support charity, then show your sincerity and bid for two lots.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was dumbfounded. She stared at Osborne in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt that she had fallen into Osborne&rsquo;s trap and was fooled by his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She could imagine that if she refused to buy the two items, she would be accused by the media of not supporting charity and preventing others from doing charity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more exasperating thing was that Osborne dared to let her shut up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, Osborne had never dared speak to her like this. Ophelia was burning with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in the end, she had no choice but to sit down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She said coldly, &ldquo;I will use my actions to prove that I support charity.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled but said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at Wesley with disdain and said calmly, &ldquo;Mr. Ashford, I bid six million dollars. If you don&rsquo;t bid, this painting will be mine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you just say I won&rsquo;t get anything? Are you just bragging? Is what you said just bullshit?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s face was extremely gloomy, and his eyes were full of anger and murderous intent. If his gaze was a knife, he would have killed Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had warned Osborne before. If he gave in, all the big shots in Mayby City would laugh at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Wesley was reluctant to spend six million dollars to buy a worthless children&rsquo;s painting, he had no choice but to suppress his anger and continue to bid for the sake of his reputation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Seven million dollars!&rdquo; Wesley shouted and raised the bidding paddle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he looked at Osborne nervously. He endured the reluctance as he prayed that Osborne would not raise the bidding paddle again and stop bidding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, the reality went contrary to his wishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Under everyone&rsquo;s gaze, Osborne smiled and raised the bidding paddle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ten million dollars!&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
