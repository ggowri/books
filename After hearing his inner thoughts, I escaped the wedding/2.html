        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My call made Rock pause just as he was about to get into the backseat, but it was only a brief pause. He turned back, hastily explaining to me before instructing the driver to speed away:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry, a client suddenly has an urgent matter. I need to rush over there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was lying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, what he was really thinking was:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can tell from her voice that Delia is angry. If I don't go comfort her now, she probably won't let me come home tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I've never been one to just wallow in self-pity. Rather than overthinking things myself, it's better to take action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I directly found an excuse to meet Rock's secretary privately, using my mind-reading ability to gather more information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her name was Delia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was Rock's first love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delia was the illegitimate daughter of the Howard family. Mrs. Howard never acknowledged her, so her position had always been awkwardly ambiguous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, Rock's family opposed their relationship. Delia had too much pride and left Rock, disappearing without a trace after being humiliated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock's love at first sight for me was simply because I somewhat resembled Delia in appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that the real deal was back, he naturally didn't need me as a substitute anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The timing of Delia's return happened to coincide with Rock being exceptionally busy two months ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The logic was clear and fit perfectly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of story made me shake my head and laugh helplessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I never expected such a clich&eacute; "substitute" plot could apply to me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delia wanted to use hijacking the wedding as a way to declare her ownership of Rock, while also getting revenge on me for occupying the "Mrs. Bruce" position for so long. And Rock needed this occasion to prove his unwavering love for Delia, placate his angry little wife, and force his family to accept Delia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for me and this carefully prepared wedding, we were just props in their play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This world is just one big clich&eacute; romance novel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Honestly, it was so ridiculous I couldn't help but curse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, the lights in my apartment were still on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the wedding was the next day, I was busy packing my luggage without a moment's rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two hours ago, I had booked a first-class flight abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they want to play games, I can play too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Rock can let Delia hijack the wedding, I can naturally return the favor by pulling a "vanishing act" and running away from the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, my family had already settled abroad, and we hadn't made a big fuss inviting relatives and friends from there to this wedding. We only invited some close friends in the country.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, we thought since both sets of parents had met during the engagement, we could have another ceremony abroad later, saving relatives and friends the trouble of traveling back and forth with language barriers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This plan actually made it convenient for me to run away from the wedding now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I briefly told my best friend Trista about my thoughts. She silently took the packing box from my hands, looking serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to read her thoughts, I saw her reaction was off and had to ask:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Trista, are you going to stop me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Trista rolled her eyes and retorted:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hell no. I brought you a sturdy bag for packing stuff."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh right, I forgot Trista's family was in the agricultural business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the wedding day, dressed in a greeting gown, I stood with Rock welcoming guests from afar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, Rock's thoughts were so loud they gave me a headache:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Has Delia arrived yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can finally be with Delia. It's been three years, I've waited for Delia for three years. She's finally going to become Mrs. Bruce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With this wedding hijacking, Delia will believe my heart has never changed, right?"</p></div>
