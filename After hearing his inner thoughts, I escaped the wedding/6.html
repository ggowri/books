        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I also heard that Delia's been placing her people in Rock's company lately. She's got it made now&mdash;once she married into the Howard family, they acknowledged her status, and her own business took off too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nice to have powerful backing. When I think about how you worked so hard to bring resources to Rock before, and now Delia's reaping all the benefits, it just makes my blood boil."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I kept flipping through project materials while chatting with Trista on speaker:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't lose out&mdash;I made plenty of money playing between them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Rock's probably not having an easy time either. Sure, he has operational control, but the real decision-making power still lies with his father. He can't let Bruce Group turn into Howard Group in the end. Besides, he's not the only young person in the Bruce family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's hard to say for sure, but I know Rock's ambition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The company isn't his one-man show either. I suspect Delia's playing the game of placing people first and asking for forgiveness later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thanks to that wedding, domestic partners also know about the bad blood between Rock and me, so they've been feeding me information. For instance, the Bruce family directly pushed Rock's cousin into a prominent position&mdash;the pressure is pretty obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Love and career&mdash;I imagine Rock's caught in the middle and having a tough time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Trista was clearly dissatisfied with my comment:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean by that? Are you actually feeling sorry for him now? What's next, are you going to start sending him care packages?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I raised an eyebrow with a smile:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No care packages, but I'm wondering if I can use this opportunity to make some money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Impressive. I thought you were only focused on dating, but turns out you're a capitalist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But I never expected to receive a call from Rock two months later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tiffany."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing his voice after all this time made me shiver involuntarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rock? No wonder the professor refused to tell me the client's name, always just saying it was an old acquaintance. So it was you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I was pretty indifferent about Rock being able to find me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I went abroad, not to my grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The circles at home and abroad are only so big, and there aren't really any barriers in business nowadays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Rock wanted to find me, he just needed to put in a little extra effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tiffany, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His stammering attitude annoyed me enough to mentally roll my eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What "I" what? No matter what he said, what old times could I possibly reminisce about with a cheating ex-boyfriend? Not wishing for him to spiral into oblivion was already generous of me. This polite greeting was purely because he was the client.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I coldly interrupted Rock:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If there's nothing else, let me introduce this project to Mr. Bruce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock was obviously still caught up in his own emotions, bringing up the past:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tiffany, I'm very sorry about what happened back then. I know I hurt you deeply, which is why you ran away abroad in anger after calling off the wedding. I'm sorry, I really owe you an apology. I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I was silent for a moment, then sighed:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rock, did you get what you wanted?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other end of the line fell into a long silence, and Rock's voice suddenly sounded exhausted:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Delia is so different from before, so changed that I sometimes wonder if she's still the same Delia I once loved."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry, I know I shouldn't be disturbing your life now, but I just suddenly wanted to talk to you. I attended a reception today and suddenly remembered the days when we used to fight side by side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I let out a cold laugh and had no intention of continuing this relatively gentle conversation:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Mrs. Bruce knew you were keeping in touch with me, it wouldn't be appropriate. Audrey, come here please. Could you help me introduce this project to Mr. Bruce? I have other matters to attend to. Excuse me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how earth-shattering a first love might be, given enough time, it all becomes ordinary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What once seemed like tasteless mosquito blood suddenly becomes a treasure once it's out of reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how much love people receive, they'll always long for the love they didn't get.</p></div>
