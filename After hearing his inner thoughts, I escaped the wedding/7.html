        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Rock's confession, I only said one thing silently in my heart:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Serves you right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I left the entire follow-up of the project to my assistant Audrey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Occasionally, when there were things she wasn't sure about, I would provide guidance, but I tried to avoid direct contact with Rock as much as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I knew exactly what Rock was scheming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But betrayal&mdash;once it happens the first time, I would never give him a second chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Audrey went to China on my behalf and successfully secured the project. She also brought back another piece of news:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Bruce asked me to tell you that he's divorced."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Delia planted someone in the company, I already had a vague idea in mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I just didn't expect it to happen so quickly. Even when I messaged Trista about it, she seemed somewhat surprised:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just found out too. How did you get the news so fast?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I curled my lip:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He reconnected with me recently because of the project, and he specifically had my assistant pass this message along."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Trista clicked her tongue twice and picked up the conversation:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone knows what he's thinking, but why is this guy still hung up on you? What does he take you for, a backup? Disgusting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But do you know why they divorced? Delia played Rock like a fool. She was married before overseas, to some wealthy foreigner. She only came back to China after losing a lawsuit against her stepson and getting no money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When Mrs. Bruce found out, she was so angry her hands were shaking. Without a word, she slapped the photos right in Rock's face. You should've seen Rock's expression&mdash;it was so dark you could wring water out of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She'd already been pulling all sorts of stunts after marriage, and their relationship was getting colder by the day. Now that this came to light, Rock had someone draft divorce papers the very next day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The divorce went through so quickly. I remember when Rock was willing to give up his entire family fortune to be with her. They got married and divorced within just one year. Thinking about how he acted back then, he probably feels like a complete idiot now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I suddenly remembered Rock mentioning to me that "Delia had changed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I found it laughable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe Delia hadn't changed&mdash;she just didn't match Rock's imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the novelty wears off, true love slowly surfaces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Apart from business interactions, Rock and I had no further contact. I even chose to ignore the emails and friend requests he sent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was good at falling in love with a perfect image he created in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It used to be Delia, and now it was probably me again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Let him be. I already had my own new life now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Rock, to me now, he was just old news from the past, not worth mentioning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until Trista was preparing for her wedding that I returned to China and came to Harbor City after many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Returning to China with me was my daughter Kitty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My husband is a foreigner who was on an Antarctic research expedition when I returned to China, otherwise he would have accompanied me to the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After catching up with Trista, Kitty said she wanted to play at the children's playground in the nearby mall. Thinking she had no playmates in China, I nodded and took her hand to go there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kitty was obviously excited, almost running the whole way. Wearing high heels, I had some trouble keeping up behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a moment of inattention, Kitty bumped into someone at a corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I hurried to catch up and check on Kitty while apologizing:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, the child doesn't know better. Are you hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tiffany?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person sounded very surprised, and the voice was familiar. I looked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To be honest, I had to look closely before I could confirm it was him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly realizing that this mall seemed to belong to the Bruce Group, it wasn't strange for him to appear here. Whether in posture or temperament, Rock was vastly different from before, looking much more haggard and dejected. From a distance, he looked a bit like a 35-year-old dealing with the helplessness of mid-life layoffs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was completely different from the spirited man I remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock's face showed a hint of pleasant surprise, and he curved his lips slightly:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Long time no see. This is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My daughter, Kitty."</p></div>
