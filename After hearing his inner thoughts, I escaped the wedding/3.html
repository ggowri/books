        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I couldn't help but shudder and frown at Rock several times. But he didn't show it on his face, still caring for me in his usual gentle manner:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tiffany, you don't look well. Why don't you go rest in the lounge for a bit? I can greet the guests outside, and you can make your entrance when the ceremony starts."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That works.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, I should find an excuse to slip away soon anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I agreed, and just as I was about to change out of my little reception dress into casual clothes, I happened to run into Delia at the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thanks to our similar looks and my mind-reading ability, I recognized her at a glance. I held back Trista's arm as she was about to lunge at the mistress in her bridesmaid dress, pretending to be oblivious:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must be Rock's friend, right? Hurry inside, our wedding ceremony starts in a few hours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delia's smile froze, seemingly displeased by my intimate way of addressing Rock. Her words had a sarcastic tone:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Wood, I'm so sorry, but we seem to be wearing similar dresses today. If people who don't know better see us, won't they think I'm the bride?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delia's arrogant thoughts rang out in sync:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go ahead and smile. In three hours, your groom will run away with me. Let's see if you can still smile then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I maintained my smile, shaking my head indifferently. I instructed a nearby waiter to show her to her seat:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Idiot, I've made it this obvious and she still doesn't realize I'm here to cause trouble?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As we passed each other, Trista couldn't help but complain to me:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you see how arrogant she looked? I can't stand it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I nodded noncommittally:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She sees me as a joke now, after all Rock is prepared to let her hijack the wedding. Not only can the lovers finally be together, but she can also force the Bruce family to acknowledge her status in front of me. "</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding venue wasn't far from the airport. I sat in the waiting lounge, staring at the time on my phone, waiting for the farce to begin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My phone vibrated continuously as Trista excitedly spammed me with live updates:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tiffany, it's really happening! It's really happening!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn, they're making their affair look like some epic love story. So shameless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The official ceremony had only started five minutes ago when Trista sent me a video of the wedding scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to the program, after Rock went on stage and the host gave a sappy, emotional speech about their love story, the bride was supposed to make her entrance. And Delia planned to hijack the wedding at this crucial moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delia deliberately wore the same greeting dress as the bride, quickly went up on stage and snatched the microphone from the host.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the murmurs from the audience below, she poured out her love in an endless stream. Her bold and blatant words brought tears to Rock's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rock, will you come with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guest seats erupted in an uproar. Taking away the groom on his wedding day - wasn't this blatant wedding hijacking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The worst part was that Rock nodded in agreement with a moved expression, walking to Delia's side and interlocking their fingers:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delia's vanity was fully satisfied at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even had the mood to give an "acceptance speech" to the bride separated by a large door, basically saying she knew I really liked Rock, but Rock loved her the most, and she hoped I would give them my blessing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the video, Rock was wearing a pair of sneakers that clashed horribly with his formal suit. Delia could barely contain the smugness in her expression as she held the microphone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delia was probably eager to see my devastated reaction. She had even prepared comforting words in her mind:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I hope Miss Wood can give her blessing to this beautiful love story between me and Rock."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Wood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere suddenly became extremely awkward at this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the person being humiliated wasn't there, so this triumphant scene just became a clownish farce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Wood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Wood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delia called out several times with no response, until the etiquette officer opened the large doors. Behind them was an empty space, with only the carelessly discarded Bruce veil symbolizing the bride's unknown whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd suddenly became noisy, and someone shouted:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Holy crap, did the bride run away from the wedding too?"</p></div>
