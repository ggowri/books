        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So when I suggested coming back, my parents agreed quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even as I had just gotten off the plane, my parents had already arranged for someone to pick me up. When I got into the car, Trista was still excitedly telling me about what happened afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The wedding fell apart in the end. Later, the guests left in small groups, leaving only some staff members. Our family and the Bruce family have a good relationship, so we stayed behind to comfort Mrs. Bruce, who was so angry she could barely stand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mrs. Bruce was so furious she slapped Rock right across the face. I'd say he deserved it. Everyone knows how much you helped him rise to power back then, and Delia is just an illegitimate daughter. Pulling this ungrateful runaway bride stunt in public didn't make the Bruce family look good either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Bruce didn't even look at him and just left. Only Delia was left there crying and wailing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When I left, I still saw Delia crying and clinging to Rock, begging him to hold the wedding. I guess she felt like she'd really lost face this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I let out a cold laugh:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Those who humiliate others will be humiliated in return. I'm waiting for them to hold their wedding. If they actually have a wedding day, I'll genuinely wish them well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power of first love lies in the fact that even when she shows up in person, it doesn't work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I think Rock will understand this principle very soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock and I met at a charity gala.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the Steele family's business had all been transferred overseas, my parents and I were all originally from New York. My parents were getting on in years, and the long international flights were taking a toll on their health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That trip back was part business, part reconnecting with my roots. I never expected to meet what I thought was my soulmate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock called out to me then, holding a wine glass with a gentle smile and graceful demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of my mind-reading ability, I rarely initiated conversations with people at public events unless necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The social scene was just too noisy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Rock called out to me, the impatience on my face hadn't even faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But strangely, I couldn't hear any of his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps because it was so quiet, I gradually found the patience to chat with him. Later, when he confessed to me, he was even shy, not knowing where to put his hands and feet, his hands holding the roses trembling slightly:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tiffany, I'll be good to you for the rest of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">We looked into each other's eyes, and I couldn't read his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So I nodded, believed Rock's promise, and was willing to stay in the country and marry him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I never doubted that moment's promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But promises only count when you're in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In my eyes, Delia and Rock's love story was really just a tale of childhood love that couldn't be fulfilled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delia might not be as wonderful as Rock imagined, and Rock might not love Delia as much as he thought he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Love is only most touching when it's unattainable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half a month later, when I had just finished Professor Esther's design class, I received a call from Trista:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remember we got that bastard's wedding invitation a few days ago? When I went over today, I thought it was some village banquet. It wasn't even as lively as when I went up north to eat that pig slaughter feast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Trista was obviously a reporter on the front lines of gossip, chattering away about this farcical wedding:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Old Mr. Bruce didn't even show up. A lot of people didn't come to this wedding either. It was nothing compared to yours back then. The ceremony was held in a side hall, and only Mrs. Bruce came with a dark expression, coldly drinking the tea ceremony coffee. Forget about giving red envelopes - she still called her Delia."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"During the speech, she was still lecturing Delia about being well-behaved and knowing propriety and shame. Haha, I tell you, when the older generation scolds people with that cultural flair, it's really harsh."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It made Delia so angry she threw her bouquet on the stage. Rock had to comfort his mom on one side and his wife on the other. I almost laughed myself breathless watching it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, it was pretty normal. Given Mrs. Bruce's personality, not holding this wedding would have been more her style, but she couldn't resist Delia whispering in her son's ear, so she had to suppress her anger and attend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Delia had already offended her mother-in-law before even getting married. Could she possibly have good days ahead?</p></div>
