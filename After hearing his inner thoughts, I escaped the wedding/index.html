        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I Have a Special Mind Reading Ability: I Can Hear the Thoughts of Those Who Don't Love Me</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the eve of my wedding, I suddenly heard my fianc&eacute;'s thoughts:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If she tries to hijack the wedding tomorrow, running away in dress shoes might not be the best idea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I kept quiet and decisively boarded a flight out of the country the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later, that wedding became the talk of the town - both the bride and groom had run away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I've always possessed a special mind-reading ability: I can hear the thoughts of people who don't love me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This ability allows me to easily judge whether someone's love for me is genuine or fake. I can quickly distance myself from fake friendships and remain unmoved by confessions from long-time crushes. Even when buying durian, I can use the vendor's thoughts to pick the one with the most flesh and sweetest taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because I can hear every single thought clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To avoid too much mental noise, I usually avoid eye contact with strangers in daily life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when I first met Rock, the world became so quiet that I could only hear our clear dialogue:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, may I get to know you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When our eyes met, I couldn't read Rock's thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the time Rock pursued me, the sounds in my ears were simple and pure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I believed he truly loved me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So we fell in love, dated, and then talked about marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For two whole years, I never heard his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But on the eve of our wedding, I suddenly could hear Rock's thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to the wedding, Rock had been especially busy lately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He came from a wealthy family and had successfully taken over his father's position, independently managing the family's financial company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of the wedding itinerary, we had many things to handle in advance, especially in the last two months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I've always been an independent woman and respected Rock's career as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So we hadn't seen each other much lately. But today, as we were finalizing the outfits, I couldn't help feeling sweet at the thought of our rare time together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When I arrived at the studio on time, he was already there trying on shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying something to the staff, he walked out while talking on the phone, his tone very reassuring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I could understand his busyness; managing a company wasn't easy, especially since the Bruce family had more than one heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">We exchanged a knowing glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But suddenly I heard Rock's voice in my head:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Delia says she's going to hijack the wedding tomorrow. I should wear sneakers to run more easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Delia? Hijack the wedding?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I froze on the spot, staring at his mouth, confirming this was indeed his inner thoughts. I didn't know how to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though it was a hot summer day outside, a chill spread through my body, paralyzing me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I could hear his thoughts now, and the implications were obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the staff following his instructions, placing a pair of comfortable sneakers with the wedding attire. Rock nodded at me and prepared to walk out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was our tacit understanding; he probably had some important matter to handle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the words I just heard in my mind were undeniable, and I never mishear thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My body almost moved on its own, following him. I called out, somewhat in disbelief:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rock?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I was eager to read more of his thoughts, to understand what this man who bore the title of my fianc&eacute; was really thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did he suddenly have a change of heart right before the wedding?</p></div>
