        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the quiet waiting lounge, I suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course I had to fulfill their wishes. After all, there were people I knew among the guests below, and it really was my fault for standing them up by running away from the wedding. So I might as well treat them to a good show for free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching all this unfold, I couldn't help but shake my head and laugh. Just then, the big screen suddenly displayed some text and images, with bright red font that read:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Runaway Bride Statement."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Due to Rock's affair with his mistress Delia, I hereby decide to escape this wedding. I'm granting you both this farce. I hope you'll behave yourselves in the future and stop running around harming others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Below were thoughtfully attached recent intimate photos of Rock and Delia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My phone buzzed. Trista sent me a message:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mission accomplished!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this message, I also posted the same statement on WhatsApp - this would be the last message from this number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd at the venue immediately erupted. Now who had time to laugh at me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bigger joke was standing right there on stage, hand in hand, wasn't it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the bride gone, who would care whether Rock and Delia ran off or not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Delia's earlier soliloquy about love on stage looked particularly ridiculous against the backdrop of the bright red word "affair" on the big screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What beautiful love story? It was nothing but a cover-up for cheating and betrayal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Trista was thrilled watching the drama unfold, but within two minutes she sent me another video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the video, no one paid attention to the two idiots standing dumbfounded on stage. The crowd was frantically searching for me:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where's Tiffany?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where did Ms. Steele go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where's the bride? Her phone's not answering - why aren't you looking for her! Did you check the dressing room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Check the changing rooms, the penthouse, everywhere! What are you all standing around for! Move, move!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the perpetually stern Mr. and Mrs. Du urgently stood up to direct the staff in searching for me, and the guests joined in the search.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not a single person cared about the two people on stage - even the officiant was called down from the platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock and Delia just stood there awkwardly on stage, staring at each other like monkeys put on public display, completely at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was even funnier was that the audience below was busy looking for me, the missing main character, with no one caring whether they should leave or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The romantic and thrilling wedding hijacking scene that Delia and Rock had fantasized about was turned into chaos by my sudden disappearance, like elderly folks scrambling for free eggs at a supermarket entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them just stood there on stage. This wedding - they couldn't escape it, but they couldn't not escape it either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they ran, no one cared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they didn't run, no one cared either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When it was about time, I used another WhatsApp account to send Trista a message about boarding, then sent my parents a brief explanation of the situation, instructing them not to reveal any of my private information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then I put my phone on airplane mode and settled comfortably into first class, enjoying the dozen-plus hours of flight time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as I landed, Trista's messages came flooding in frantically. It seemed the aftermath of this incident was quite entertaining. Even when I replied to the first message, Trista couldn't contain herself and immediately called me:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha, Tiffany, that move was absolutely ruthless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have no idea - Harbor City is in complete chaos right now. All the guests were relatives and friends of the Bruce family, and many were prominent figures. When you ran away from the wedding, their side went absolutely crazy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Those two idiots stood on stage for a full ten minutes with no one paying attention to them. Finally they had to walk down by themselves. I was so embarrassed for them I could've dug out a sea-view apartment right there on the spot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Check the trending topics now - that video shot straight to number one. Netizens are calling those two living treasures. That bastard even went to your villa, and when he saw you weren't there, he was jumping mad at your front door."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He was pressing your doorbell like he was sending morse code - beep beep beep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was just about to slip away when he caught up with me. That guy had the nerve to ask where you were. I just said you went abroad and I didn't know anything else. Hilarious - I've got to say, running in sneakers is pretty fast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just hearing Trista laughing breathlessly, I knew how badly this whole thing had rattled Rock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't get his wedding hijacked, and he lost all face himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock's reaction didn't surprise me at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock dared to do this because he was certain that for the sake of both the Bruce family and Steele family reputations, I wouldn't make a big scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, even if my wedding was hijacked, I could only swallow my pride and take it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the Steele family business was overseas, so the Bruce family wouldn't be too affected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could even use this opportunity to pressure Rock's parents into accepting Delia as their daughter-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, with things having gone this far, not acknowledging her in front of so many guests would really be embarrassing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Rock never expected that I would run away from the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I directly ripped off that fig leaf and shoved it down his and Delia's throats to disgust them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let them be. Love is enjoyment, but when it comes to marriage, that's endurance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cinderella and the prince don't just live happily on their wedding day - what they have to face day after day afterward is the grinding reality of daily life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When you've hit a dead end, you should turn around in time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having dodged an unhappy marriage, I was ready to set off fireworks in celebration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My parents had settled abroad years ago, where the dating culture is open and pursues freedom and spontaneity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, Rock and I hadn't even gotten our marriage certificate yet - legally speaking, we weren't even husband and wife.</p></div>
