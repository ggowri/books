        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Our eyes met, but this time I couldn't hear his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard you got married a long time ago, but I never expected your daughter to be this grown up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kitty spoke up before I could:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry, uncle, I bumped into you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock paused for a moment, then finally reached out to pat Kitty's head, crouching down with a smile:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, Kitty. Just remember not to run so fast next time. Manager Wang, could you take Kitty to the children's playground over there for a bit? Tiffany, there's a new coffee shop on the second floor with your old favorite Robusta. Mind having a chat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I nodded and gave Kitty a few instructions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, before coming back, that big mouth Trista had already filled me in on Rock's current situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The whole Delia incident had hit Rock hard, and the Bruce family had shifted their support to his cousin instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Rock, he was awkwardly sidelined by the Bruce family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The former golden boy had become an outsider.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Love was gone, career was ruined. Despite being in the prime of his life, he was shrouded in a heavy air of melancholy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, one Robusta and one con panna, please. Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Actually, could you change the Robusta to a Vienna coffee instead?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock asked with a smile:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Changed your taste? I remember you never liked those sweet, creamy coffees before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I shook my head:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My husband always says Robusta has too much caffeine and it's bad for the stomach if you drink too much. He always switches it to Vienna for me. After drinking it for so long, I've grown to like sweet coffee."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's nice. I saw your wedding ceremony - very romantic. That was the famous castle in Switzerland, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I happened to be on a business trip there, so I stopped by to take a look."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Bruce family had no business in Switzerland. But I didn't call him out on it, just smiled and went along with the small talk like ordinary friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Would it be okay if you accepted my friend request? I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I set down my coffee cup, still smiling gently as I responded to Rock:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's just leave it. I know what you mean, but you don't need to worry about it. For me, that's all in the past. Besides, back then, you were obviously the one who was more embarrassed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I did love you once, but I truly don't anymore. I have a happy family, a husband who loves me, and an adorable daughter. Someone living a completely new life wouldn't want to stay in touch with someone who made mistakes in the old days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rock, what's missed is missed. Whether it's love or hate, none of it matters anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My overly calm and detached expression stung him, and Rock's eyes reddened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When I went back to find Kitty, Manager Wang was holding a fairy tale book, reading attentively with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until I approached that Kitty looked up and asked:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mommy, have you read 'The Little Prince'? The fox was so wonderful - why did the Little Prince still choose that rose in the end?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because it was the rose he had carefully tended to, his one and only rose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kitty looked puzzled, so I smiled and took her hand:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When Kitty gets a little older, she'll understand what Mommy means."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rock had been quiet the whole time, only giving Kitty a brand new copy of "The Little Prince" as we left the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Through the car window, Rock and I nodded our goodbyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that moment when our eyes met, I still couldn't read his thoughts, just like when we first met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car slowly pulled away, leaving the familiar figure behind as I held my daughter's soft body close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was my final act of revenge against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A gentle and graceful exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From now on, memories would be our only way of meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And I would replace Delia, becoming the unattainable love in Rock's life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Rock's world, the love he could never have wouldn't be a sudden storm, but a lifelong dampness. He would forever be trapped in this dampness, stirring up tempests in every otherwise calm day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I had once been the fox, and also that red rose, but now I was simply the Little Prince who had finished his journey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My daughter held up her phone:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mommy, Daddy wants to talk to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Coming!"</p></div>
