  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler furrowed his brow as he fixed his gaze on Angelo. "Angelo, what's this urgent matter that couldn't be discussed back at base? Why did you bring us out here? Something feels off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, both Arnold and Mariah shot skeptical looks at Angelo, their body language tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo offered a calm smile. "Just hang tight; we'll be there soon! Trust me, it's going </span><span>to be a matter that'll shake you to your core!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angelo landed near Osborne's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler hesitated but ultimately decided to follow, confident in his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt much stronger than Angelo, convinced that unless Angelo had lost his mind, Angelo wouldn't be playing any tricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there were a scheme, Chandler wouldn't be the least bit afraid of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Chandler, Arnold and Mariah shrugged and quickly joined him, convinced that Angelo wouldn't dare pull anything underhanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew damn well that Angelo didn't have the chops</span><span>, </span><span>or the balls</span><span>, </span><span>for something like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, is that a lowly Human Community member?" Chandler said, spotting Osborne standing there calmly, unperturbed by their approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no traps</span><span>, </span><span>after all, ordinary traps wouldn't even faze Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they discovered any traps, there was a chance that the three would keep their distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply nodded at Angelo without showing any signs of malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler, although he noticed Osborne, brushed it off. In his perception, Osborne was just an insignificant Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Chandler's power, even a top-tier Deity Overlord would be an easy target to squash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, he watched as Angelo seemed to be leading them here for the opportunity to meet Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angelo, what's going on here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You brought us to meet this lowly human? Who is this guy?" Arnold couldn't hold back his skepticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's expression turned serious. "You're treading on thin ice, Arnold. How dare you speak disrespectfully to my Lord?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arnold stared blankly, and Chandler and Mariah exchanged incredulous glances as if they couldn't believe their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord? What do you mean, 'my Lord'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's unease grew, but his self-confidence kept him calm. He was increasingly intrigued by both Angelo and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angelo, what gives? Care to explain yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Angelo opened his mouth to respond, Osborne stepped forward, placing himself between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a faint smile, he addressed the trio, "Let me introduce myself; I'm Osborne Augustine. Angelo here is now one of my subordinates. I brought you here because I'd like you to join him and serve me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think it over; if you submit, you'll be spared a lot of pain! If you refuse... well, I'll just have to beat you into submission before I bring you into the fold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell, thick and heavy, as the words hung in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler, Arnold, and Mariah stared at Osborne in disbelief, each of them struggling to comprehend what they had just heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler thought he must be dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Did I fall into an illusion? Am I really hearing this absurdity from a lowly human?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A being with just Deity Overlord-level power was claiming that Angelo is his subordinate? Demanding our loyalty? Threatening to rough us up if we refuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Illusion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler glanced at Arnold and Mariah for confirmation, seeking some clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arnold scoffed, a cold smile on his face. "No, this isn't an illusion! I'm not even in a meditative state, so how could I be in an Illusion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, the three realized they were wide awake, and shock settled over them like a heavy blanket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I hear you right, you lowly human fool? What did you just say? Why don't you say that again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's voice dripped with cold disdain as a terrifying wave of killing intent radiated from him</span><span> and </span><span>envelop</span><span>ed</span><span> both Osborne and Angelo in its icy grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span> faint smile appear</span><span>ed</span><span> on his face. "I said, if you all want to avoid some pain, you'd better submit to me. If not, then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could finish his thought, Chandler exploded into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A torrent of flames erupted, enveloping Osborne instantly, the searing heat threatening to incinerate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler spat, his voice thick with contempt. "You're asking for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A pathetic human thinks you can demand our submission and make us your minions? Ha! You've lost your mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem. Just take you out, and this will all be over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The icy malice in Chandler's gaze was palpable as the roaring flames consumed the air around Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's expression hardened dramatically, his eyes wide with alarm as he rushed forward to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could reach Osborne, Chandler waved a hand dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The inferno redirected toward Angelo, who fought desperately to defend himself. Even so, the flames knocked him backwar</span><span>d and</span><span> le</span><span>ft</span><span> his face pale and strained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler laughed coldly, a sinister glint in his eyes. "Angelo, you must be losing it, too! So, you can join him in dying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, even fiercer flames ignited around him, ready to burn everything in their path.</span></p><div class="pagination">
