  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After introducing Diana to the group, Osborne and his entourage finally set off toward Celestial Crystal Mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Deathborn Kingdom already vanquished, they no longer had to worry about danger. Osborne ordered Angelo and the others to stay on alert while he continued to fill his grandfather and the others in on everything that had happened since they parted ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Celestara Human Community is in such dire straits!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has the situation for Human Community really become this perilous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence is utterly despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paramount Supreme Clan is just as despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're supposed to be part of Human Community, yet they want to annihilate Celestara's people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those dastardly invaders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, Bryce, and Kendra were seething with righteous indignation, and their anger was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Sebastian, Divine Shadow, and God of Star wore grave expressions. Their brows were furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation in Celestara was far more complex and perilous than they had anticipated. One misstep could lead to the utter destruction of the entire Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had all reached the pinnacle of the Deity Overlord realm, even they felt powerless to change the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian couldn't help but speak up, "If only we could all break through to become Deity Kings</span><span>! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, only </span><span>Anastasia</span><span> </span><span>is certain to become a Deity King</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And </span><span>only Mila, Zoe, Bryce, and Kendra have a real shot at it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>The rest of us... </span><span>W</span><span>ell, we've already </span><span>used</span><span> most of our potential. Breaking through to </span><span>a </span><span>Deity King is </span><span>nearly</span><span> impossible for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at </span><span>them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though all were at the peak of Deity Overlord realm, each with six Divine Flames hovering above their heads, the colors of those flames varied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's flame burned a deep purple, signifying her Divine Body had already reached Level Seven</span><span>. That was</span><span> the standard for a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was, in essence, a Quasi-Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila, Zoe, Bryce, and Kendra, on the other hand, sported blue flames, indicating they possessed Level Six Divine Bodies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one more step, they could evolve into Level Seven, giving them a significant chance of ascending to Deity King</span><span> level</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, God of Star, and Divine Shadow were a different story. Their flames shimmered with a Level Five hue, a stark reminder of their limited potential. They had reached their current heights by squeezing every last drop of their </span><span>gifts</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they managed to break through further, their Divine Bodies would only reach Level Six, falling short of the Deity King standard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would be Quasi-Deity Kings at best, never true Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their potential had been exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped in, and his voice was calm yet resolute. "Grandpa, don't worry about potential. I'll figure something out for all of you. In Celestara, there are forty-two divine peaks, each teeming with Miracle Elixirs that can enhance potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On top of that, Celestial Crystals can boost potential, too, though not as powerfully as Miracle Elixirs. If we can gather enough of these elixirs and crystals, your potential will surge again, and breaking through to Deity King won't be a problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words trailed off, a glint of determination flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the Blood Demon members, who are all but hopeless due to their limited potential, will become Deity Kings. I'll make sure of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But to do that, I'll need a mountain of Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian and the others perked up at Osborne's words, and their faces lighted up with hope and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can potential really be boosted? Are you just trying to cheer us up?" Sebastian asked, and his voice was tinged with both disbelief and cautious optimism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a knowing smile. "Grandpa, if you don't trust me, ask Diana. She'll confirm it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana smiled warmly in response, "Osborne's not lying. The potential really can be boosted. As luck would have it, I've still got half a stalk of Miracle Elixir left. You guys can give it a try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pulled out the remaining half of the white Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian shook his head hastily, and his hands raised in polite refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no! I couldn't possibly take your Miracle Elixir. I believe you both."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others echoed Sebastian's sentiments. Diana had no choice but to tuck the elixir away once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped forward confidently. "Don't worry. We'll soon have enough Miracle Elixir and Celestial Crystal to go around! There's no doubt that everyone's potential will be enhanced. At the very least, you'll all break through to Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Judging by the intel, we're just ahead of the Celestial Crystal Mine. Fingers crossed, it's all accurate. We need that Celestial Crystal badly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes gleamed with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group exchanged eager glances, and their yearning for Celestial Crystal was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that they knew of its potential to boost capabilities and quicken the pathway to Deity King, the foggy gorge ahead seemed to shimmer with promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angelo, take a few men and scout ahead. Check for any hazards inside the canyon," Osborne commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Angelo responded without hesitation, leading figures like Edison into the mist-cloaked canyon. Their figures soon dissolved into the haze, leaving the others in a tense, expectant silence. Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, intently monitoring Angelo's progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Angelo and his team reappeared, stepping back into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, the canyon is clear of any threat. Everything's calm," Angelo said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's move in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the group ventured deeper into the foggy canyon, Osborne scanned the surroundings with his Satan's Eye, methodically searching for any trace of Celestial Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his eyes lit up with a spark of discovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestial Crystal!" he exclaimed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
