  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the ordeal dragged on, Osborne felt himself reaching his limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood flowed freely from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vision was a blur of red, and his eyes felt as if they were about to burst. They were no longer his own, and he was seeing nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Godfather hadn't personally taught him the method to ascend to Level Four, Osborne would have shut down Satan's Eye long ago, fearing for his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was still holding on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The agony spread from his eyes to his brain, slowing his thoughts until they became sluggish and unclear. A single, powerful thought took root in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shut off Satan's Eye, and the agony would stop!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shut it off, and there would be other chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just shut it...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a fierce roar, a primal sound like a wild beast. His teeth clenched so tightly that blood trickled from the corners of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't give up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I absolutely can't give up! Anastasia is waiting for me to save her. I can't waste a single second!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I absolutely can't give up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled violently, wracked with pain that sent spasms through his muscles. With a single thought, he could temporarily shut down Satan's Eye and end his suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty minutes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty-five minutes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty-eight minutes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty-nine minutes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his mind and body reaching their absolute limit. He was numb as if his body was no longer his own. He could barely even feel the Satan's Eye anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a drowning man, about to lose consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, an hour passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne's body convulsed violently as an icy chill emanated from his left eye, enveloping him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All prior discomfort vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, Osborne felt a drastic transformation within his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, an evolution!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fourth silver star gradually materialized within his left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silver star shimmered briefly. Then, a faint golden glow enveloped it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silver star!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden glow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne didn't see these changes as the golden light gradually faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything was over, Osborne breathed heavily and his face filled with the feeling of having survived a disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did it succeed? I thought that reaching level four without any items would be the easiest upgrade, but it turned out to be the hardest! Luckily, I persevered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather didn't even tell me that I only had one chance. If I had failed this upgrade, my Satan's Eye would have exhausted its potential and would never be able to reach level four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a trap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a deep sense of relief. The moment Satan's Eye ascended to level four, he distinctly felt that had he given up earlier, Satan's Eye would have lost all its potential, remaining stuck at level three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness I held on! Otherwise, I'd be full of regrets right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself as he began to explore the changes in Satan's Eye at level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level four Satan's Eye now possessed the ability to emit Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this power was not yet activated; he still needed to find an elemental metahuman and absorb their elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without this new ability, Satan's Eye had significantly improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dynamic and static vision had become even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye activated, the Draco Model H mini-handgun, which could fire at a speed of seven thousand feet per second, seemed to move at a snail's pace, incredibly slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, his X-ray vision had also grown stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At level two, Satan's Eye already had x-ray vision, but it could only see through half a feet of concrete. By level three, it could penetrate three one-foot-thick concrete walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with level four Satan's Eye, his X-ray vision was even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten concrete walls could not block his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, he could see through a 16-foot-thick concrete wall. If it were a brick or wooden fence, it would be even more accessible; even dozens of walls could not stop his X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The range of his X-ray vision had also increased from 328 feet radius to 1640 feet radius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that within 1640 feet radius, there was nothing that could obstruct Osborne's vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's dope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed. Activating the X-ray vision of Satan's Eye was like having a God's-eye view, absolutely incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what Osborne cared about most was how much his ability to manipulate matter with ocular energy had improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a level three Satan's Eye, his ocular energy could lift 2200 pounds of weight and influence objects within four hundred feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with a level four Satan's Eye, he could lift ten thousand pounds and extend his influence to 17 hundred feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he concentrated his ocular energy into a punch, the maximum force of a single blow would be ten thousand pounds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody could withstand that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a bull would be sent flying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thrilled. After testing the strength of his level four Satan's Eye, he finally calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time to figure out how to activate the new ability of the level four Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Devil's Light?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What will it look like?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
