  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Winning by relying on equipment isn't exactly a skill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce scoffed, though everyone could hear the jealousy in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supreme Malevolence Sword and Supreme Malevolence Shield were both Ultimate divine artifacts</span><span>, </span><span>extremely rare and incredibly powerful. With those two artifacts, Alfred's attack and defense were amplified significantly, enhancing his overall strength to an incredible degree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, if those two divine artifacts were handed to any peak Deity Overlord, they would have a fighting chance against a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred was already a super genius with formidable power, and with the added boost from the Ultimate divine artifacts, it was no surprise he could easily defeat the Mystic Feather Clan's Deity King warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke up calmly, "Equipment is part of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every name on Hannah's list comes from a powerful background, at least from one of the top ten Upper Races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They all have access to formidable divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While they might not have two Ultimate divine artifacts like Alfred, they certainly won't lack top-grade divine artifacts. When we face them, we're at a disadvantage in that regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry</span><span>. W</span><span>hile we might not have any Ultimate divine artifacts now, we can always snatch them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sparked excitement among the crowd, their eyes lighting up with the </span><span>thought of rushing in to take Alfred down and snatch his Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, they held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's keep watching the fight! Defeating Alfred is the Mystic Feather Clan's only chance at survival. Even though Alfred has shown incredible strength, they won't give up easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to his words, the second Deity King from the Mystic Feather Clan soon stepped into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Osborne and the others who noticed that Alfred was relying on the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield; the Mystic Feather Clan warriors realized it, too. However, they kept their mouths shut, knowing that boasting about their own abilities wouldn't help their cause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, relying on divine artifacts was still a part of strength. If the other side had what they didn't, it simply meant they were outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second Deity King warrior from the Mystic Feather Clan approached with a newfound caution. He understood that Alfred wielded the Supreme Malevolence Sword, which was capable of slicing through his defenses and inflicting serious damage. He also recognized that Alfred's Supreme Malevolence Shield made it nearly impossible for ordinary attacks to harm Alfred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of rushing in, he opted for a hit-and-run strategy, aiming to wear Alfred down without getting easily defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred, however, wasn't fazed in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking smile spread across his face. "You think you can tire me out? That someone else will step in and take me down? Nice thought, but it won't work on me! Just give in already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfred ramped up his assault. Protected by the Supreme Malevolence Shield, he showed no intention of defending or dodging, forcing the Mystic Feather Clan's Deity King warrior into a corner where escape was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second Deity King warrior was swiftly taken down by Alfred, who still radiated divine power as if he hadn't expended much energy at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this unfold, the Mystic Feather Clan warriors, who had briefly felt a glimmer of hope, began to feel the weight of despair settle back in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take my turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third Deity King warrior from the Mystic Feather Clan stepped up, adopting the same strategy as his predecessor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused on defense and evasion, aiming to wear Alfred down. With his impressive speed, he managed to hold out for quite a while before finally succumbing to Alfred's relentless onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone could sense that Alfred's power had weakened somewhat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gave the Mystic Feather Clan a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep wearing him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the Mystic Feather Clan's Deity King warriors attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't give Alfred a moment to rest, constantly draining his divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of challengers kept growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred defeated four more Deity Kings from the Mystic Feather Clan, showcasing the full might of the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Supreme Malevolence Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers couldn't help but feel a greedy twinge in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, both the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Supreme Malevolence Shield were exclusive to the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much they craved them, they dared not act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Alfred was incredibly weakened. Though he had taken down seven Deity King warriors from the Mystic Feather Clan, his power was almost completely drained. It seemed he wouldn't be able to continue the fight much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Feather Clan was brimming with excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred was about to reach his breaking point!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they still had three Deity King warriors who hadn't joined the fray. If they continued to push him, Alfred would surely succumb to his exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the Mystic Feather Clan was basking in their newfound hope, Alfred suddenly sneered and swallowed a pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, his power surged back to its peak.</span></p><div class="pagination">
