  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the personnel from the Wild Flame Army dispatched to support Divine Peak Nine this time, only seven occupied positions superior to Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of them were brigadier generals, while the other five were leaders of ten thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already learned that he was temporarily assigned under a leader named Athena, the only woman among the five leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Athena hovered above the first of the top-grade Malevolence Airships, sending out a summons to Osborne and the other ten </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span> under her command, instructing them to gather near her ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a moment to size her up as he approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mid-stage Deity Overlord," he muttered, frowning slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current level of power, facing a Deity Overlord at the early stage wasn't too daunting. With just his Thunder Power, he could easily suppress or even defeat most early-stage warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a mid-stage Deity Overlord posed a different challenge entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leap between these small realms was substantial, and mid-stage Deity Overlords were significantly stronger than their early-stage counterparts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne relied solely on Thunder Power, he had no confidence in his ability to hold his ground against someone of Athena's caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way he could hope to contend with her would be to tap into dark power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, merely putting up a fight would require all he had; defeating her would necessitate unleashing his spatial power at full throttle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, recalling her background, "Who would've thought Athena would be a mid-stage Deity Overlord?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That complicates things. She hails from the Upper Race Soaring Lion Clan and is part of the Huntington family. Oswald's wife, Christine, is her sister!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I hope she doesn't take a dislike to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he and his team arrived near Athena's Malevolence Airship, they merged with the other </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span> and fell silent, waiting for further orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne observed that his other thousand-person unit had not been placed under Athena's command but rather under a leader named Dwight Saxton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chiliarch there, Steven Saxton, was a distinct figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used the roots of his Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to discreetly send Steven a message, urging him to carry on with caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, scanning the crowd of </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span>, he was suddenly caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them stood someone he knew all too well, Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Calvin spotted Osborne, a cold sneer spread across his face, conveying nothing but disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin is here to support Divine Peak Nine? He's been the head of the Swift family for some time and is supposed to stay safe, given the family's influence. I can't believe he'd take such a risk himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Considering he recently married Nydia, Oswald's illegitimate daughter, he's made himself quite comfortable with the Borden family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now my direct superior, Athena, is Christine's sister. This is precarious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinking feeling crept into Osborne's gut as he noted the glances of the other </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes held a chilly edge, their lips twisting into mocking smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, a serious look crossing his face, "This isn't good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I sense hostility here. Are they all ganging up on me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin is Oswald's daughter's husband, and Athena is Christine's sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christine is married to Oswald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a tangled web they weave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other </span><span>chiliarchs</span><span> could easily be allies of Athena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's starting to look like I'm being set up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Guy seems clueless about this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts raced through his mind, Osborne's expression turned icy. He quickly reached out to Guy, who was still stationed back at their base, using the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to establish a connection. He needed to get to the bottom of the situation, and fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne maintained a calm facade as he waited for Guy's response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long before Guy's voice echoed in his mind, relayed through the roots of the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, I've confirmed it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Athena is indeed plotting against you, but Oswald isn't involved in this. He's too preoccupied with his conflicts with the Saxton family to focus on you. This seems to be Athena's own initiative!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not sure of the specifics, but it likely has something to do with Calvin. Recently, he's been getting close to Athena, leveraging his connection with Oswald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold snort escaped Osborne at Guy's revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted with fierceness. "</span><span>So</span><span> it's Calvin who wants to take me down, huh? That makes sense. He's hated me for ages! He's convinced I've stumbled upon some ancient god's treasure, which is why I've amassed so many Essence Crystals and artifacts. Now he's trying to pressure me into handing them over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Teaming up with Athena just to get at me&mdash;what a cowardly move!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
