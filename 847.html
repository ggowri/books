Maybe I can really suck Mosley dry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, persevering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Mosley was on the verge of insanity. Her blood energy was draining rapidly, and she was powerless to stop it. She now felt the despair that Osborne had experienced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed, "What the hell is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, damn it all! Let me go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the future Mosley, the ruler of the stars, a true deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I die in the hands of a mere mortal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her blood energy continued to drain, Mosley's body gradually withered, her breath became weaker, and her life force rapidly faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She begged, "Please, just let me go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am a true deity. If you release me, I can give you everything you desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can make you the ruler of this planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can even take you into the dazzling space, where you can witness the prosperity of countless alien races. Please, I don't want to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Mosley's pleas, Osborne remained unmoved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in a precarious situation himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mosley's blood energy was absorbed by his bones, he began to feel that they, too, were reaching their limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrible power surged within his skeleton, making it stronger but also pushing it to the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint glow emitted from his bones, indicating the escaping energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists.

Cracks appeared on his flesh, and blood oozed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his bones, now emitting a bright glow, seemed to groan in pain as cracks rapidly spread across them, threatening to explode at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This is the end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's blood energy is too powerful for my body and bones to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm going to burst!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What can I do?
