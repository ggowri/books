  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence declared loudly, "Osborne, for all these years, I've been preparing to completely defeat you! I even intentionally suppressed my cultivation level, holding back from breaking through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I knew that if I simply broke through, with your talent, it would still be tough for me to truly overcome you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I needed to make my strength greater and have more trump cards to stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I choose to break through, it's because I feel absolutely confident in my victory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, the time has come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Lord Malevolence's body trembled violently, an even more terrifying power erupting from him. At the same time, his figure began to transform, his once lean form swelling like an inflated balloon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the most striking change was the emergence of two sharp horns from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming power radiated from those very horns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown as a sudden surge of pressure washed over him. His eyes were fixed on Lord Malevolence, whose figure was expanding, and the horns on top of his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What are those?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Lord Malevolence stopped transforming. Sensing Osborne's bewilderment, he reached up and touched the two horns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One horn glistened like an ice crystal, bright and transparent, while the other glowed with a purplish-red hue, crackling with electrical discharges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence let out a soft laugh. "These are the dragon horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More precisely, they're the horn of the Frost-enshrined Sacred Dragon and the horn of the Thunder-anointed Sacred Dragon! I shelled out a fortune to get them from the Cosmic Black Market. The process of fusing them was even more costly&mdash;I almost lost my life in the process!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it was all worth it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By fusing these dragon horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan, I've harnessed their awe-inspiring might! It encompasses both raw physical strength and elemental prowess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I may not measure up to the true members of the Sacred Dragon Clan, but it's more than sufficient to take you down! After all, the Sacred Dragon Clan is the apple of this cosmos' eye, the most powerful Apex Clan around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you ready to be utterly vanquished and wiped out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's eyes glinted with confidence and a fierce battle lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face grew solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dragon horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And not just one, but two of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence has fused with the dragon horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan, gaining their physical strength and elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this is his secret weapon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's truly terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne had never laid eyes on a member of the Sacred Dragon Clan, he'd heard endless stories about their legendary might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were on par with Lord Malevolence in terms of cultivation level, he wouldn't be daunted even if the latter were a genuine member of the Sacred Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the disparity in their cultivation levels was like an unbridgeable chasm&mdash;Lord Malevolence outclassed Osborne by a full six levels!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confronting such a vast gap was already a herculean task, and with Lord Malevolence's newly-acquired power, Osborne's sense of uncertainty grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he was resolute not to yield or show an ounce of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those dragon horns of the Sacred Dragon Clan are indeed formidable aces up your sleeve! But do you really think you can take me down with them? You're living in a fantasy! Come on, make your move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence gave a faint smile. "Very well! Let's see how you cope with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn on his forehead suddenly blazed with a blinding light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone present felt the temperature nosedive as if they'd been abruptly transported to a desolate frozen wasteland. The moisture in the air quickly solidified, turning into fluttering snowflakes and sharp ice shards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area around Lord Malevolence started to freeze at an alarming rate, turning the battlefield into a frigid prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne was hit by an intense cold wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if his blood was turning to ice in his veins, and his very soul and thoughts were about to be entombed in ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened drastically. He quickly summoned his Sacred Power to form a shield around himself, which offered a bit of respite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the seriousness of the situation still loomed large.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Lord Malevolence hadn't even launched his full-fledged attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn, freeze him!" Lord Malevolence roared, a malicious grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, a beam of light shot out from the dragon horn, wrapping Osborne in its icy embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the light hit him, Osborne's heart pounded with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that his defense formed by Sacred Power was gradually being frozen solid, cracking like delicate glass under the mounting pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an incredibly terrifying freezing force! It can even freeze my Sacred Power!" Osborne exclaimed, his eyes bulging with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Power was his lifeline, the only thing enabling him to narrow the colossal cultivation gap between himself and Lord Malevolence. If Lord Malevolence could nullify it, then his situation was dire indeed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and pushed his Sacred Power to its absolute limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can freeze my Sacred Power? You're delusional!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Sacred Power roared to life as he fought back against the frigid light emanating from the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn, determined not to let it paralyze him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence let out a sinister chuckle. "Impressive, I must say. You can actually withstand the freezing power of the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But for how long? The more you squander your Sacred Power, the closer you are to becoming a helpless prey in my hands. Once your energy is depleted, I'll crush you without the slightest effort!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Lord Malevolence's words, Osborne couldn't suppress a sneaky smirk inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yearned to tell the villain that this level of energy depletion was a piece of cake for him. He could endure for a year, a decade, or even a century without exhausting his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was he so confident? It was because he was the proud possessor of the Chaotic Spiritual Root!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, numerous shadowy roots started to snake out from Osborne's body. Only he could see them, and they glowed with a vivid green light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Chaotic Spiritual Root in action!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chaotic Spiritual Root latched onto the void and began to suck in energy non-stop. It replenished Osborne's Sacred Power, ensuring it remained at its optimal level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, a wave of relief washed over Osborne. He was deeply grateful that before he returned to Celestara Planet, Primordial had assisted him in merging with the fragment of the World Tree, endowing him with the Chaotic Spiritual Root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without it, his situation would be hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the current rate of energy consumption, he'd be completely drained in less than half an hour, leaving him an easy target for Lord Malevolence's attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed a torrent of his Sacred Power, colliding head-on with the bone-chilling force emanating from Lord Malevolence's Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two forces were locked in a brutal war of attrition, and the onlookers held their breaths, their eyes fixed on the intense spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contrast in the atmosphere was stark. On Lord Malevolence's side, there was an air of overconfidence. His minions were relaxed, fully convinced of their master's impending victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Osborne's allies were on pins and needles, their hearts pounding with anxiety about the battle's outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the minutes ticked by like hours, a subtle change came over Lord Malevolence's face. He had been so sure that Osborne's divine power would fade rapidly. In his mind, it was only a matter of time before Osborne's energy signature weakened, making Osborne an easy target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his utter shock, even after all this time, Osborne's energy signature remained as strong as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the energy drain was having no effect on him whatsoever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What sorcery is this?!" Lord Malevolence hissed under his breath, his forehead creased with a mix of disbelief and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence let out a disdainful snort and said, "Damn it! I underestimated you once more! Clearly, the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn alone won't be enough to take you down. Let's see how you fare against the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I simply won't accept that you can endure the combined might of both dragon horns!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words left his lips, the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn started to radiate an eerie, menacing glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared at the top of his lungs, "Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn! Reduce him to ashes!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
