  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Radiant Era Syndicate? What's going on? How did they end up in our Pioneers of Starlight's base?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's expression darkened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly asked, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lord! It seems like the Radiant Era Syndicate has taken over our base! This is our territory, yet they've hung up their sign! Those scoundrels! We bought this place; who do they think they are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's anger flared, and he was ready to charge forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grabbed his arm, urging him to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on! What's the deal with the Radiant Era Syndicate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren replied quickly, "My lord, the Radiant Era Syndicate is also a second-rate power in Apocalypse City! They have three Deity King warriors, which makes them slightly stronger than us. We're rivals, and our relationship is pretty hostile! We've clashed over Essence Crystals in the mines more than once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although the Lumina Guards always stepped in before things got too out of hand, we've definitely built up some bad blood. A year ago, when war broke out on the border, both our Pioneers of Starlight and the Radiant Era Syndicate accepted a mission from the Sanctum of Light to support the border against the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were even assigned to work together! But during that mission, we were surrounded by the Dark Deity Legion and nearly wiped out, with only about five thousand of us left, severely injured and captured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought the Radiant Era Syndicate suffered the same fate as us, but now it looks like they got lucky, managed to avoid the Legion, and came back to claim our base!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's fury was palpable as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, scanning the estate ahead. "You said the Radiant Era Syndicate is a second-rate power with only three Deity Kings? That doesn't sound right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren looked puzzled. "Huh? My lord, that's what I said!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pointed toward the estate. "There are at least 50 Deity King warriors inside! At least ten of them are mid-stage Deity Kings! They're all decked out in Radiant Era Syndicate uniforms, so they must belong to them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Darren was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't doubt Osborne's words; with his Satan's Eye, Osborne could see right through the estate and assess the situation inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell how many people were there, their strength, and even their primary powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne said there were over 50 Deity Kings, there were definitely more than that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could the Radiant Era Syndicate grow so fast? A year ago, they only had three Deity Kings, all at the early stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, in just a year, they've amassed 50 Deity Kings, including ten mid-stage ones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible!" Darren's brow furrowed tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, sharing Darren's skepticism. It was particularly strange to think that the Radiant Era Syndicate had been on the same mission with the Pioneers of Starlight a year ago, only for the Pioneers to be decimated by the Dark Deity Legion while the Radiant Era Syndicate seemingly thrived and took over their base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, a cold smile creeping onto his face, "There's definitely something fishy going on here! But we'll figure it out soon enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe we can catch a little fish in the process!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go reclaim our base!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne led the way forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached the foot of the mountain, their group of over a dozen didn't bother to hide their presence, quickly attracting the attention of the patrols surrounding the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could proceed, a group of about twenty individuals clad in Radiant Era Syndicate uniforms blocked their path. Their presence radiated strength, led by a peak Deity Overlord, while the others were all Celestial Deity warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just this patrol would qualify as a second-rate power in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in Apocalypse City, they were merely a second-rate patrol team among many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Apocalypse City was a far more formidable place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wild Flame City was just one of three major cities in East Zone Nine, of which there were about thirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conversely, Apocalypse City was one of the top ten main cities in the West Zone, home to a staggering portion of the Human Community&mdash;over a trillion individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every major city there boasted a population in the hundreds of billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such an impressive backdrop, the strength of even a second-rate organization in Apocalypse City should not be taken lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Who are you?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Radiant Era Syndicate's base. Unauthorized personnel are not permitted here! Please leave at once!" the Radiant Era Syndicate patrol barked at Osborne and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren scoffed, a scowl on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of nonsense is this? This isn't your precious Radiant Era Syndicate's base! This is the Pioneers of Starlight's territory! I'm Darren of the Pioneers of Starlight, and I'm back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You Radiant Era Syndicate folks need to get the hell out of here&mdash;now! Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the faces of the patrol shifted dramatically, surprise and tension palpable among them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
