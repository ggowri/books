  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Solar Realm! Activate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Marlon unleashed the Solar Realm, determined not to give Osborne a second to recover. Despite his bravado about defeating Osborne even at his peak, Marlon had no intention of allowing Osborne that opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon had been continuously calculating when Osborne could use the Light of Redemption again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twelve minutes remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twelve minutes&mdash;plenty of time to finish you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon sneered as the Solar Realm enveloped the entire arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above Osborne, ten blazing solar orbs appeared, radiating intense heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, a searing power washed over Osborne, forcing him to maintain his martial art aura to withstand the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, your time in the Honor Quest Ceremony has been impressive, but </span><span>ultimately, you'll be defeated by me and become nothing more than a stepping stone for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time for you to lose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Solar Descent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Marlon directed one of the radiant sun orbs to crash down upon Osborne. It descended like a meteor, its approach sending waves of pain through Osborne's body even before impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force made his martial art aura fluctuate violently, threatening to break apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of grave concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a powerful attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, focusing all his strength as he prepared to counter the falling sun orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact reverberated through the arena as Osborne's energy collided with the descending orb, shattering it into a brilliant explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even in victory, a wave of scorching energy surged into Osborne's body, forcing a grunt of pain from his lips as his skin flushed a deep crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burning force clawed at him, igniting every nerve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get off me!" Osborne roared, struggling to expel the searing energy from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he charged toward Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I have to take the initiative!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's Solar Realm was formidable, which was already at Level Three, and while Osborne could theoretically shatter it, doing so would drain far too much of his limited strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At thirty percent of his peak, he couldn't afford that kind of waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's plan was simple. He needed to land a solid hit on Marlon. If Osborne could connect and unleash his Explosive Force, he was confident he could inflict serious damage, causing the Solar Realm to collapse in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marlon wasn't about to make it easy. He wasn't foolish; he knew how dangerous Osborne's attacks could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when he saw Osborne barreling toward him, he simply smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Solar Fusion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Marlon vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in alarm as he looked up, only to see Marlon merging with one of the solar orbs high above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he looked like the sun itself, looming down at Osborne with a chilling smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you can't defeat me! In my Solar Realm, all your tricks are meaningless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time for you to concede!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Solar Burst!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, all the solar orbs exploded with blinding light, unleashing a torrent of devastating solar beams that rained down like a storm of deadly swords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer intensity of the onslaught was overwhelming, leaving Osborne with nowhere to hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened as he frantically defended himself with his Martial Art Aura, while unleashing a barrage of punches. With his formidable power, he attempted to </span><span>shatter the endless solar swords in the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the solar swords seemed inexhaustible, crashing down with terrifying might. Osborne was pushed back, step by step, as his strength rapidly drained away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blinding flash, Osborne was swamped by an endless sea of solar swords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching from below, the crowd was awash in a storm of light, unable to discern Osborne's form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless onslaught sent tremors through the arena, threatening to crumble the very foundations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of the solar swords left many in shock, convinced that they themselves couldn't withstand even one strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Osborne faced an endless, unrelenting assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectating members of the Augustine family stood up, worry etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems he'll never make it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This attack is too fearsome. Not even a true Class S Supreme Overlord could not block such an assault without breaking Marlon's Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We always thought Marlon claiming a spot in the Godson Rankings was just hot air, but now it's clear it's the truth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marlon is truly formidable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is on the verge of defeat!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
