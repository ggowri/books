  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eight spatial clones possessed nearly the same combat prowess as he did, wielding the power of space elemental essence and Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With eight clones, a thousand Dark Undeads equivalent to mid-</span><span>stage</span><span> Deity Overlords, and the formidable Osborne himself wielding the Supreme Malevolence Sword, their combined strength was terrifying. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No </span><span>way the injured Deathborn King could withstand such an onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vitality, no matter how robust, couldn't save him now. His body was utterly torn apart and crushed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, Deathborn King was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe I actually </span><span>killed</span><span> Deathborn King!" Osborne murmured to himself, a sense of disbelief washing over him as the King's body exploded into a shower of dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Deity King they were talking about!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between a Deity Overlord and a Deity King was immense, like a chasm that couldn't be crossed. Even a super genius couldn't hope to defeat a Deity King while still at the peak of Deity Overlord status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weakest Deity King could annihilate a peak Deity Overlord with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, who had just barely broken through to Deity Overlord, managing to slay one of their kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Angelo had played a part, but Osborne felt confident he could have done it alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I've really gotten this strong!" he whispered, and a wave of exhilaration coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no time for celebration. As Deathborn King's life force finally flickered out, it left behind a dense, crimson mist of death scent swirling in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was... death scent liquid!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath quickened at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within him began to tremble with anticipation, and its roots stretched out hungrily toward the death scent liquid, eager to absorb it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Lotus consumed the liquid, the long-dormant flowers began to show signs of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its vitality surged, and its petals opened one by one, inching closer to full restoration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he had decided to leave Blue Planet for Celestara, only to be ambushed by the God of Time and accidentally trapped in deep space, it felt like ages had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was a strange concept in that place, so he had no idea how long he had been trapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after more than three months since escaping deep space and finally reaching Celestara, he was on the verge of fully restoring the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those three long months, the Lotus had not completely revived, leaving him without his immortality. In a world as perilous as Celestara, Osborne had to tread carefully, always on guard against the slightest misstep that could lead to his demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the Lotus regaining its strength, he would finally reclaim his immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Dimensional Microcosm, which had been cocooned within the petals of the Lotus, was about to see the light of day once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside that microcosm were his </span><span>Grandpa </span><span>Sebastian, his sister</span><span>s </span><span>Anastasia</span><span> and </span><span>Zoe, Bryce and Kendra, the God of Star, Divine Shadow, Mila, and the members of the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne had passed through the dimensional portal from Blue Planet to Celestara, he had left them all in the Dimensional Microcosm, planning to let them out once he arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because of the withering of the Lotus, flowers had trapped them inside, preventing him from entering and them from escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been far too long since he had seen them. Now, finally, that was about to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how they're doing right now! I hope everything's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a mix of anticipation and anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity absorbed all the death scent liquid and fully restored itself, and its once withered petals unfolded anew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Dimensional Microcosm, which had been wrapped tightly by the Lotus, became visible again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne re-established his connection with Dimensional Microcosm, and at that moment, he knew he could finally enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a surge of excitement, Osborne didn't hesitate for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated Dimensional Microcosm, leaving a clone behind to scout outside, and in the blink of an eye, he vanished into the microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afte</span><span>r a long time</span><span>, Osborne stepped </span><span>into the </span><span>Dimensional Microcosm</span><span> again</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a rough small world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This space had originally been a temporary sanctuary, but as he walked in, he noticed that the environment had transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thick fog filled the air, swirling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it felt like his pores opened wide, flooding his body with a wave of euphoric energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This mist... Is it pure celestial energy? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>No, wait! It's the energy of Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span><span> Why is </span><span>its energy</span><span> full of the </span><span>Dimensional Microcosm? The density</span><span> of energy</span><span> here is even greater than </span><span>that of </span><span>Divine Peak Nine</span><span>! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced, realizing that this place was a miraculous cultivation ground. The intensity of the energy was so rich that even a single breath could </span><span>improve</span><span> one's strength and </span><span>level</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a group of figures rushed toward him, closing the distance quickly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
