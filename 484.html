  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Clarissa's gentle coaxing, the little girl's emotions finally began to settle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had learned that her name was Autumn Fisher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn had once been embraced by a loving family with a caring brother and parents. Though their income was modest, it was sufficient for their needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, tragedy struck. Autumn's father fell into the clutches of addiction, transforming him into a shadow of his former self. He spent every penny they had on drugs from the Hummingbird Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their money ran out, he started selling off their possessions. Homes, cars&mdash;nothing was sacred. Desperate, he even took out a usurious loan from the Hummingbird Gang to feed his habit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Autumn's once-happy family was shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father, consumed by his addiction, became a mere shell of a man. When the Hummingbird Gang came knocking for their dues, he couldn't pay. They showed him no mercy, beating him to death right before Autumn and her brother, Luke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the nightmare didn't end there. Even in death, her father's debts bound the family. The Hummingbird Gang coerced Autumn's mother into prostitution to settle the debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she resisted, they threatened her children's lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To shield her son and daughter, she surrendered, following the gang to their dens to trade her body for their safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had hoped that once the debt was repaid, the gang would release her children. But she had underestimated their cruelty. They kidnapped Luke, broke his limbs, and turned him into a beggar on the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each day, if he failed to meet his quota, he would be denied food and beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within two weeks, Luke succumbed to the relentless abuse, beaten to death for his inability to comply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn watched in horror as Luke was killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, her mother met a similar fate, dying at the hands of a client.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Autumn was a girl, they didn't break her to make her a beggar, but it didn't mean mercy. They were biding their time, waiting until she was old enough to exploit her in a far more sinister way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, for now, Autumn was made to sell flowers on the streets, a seemingly kinder fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't meet her quota, she faced beatings and starvation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her endearing looks, Autumn usually managed to sell enough, but today was different. A fall had soiled her flowers, leaving her with no sales, so she was in such a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why the Hummingbird Gang had beaten her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne and Clarissa hadn't found her, her future would have been bleak. Even if she survived, the gang would have forced her into prostitution as she grew older.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she aged, they might even have harvested her organs to sell to the highest bidder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life was destined for tragedy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Autumn's story, Osborne and Clarissa were filled with rage, their faces pale with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hummingbird Gang was the devil incarnate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn's plight was not unique. Countless families had suffered at their hands, dying in agony and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes were icy with intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how many gangs like the Hummingbird Gang plagued </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, but he was determined to eradicate each one he found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't save the world, but he would save </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a vow in his heart and murder in his eyes, Osborne was resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa held Autumn close, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn, just eight years old, had experienced horrors akin to hell itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay! It's okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heart full of sorrow, Clarissa said, "It's over now! No one will ever hurt you again. Tell me, what's your wish? Where would you like to go? I'll make it happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn hesitated, her eyes downcast, then whispered, "My mom, dad, and brother... they're all gone. I have no home. I want to go to an orphanage if that's okay. I heard they'll take care of us there and teach us things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you take me there? I want to be like the children in the orphanage, where I can eat every day and no one will hit me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished, her eyes brimming with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart ached at her wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had also grown up in an orphanage, a place he had once despised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that his childhood was miserable enough as he grew up in an orphanage. He hated the orphanage and wanted to escape from it. He envied those with families and homes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he realized his childhood was not as tragic as he had thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place he had once hated was the sanctuary Autumn longed for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she wanted was to be safe, to have enough to eat, and to be free from violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those demons!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could no longer contain his fury. Before, he had only incapacitated the Hummingbird Gang members, but now, he knew he had been too lenient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every single one of the Hummingbird Gang is a devil. None of them deserve to live. They all must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne conjured a sea of flames that rained down upon the gang members.</span></p><div class="pagination">
