  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face twisted into an expression of seriousness as she considered the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion smirked. "Are you satisfied with my betrothal gift, Ms. Radcliffe?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can assert that only the Lark family is willing to present a level two ancient magic weapon as a betrothal gift for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While others pursue betrothal discussions with Sir Radcliffe, I respect your wishes and brought the betrothal gift directly to you. Hope you'll agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual gesture, Orion invited Clarissa to inspect the statue like a charming gentleman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's demeanor remained ice-cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was curious about the statue named the Sacred Sorceress, wanting to understand why it resembled her so much and why its appearance seemed to awaken something within her body as if something was stirring awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa faintly felt a strong connection to the statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the thought that this statue was Orion's betrothal gift for her, Clarissa felt disgusted, forcefully suppressing her curiosity and taking a few steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it's a level two ancient magic weapon, what of it? I have no interest in it. Take it back! I will not marry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa finished speaking and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's confident expression immediately disappeared, his gaze turning somewhat icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Radcliffe, do you perhaps think my betrothal gift is not enough? Or do you think I am out of your league?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa calmly replied, "It's neither. I simply don't like you and have no intention of marrying you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Furthermore, I already have a boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprised, Donna attempted to stop Clarissa, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You already have a boyfriend? But didn't Apollo just die two days ago? Who is he? Are you deceiving me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa hesitated, unsure whether to reveal Osborne's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her silence, Orion smirked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like you are truly deceiving me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a cold voice sounded from outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa isn't lying to you. She does indeed have a boyfriend, and her boyfriend is me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's lovely face immediately lit up as she swiftly looked towards the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coldness melted from Clarissa's face, replaced by a radiant smile, as she quickly ran a few steps and stood in front of Osborne, looking up at him with joy and happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and reached out to touch Clarissa's lovely face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry for the delay. Are you okay, Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, Clarissa shook her head vigorously, hugging Osborne's arm tightly and leaning against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, witnessing their intimate actions, couldn't contain his anger, losing his elegant gentlemanly facade and even appearing somewhat sinister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion glared at Osborne, asking coldly, "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne returned the gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Orion? The Lark family's heir? Humph! Take your things and leave. Clarissa is my girlfriend. Don't ever think about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Orion calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, saying, "Your name is Osborne? I never heard of you! You claim Ms. Radcliffe as your girlfriend? Ha, what are you? A nobody like you thinks you're worthy of being with Ms. Radcliffe?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do the Radcliffe family approve of you both being together?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Radcliffe family agrees, I will leave without a fuss. But unfortunately, you two are probably just putting on an act!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he looked down on Osborne with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe that Clarissa would ever be interested in Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face flushed with anger, and though she seemed on the verge of saying something, she held her tongue, realizing that Orion had a point, even if it was a difficult one to admit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Radcliffe family would never approve of her being with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, remained composed and smirked. "You think we're just putting on a show?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, brimming with confidence, retorted, "Aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chuckle, Osborne suddenly turned and placed his hands on Clarissa's shoulders, locking eyes with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was taken aback, her cheeks burning as she met Osborne's intense gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what... what are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile widened, and he leaned in, whispering, "Clarissa, I want to kiss you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed an even deeper red. "There... there are people watching."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew earnest. "That's exactly why I want to kiss you! From now on, I want everyone to know that I'm your boyfriend. No matter how dangerous it is or how many people try to keep us apart, I'm not backing down. I'm facing this head-on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touched, she bit her lip and gazed at Osborne with a tenderness that seemed almost palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded vigorously. "Osborne, let's face it together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for Osborne to respond, Clarissa stood on her tiptoes and pressed her lips against his.</span></p><div class="pagination">
