Their faces flushed with embarrassment as they wished they could disappear into the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Who exactly is Osborne? What identity does he possess?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Os</span><span>... Osborne..." Cillian stammered, struggling to find his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "You're wondering about my identity, aren't you? I assure you. I'm not lying. My name is indeed Osborne! I'm the head of the Augustine family in </span><span>Newport City and the </span><span>current </span><span>owner of the Draco Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As those words sank in, Cillian and the others' eyes went wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Wait, Osborne is the head of the Augustine family and the Draco Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That means he is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Godfather!" They </span><span>gasped, their voices tinged with awe and incredulity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were merely from a wealthy family, completely out of their depth when it came to the likes of the Augustine family</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard rumors that the former Godfather of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> had stepped back, but they had no idea who had taken his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, they knew Osborne was the new Godfather of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian and his siblings were utterly stunned, their minds racing to comprehend the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne paid them little mind, his focus shifting back to the task at hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you need help from the Augustine family in Newport City, feel free to let me know later. But for now, I need you to wait here. I'll handle this emerging Beast Tide first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand, commanding, "Go! Eliminate all evolved Ferocious Beasts! Wipe out every last Dark Exotic Beast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" came the thunderous reply from the Blood Demon members</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With </span><span>high</span><span> speed and precision, the four thousand eight hundred Blood Demon warriors swiftly divided into </span><span>10</span><span> combat squadrons. Except for the elite Blood Demon Vanguard, a hundred strong, each squad </span><span>had</span><span> over 500 </span><span>soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They dispersed rapidly, encircling a sprawling expanse of forest that stretched over dozens of miles, partitioning it into </span><span>10</span><span> strategic sectors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, they lunged into the dense woods from every direction, targeting the swarm of Ferocious Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cacophony of terrible roars erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless Ferocious Beasts surged forth, hurtling towards the Blood Demon with rabid ferocity, a horde that included numerous Class A, AA, and even AAA Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their numbers were </span><span>huge</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the beasts' ranks paled in comparison to the Blood Demons' </span><span>prowess, sheer numbers </span><span>overwhelmed</span><span>. Each squad found themselves besieged by tens of thousands of ravening beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon warriors unleashed their full firepower, hewing and cutting</span><span>. However, inexplicably, the beasts waged on, their numbers never dwindling, practically ballooning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mad with bloodlust, the beasts surged onward, heedless of death, launching themselves in suicidal frenzies against the Blood Demon ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock froze Cillian and his trio like statues. Their eyes riveted on the battle unfolding like a nightmare, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could not help his own deepening frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Dark Exotic Beasts</span><span> are </span><span>smart!
