  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was also quite surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> fangs can only merge with the Warfare Scythe and cannot integrate into the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow. Otherwise, the traits of </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> fangs would remain unused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne uses the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow more often.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's view, the biggest advantage of </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> fangs is their sharpness, capable of cutting through anything. From now on, no matter how strong his opponent's defense is, he will be able to break through it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll </span><span>keep</span><span> this as my trump card!" he said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked Primordial, "How do I infuse </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> venom into the Warfare Scythe?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said calmly, "That's not your concern. Just leave it to the Warfare Ancient Tree! That's what he's specialized in! In the future, if you find any Ultimate forging materials, you can hand them over to the Warfare Ancient Tree. He can help integrate them into the Sacred Artifact, upgrade it faster, enhance its power, and even grant it new abilities."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, absorbed </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> venom into his body, and handed it over to the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The </span><span>Warfare Ancient Tree immediately got to work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under its control, </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> fangs slowly merged with the Warfare Scythe. At the moment of fusion, Osborne felt the Warfare Scythe had changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The previous Warfare Scythe was only about three feet long, shorter than most swords or battle blades. But after merging with </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> fangs, the Warfare Scythe became </span><span>bigger</span><span> and more menacing than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its length exceeded six feet, and compared to the Goddess of Grain's scythe, its appearance had completely transformed, resembling a double-edged reaper's scythe. The razor-sharp blade gleamed with a black light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A chilling aura </span><span>radiated</span><span> from the Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What shocked Osborne even more was that the Warfare Scythe had </span><span>leveled up</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally a low-grade Sacred Artifact, the Warfare Scythe directly advanced a level after merging with </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> fangs, becoming a mid-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "This is a good thing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed. The </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow hadn't upgraded yet, but unexpectedly, the Warfare Scythe upgraded first, surpassing the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow in power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems I need to find some good stuff to merge into the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow to help it upgrade quickly! Relying solely on the Warfare Ancient Tree is too slow! </span><span>Before breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness, I must upgrade the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow to a mid-grade Sacred Artifact. Otherwise, the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow will soon become insufficient!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, a menacing scythe over six feet long appeared in Osborne's hand. Completely pitch-black, it was covered with dense purple patterns that shimmered. The slightly curved sharp blade left Osborne very satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I need to find something to test its power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a thought, Osborne instantly condensed the Eclipse War Armor using Sacred Power. It was the strongest defensive armor his Sacred Power could create.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his current Sacred Power strength, the fully unleashed Eclipse War Armor had a defense strong enough to leave most opponents of his level in despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne held the Warfare Scythe and gave it a gentle swing. The scythe sliced through the Eclipse War Armor from top to bottom, as if cutting through a thin sheet of paper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, the Eclipse War Armor was split in half down the middle, completely destroyed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a sharp breath. Although he already knew that the Warfare Scythe, fused with </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> poison, would become incredibly sharp with extraordinary armor-piercing ability, he was still startled after actually testing it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fully unleashed Eclipse War Armor was as fragile as paper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's even scarier is that he didn't even use any force just now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Scythe, relying solely on its own power and sharpness, effortlessly sliced through the Eclipse War Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I'll try a stronger defense!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne directly took out the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Warfare Shield is only a mid-grade Sacred Artifact, its defense rivals most top-grade Defensive Sacred Artifacts. With Osborne's strength activating the Warfare Shield's power, its defense is far superior to the Eclipse War Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thanks to the Warfare Shield, Osborne made up for his weakness in defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne unleashed his Sacred Power wildly, fully activating the Warfare Shield. The phantom of the Warfare Ancient Tree on the shield immediately began to emit light, followed by a layer of gray mist that completely enveloped Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the Warfare Mist!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Mist possesses extremely strong defensive power. Osborne believes that under Empyrean Sacredness, no one should be able to easily break through his Warfare Mist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he swung the Warfare Scythe again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sharp scythe sliced through the Warfare Mist, instantly cutting it open and leaving a mark. Although the mark quickly healed, it was indeed cut through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at the Warfare Scythe in his hand in disbelief, somewhat startled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This breaking power is insane! The Warfare Mist unleashed by the Warfare Shield can't even block this scythe at all? I refuse to believe there's nothing that can stop you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he quickly put away the Ascending Sacred Sanctum again, his face full of helplessness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the Ascending Sacred Sanctum requires a large amount of Sacred Crystal to unleash powerful defenses, and Osborne has no Sacred Crystal left!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All his Sacred Crystals were gambled away at the casino. Now, he's broke and can only rely on his own strength to drive the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in that case, the defense of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum is not even as good as the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, don't even bother trying!" Primordial said indifferently. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have no idea how terrifying the fangs of the </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> are! They can even pierce through the barriers of worlds! Like I said, there's nothing in this cosmos that can withstand the bite of the </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span>-not even your Ascending Sacred Sanctum!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a </span><span>deep</span><span> breath and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, he thought Primordial might be bluffing, but now he believes him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fangs of the </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> are truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After merging with the Warfare Scythe, the fangs of the </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> turned his Warfare Scythe into an incredibly terrifying Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The only pity is that the Warfare Scythe's terrifying armor-piercing ability can only be used in close combat! Its sharpness only works when the Warfare Scythe makes contact. If this sharpness could be utilized in ranged attacks, you'd be invincible!" Primordial said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial rolled his eyes, "Kid, still not satisfied? If it had such terrifying armor-piercing ability even in ranged attacks, it wouldn't just be a Sacred Artifact! Even the top-tier Sacred Artifacts can't be that powerful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, put away the Warfare Scythe and Warfare Shield, and hung them on the Warfare Ancient Tree, letting the Warfare Ancient Tree continue nurturing them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said to the Warfare Ancient Tree, "Next, focus most of your power on nurturing the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow! Upgrade the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow to a mid-grade Sacred Artifact as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright," Warfare Ancient Tree responded calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the next two days, Osborne, having run out of Sacred Crystals, didn't wander around and just focused on cultivating in the inn. Everything was peaceful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the third day, he finally left the inn and arrived at </span><span>Zephyrville's</span><span> translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! We should head to Crescentia! The zone duel will be held in Crescentia!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
