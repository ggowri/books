  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my chance to change my fate. I'd rather die in glory than live in shame," Osborne muttered as he entered the general store and collected what he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A short while later, with determination on his face, he headed back to Caldwell Tower under the guise of gathering his things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he reached the tower, a group of familiar faces blocked him from entering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well look who</span><span>'</span><span>s back! Why are you here?</span><span>"</span><span> Evelyn hissed as she pushed her way to the front of the crowd. </span><span>"</span><span>If you</span><span>'</span><span>re after your belongings, you should know they</span><span>'</span><span>ve already been discarded. I handled that myself. Don't bother going in; you might steal something! Leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at him as the other Caldwells gathered behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne</span><span>'</span><span>s face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn never showed him kindness during his three years with the Caldwells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She constantly insulted him and pushed Ophelia to divorce him. And now, apparently, she had discarded his possessions as if they were garbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Osborne might have endured the humiliation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered and shoved Evelyn aside, plowing through a sea of Caldwells and storming into the tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless fool!</span><span>"</span><span> Evelyn snapped. </span><span>"</span><span>How dare you push me? There</span><span>'</span><span>s nothing for you here! Get lost, or you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raced ahead of him and blocked his path. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "Nothing for me? I have rights to certain assets. Just give me a cool hundred million from the Caldwell family fortune, and I'll leave. Otherwise, I'm not going anywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's high demand was intentional. He knew the Caldwells wouldn't agree. He aimed high to leave room for bargaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Caldwell family was stunned. All at once, they burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah! Has this loser gone mad?" one shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Ophelia's divorce scrambled his brain. He's lost his damn mind," another said, cackling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn snapped. "Are you insane? Demanding a hundred million from the Caldwell family? Who do you think you are? I knew you were after my family</span><span>'</span><span>s money. I should have ended you sooner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched with quiet satisfaction as Evelyn</span><span>'</span><span>s face contorted with rage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guards!" she screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, five bodyguards surrounded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beat him senseless,</span><span>"</span><span> Evelyn ordered, eyes blazing. </span><span>"</span><span>I'll take responsibility if he dies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards smiled coldly and descended on Osborne, swinging their fists wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold glint flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past three years, whenever Evelyn was displeased with him, she'd have the bodyguards beat him without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Evelyn was Ophelia's stepmother, he had to endure it&mdash;and because of it, the Caldwell family thought him all the weaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If only they knew. If it weren</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">t for my protecting Ophelia in secret, rival families would</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ve taken her out long ago, leaving her no chance to inherit the Caldwell fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't going to take it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His left pupil split into two. The Eye of Satan had activated, triggered by his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything around him slowed to a crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne moved swiftly, dodging a punch and landing an uppercut on a bodyguard's chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years of frustration came out in that punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard's jaw shattered as he fell, sending blood and teeth skittering across the cold marble floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When another slow-motion punch came at Osborne, he dodged it with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bam! Bam! Bam!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, like a raging lion, defeated all five bodyguards in under ten seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell over the scene. The Caldwell family stared on in shock and fear, jaws agape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Looks like I won</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">t need what I purchased from the general store&mdash;not yet, at least. Five bodyguards down in seconds. Who</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s the loser now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He</span><span>'</span><span>s a monster!" one Caldwell cried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, you..." Evelyn trembled, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold gaze fixed on her. He knew the bodyguards were just pawns. Evelyn was the real culprit. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a steely expression, Osborne stepped closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn's eyes widened in terror. "You bastard, what are you going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I going to do?</span><span>"</span><span> Osborne asked, a wry smile crawling across his face. </span><span>"</span><span>I</span><span>'</span><span>m going to collect what</span><span>'</span><span>s mine."</span></p><div class="pagination">
