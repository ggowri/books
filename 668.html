  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in Jalmar, Matthew also noticed the changes on the scoreboard. However, he handled it better than Vincent. He let out a long sigh and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My prediction was indeed correct!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne is truly capable of creating miracles! He is undoubtedly my greatest opponent! Killing five Class AAA fighters in one go is quite a feat. How did he manage to do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew pondered hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how much he thought, he couldn't comprehend how Osborne, with the support behind him, could achieve so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems like he must have found a formidable reinforcement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to work harder! The attacks from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> have slowed down during this period. It seems their goal is not really to conquer </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> entirely. They are only interested in rare metal mines!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This war may end at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to make a move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After murmuring to himself, Matthew spoke up, "Notify all Class AA members and above to gather for a meeting. It's time for us to counterattack! We need to gain as many points as possible; otherwise, it will be too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Halyan, Emma's face froze, her small slightly agape, as she stared at the leaderboard for a full five minutes, forgetting to blink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Augustine, are you okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a gap of more than 2,000 points. Ms. Augustine, don't be upset. If we work harder, we will definitely catch up! Ms. Augustine, you are the most talented among the younger generation of the Augustine family. You will definitely catch up and surpass him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone tried to console her, and Emma snapped out of her daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled faintly. "I'm not upset. I just find it incredible! In the past ten days, his points didn't increase at all. I thought he had given up. It turns out he was accumulating strength. And now, he shocked me with a single move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now it's getting more interesting! Others might think that he got reinforcements to kill five Class AAA fighters, but I think he might have achieved it on his own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, everyone wore a shocked expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible! His strength is far inferior to yours, Ms. Augustine. How could he possibly kill five Class AAA fighters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma smiled and said, "At the Godfather's birthday party, no one believed that he could turn the situation around and defeat the Godson from </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>. In the end, he defeated four Godsons from </span><span>Yalynch</span><span> in succession and created a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is someone skilled at creating miracles. Nothing is impossible for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I won't give up easily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get ready. It's time for us to counterattack and show our strength! I, Emma, </span><span>won't lose to anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her words, Emma stood up and stretched lazily, displaying her perfect body curves. Her ample bosom seemed like two balls that were about to burst out of her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Godfather asked me to awaken the Satan's Eye, but no man can capture my attention!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can maintain your </span><span>first place</span><span> position...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Having you help me awaken the Satan's Eye might be a good choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma mumbled to herself, and her face suddenly blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, at the headquarters of Draco Group, Owen and Lance looked at each other, their faces gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did Osborne manage that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne ascending to the top of the scoreboard, Lance once again found himself in last place. However, he no longer cared because he had given up on competing a few days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that he couldn't possibly make it into the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Owen sent someone over and proposed cooperation. He also promised Lance numerous benefits. After some hesitation, Lance agreed to Owen's proposal and joined Owen's team directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Lance and his people joining, Owen's team instantly grew stronger. In these few days of catching up, they finally got rid of the embarrassment of negative points and closed the gap with Vincent, Matthew, and Emma, with only a few hundred points separating them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Owen anticipated catching up to the top three on the scoreboard, Osborne's sudden rise to first place left him dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did he fail to catch up to the top three, but he even dropped to fifth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Owen not be embarrassed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn Osborne, he must be cheating! Or maybe he found a powerful ally and used cunning tricks to kill five Class AAA fighters from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will definitely go after him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what if he's temporarily in first place? Next, he will become the primary target of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' attacks. He might even die on the battlefield, and his position on the scoreboard will soon be surpassed by us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen gritted his teeth and spoke, his face grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lance, inform your people that we'll do another counterattack! This time, we're not aiming to recapture the rare metal mining area. Our goal is to kill the enemies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can't even secure a spot in the top three together, both of us will be a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's face turned serious as he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I will make the arrangements!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
