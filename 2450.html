  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The grand and majestic voice spread to every corner of the Abyssal Planet. Contestants, no matter where they were, could hear it clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This feat alone already proved the person's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Zone duel is finally over! Looks like support from the Glorious Divine Kingdom has arrived! This person is probably at least an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cultivation levels of an Empyrean Sacredness warrior are divided into primary, mid, advanced, Lesser Perfection, and Great Perfection. After Great Perfection, there is a half-step cultivation level called Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cultivation level after Empyrean Sacredness is called Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness is extremely difficult. At least on Racial Convergence Planet, Osborne had hardly heard of anyone succeeding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And those who have reached Empyrean Sacredness and are just a step away from breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness are considered to have reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, the leaders of the three Top-tier Powers on Racial Convergence Planet have all surpassed Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, everyone cares about their reputation. Although they have only reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, they dislike others mentioning this and prefer to be addressed as Imperial Lords.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One example is Frederick Augustine, the ruler of Glorious Divine Kingdom and Osborne's father in his previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Any smart person would only address him as Emperor Frederick or Glorious Divine Emperor!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, the ruler of Evernight Court, Anthony Reynolds, is also called Emperor Anthony or Emperor Evernight. The president of Phantom Commerce Guild, Russell, is referred to as Emperor Russell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, their cultivation level is only Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors on the entire Racial Convergence Planet are not many.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from the three major Top-tier Powers, only the most formidable First-rate Powers have Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, such as Fairy Moon Sect, Brenda's sect, Skyearth Dominion, as well as the equally renowned Golden Dragon Society and Purple Thunder Gang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are considered potential candidates to become the fourth Top-tier Power on Racial Convergence Planet because their sects all have Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana of Fairy Moon Sect is one of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the speaker has at least broken through to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Racial Convergence Planet, those who have reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection are already top warriors. In any faction, they hold absolute high-ranking positions with supreme authority.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! We should gather now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy also stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their expressions were somewhat dazed. This zone duel had too many unexpected events, and they gained too much. Now, it was finally over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They calculated the time and realized it was actually only the eighth day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The zone duel ended two days earlier than expected, but they had anticipated this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, due to the appearance of the Magma Devourer, most contestants had been running for their lives, chased by various Native Creatures of the Abyssal Planet. The number of dead contestants likely exceeded a hundred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Valentino, the top favorite to win the zone duel, was dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With such an accident, it was normal for the zone duel to end early.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy followed Osborne toward the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda, still in the glacier area, suddenly stopped in her tracks upon hearing the sound, feeling excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has the Zone duel ended early?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's fine! The Ice Beetles in the glacier area have all disappeared for some reason! During this time, I haven't found a single Ice Beetle, and my gains have decreased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ending early works too! This way, my championship is even more secure!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda showed a radiant smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to look at the crowd behind her and said, "Everyone, the support from Glorious Divine Kingdom has arrived! We're all safe now. Thank you all for your cooperation during this time! It's our mutual help that allowed us to survive and gain so much..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, it's time for us to regroup!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they heard her words, many people immediately looked at her with admiration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, we should be the ones thanking you for helping us! If it weren't for you showing up in time and bringing us together, we might have died days ago!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've never admired anyone at the same cultivation level as me, but now I admire you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right, I admire you too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We want to congratulate you in advance on winning the championship! In Eastern Zone 3, you are the strongest under the Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right, congratulations on winning the championship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But your championship includes our efforts, and we feel honored too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up! Let's gather! I can't wait to see Brenda become the champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A team of over 800 people started heading back to the Cosmic Translocator. They all believed Brenda had the championship secured, with no one able to compete with her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, her gains over the past few days were enormous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She used the Ice Scepter to kill a large number of Ice Beetles and took half of the loot for herself. If she exchanged all the Ice Beetles for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, it might exceed a billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda, full of confidence, quickened her pace to return.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, in the volcanic area, Gerald greeted a figure in front of him with a bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Ian Augustine, hello!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"General Ian Augustine, hello!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the judges respectfully bowed and greeted, as the visitor was a three-star general of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior, Ian Augustine!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is also a member of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Ian is only a member of the branch bloodline, he still carries the Royal Family's lineage. His status is naturally higher than others, so they have to respect him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved casually, his expression somewhat arrogant, and said indifferently, "Hello! Tell me, what's going on here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where is the Magma Devourer? After the Emperor learned about the situation on Abyssal Planet, he took it very seriously and immediately sent me with reinforcements. However, since the Cosmic Translocator was destroyed, I could only teleport to the nearest resource-bearing planet and then traverse the starry sky to get here, so it took me six days to arrive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why can't I sense the presence of the Magma Devourer?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian looked at Gerald in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald frowned and replied, "General Ian Augustine, the Magma Devourer has been killed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was surprised upon hearing this and looked at Gerald.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It has been killed? Gerald, well done! Have your abilities improved again? That Magma Devourer is a Silicon-based Lifeform. Its body is incredibly terrifying! Its cultivation level was almost at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even I would find it hard to kill it alone! And you managed to kill it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're amazing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian's praise made Gerald a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly explained, "General Ian Augustine, the Magma Devourer wasn't killed by me! Although I injured it, I absolutely didn't have the strength to kill it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Magma Devourer was killed by another creature!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, until now, I still don't know what creature killed the Magma Devourer! Before you arrived, I was leading an investigation, but we haven't found any clues."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald lowered his head in shame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was stunned. "It was another creature that killed the Magma Devourer? You don't know who? Could there really be a creature stronger than the Magma Devourer on Abyssal Planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's interesting."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He laughed, "Perfect, repairing the Cosmic Translocator will take some time anyway. Let me thoroughly explore this Abyssal Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The resources on this Abyssal Planet seem far richer than I initially estimated!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Ian had already disappeared.</span></p><div class="pagination">
