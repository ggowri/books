  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A counterattack on the Deschanel Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of it struck like a thunderbolt among the high-ranking members of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Osborne in stunned silence, exchanging uncertain glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne allowed the moment to simmer, taking his time to survey the more than a hundred deities of the Augustine family gathered before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These individuals were the most gifted of the clan, thus achieving divinity at an impressive pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were many familiar faces to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent and Owen from the main bloodline had ascended to godhood, as had Owen's younger sister, Evelynn. They once had their differences with Osborne, but they had long since acknowledged his leadership. With their remarkable talents, it was no surprise they had reached this level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also prodigies from the branch bloodlines who had become deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's sister Kendra now had a Level Five Divine Body, her potential rivaling Bryce's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Osborne's glance, she playfully stuck out her tongue, a mischievous expression on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her divine status, she still seemed like a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, nodding at her before continuing to assess the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena, too, had become a deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "It's a pity no one from the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> branch has ascended yet. But Nathan, Yulissa, and Queenie are not far behind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Observing the numerous powerful deities from the Augustine family, Osborne felt a swell of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without the support of the Blood Demon members, their strength was formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Sebastian spoke up, "Osborne, are we truly capable of launching a counterattack on the Deschanel Clan with our current strength? Are you confident </span><span>about this? Mightn't it be too risky? Should we perhaps wait a little longer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow was furrowed with concern. Despite the recent setback the Deschanel Clan had suffered, losing three Transcendent Deities to Osborne, God of Star, and Divine Shadow, their foundation remained robust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded with a calm smile, "Grandpa, rest assured. I wouldn't suggest this if I weren't confident. The Augustine family has endured oppression for too long. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the League of Divine Descent, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and now the Deschanel Clan&mdash;they all think they can trample over us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not anymore. It's time we retaliated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our power now rivals theirs; we can, and will, take them down. The Deschanel Clan will just be the first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was taken aback by Osborne's words but was soon reassured by the confidence in his grandson's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! You are the head of the Augustine family now. Your decision is our decision! If you believe we can achieve this, then go boldly ahead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We all believe in you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His affirmation echoed through the room, inspiring those present. Faces lit with </span><span>determination,</span><span> the members of the Augustine family nodded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, we believe in you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring down the Deschanel Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should they attack us while we can't do the same?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's take them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their resolve solidified; the gathering was no longer fraught with fear but united in a fiery resolve to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, they had all felt stifled and frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family, once the premier Ancient Family of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and the underground rulers of its world, had been beleaguered by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, League of Divine Descent, </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These forces had underestimated, pressured, and even threatened the Augustine family with extinction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were ready to unleash the full wrath of their long-harbored indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's decision to initiate an attack on the Deschanel Clan felt like striking a match to a long-set powder keg, sparking a collective eagerness for action among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, it's settled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, go get some rest and recharge. Tomorrow, we head to Hearin City and wipe out the Deschanel Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Osborne exited the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The decision to wait until tomorrow for the counterattack rather than moving immediately was deliberate. The Blood Demon members needed a bit more time to be fully prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had harnessed the abundant blood energy from the fallen three Transcendent Deities and seventeen Superior Deities of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he channeled this energy </span><span>to the Blood Demon members who were in the midst of their breakthroughs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the expansive training chamber on level two of the Augustine Bastion, the air was charged with immense energy emanating from over four hundred Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their auras grew more potent as the outline of a second Divine Flame appeared above their heads, gradually solidifying until it burst into a roaring blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the next day, a total of four hundred and fifty Blood Demon members had successfully advanced, reaching the rank of Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the Blood Demon Vanguard had all broken through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's excitement was palpable as he surveyed the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With nearly 48 hundred Blood Demon members having achieved godhood and possessing at least Level Three Divine Bodies, and with four hundred and fifty of them reaching Intermediate Deity, this was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a power capable of crushing any superpower on Blue Planet, even those at the overlord level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the presence of the Blood Demon members that fueled Osborne's confidence in launching an offensive against the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Demon members, prepare for action!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now we march&mdash;to obliterate the Deschanel Clan!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
