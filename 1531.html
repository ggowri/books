  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep digging!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never been particularly interested in Essence Crystals before. He thought they were of little use to him, considering the slow pace of cultivation they offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even using top-grade Essence Crystals, the speed just didn't cut it for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne believed having just enough would suffice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his perspective had shifted dramatically. Essence Crystals were the universal currency in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Whatever one wanted to do or buy required them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through Hannah, Osborne had learned about some incredible products made by the Artisan Institute, like the Malevolence Airship, which could soar at speeds rivaling the Deity King and even facilitate </span><span>inter-dimensional</span><span> travel. Then there was the Malevolence Shield, capable of withstanding multiple attacks from a Deity King without breaking, and weapons like the Malevolence Sword and Malevolence Axe that could easily pierce through a Deity King's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These items were on par with Ultimate divine artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it wasn't guaranteed that having Essence Crystals would allow one to buy them, not having them meant one had no chance at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take the Malevolence Airship, for instance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the rules, as a member of the Human Community, Osborne was only allowed to purchase a top-grade Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he had managed to buy an Ultimate Malevolence Airship from Hannah, shelling out over four hundred thousand mid-grade Essence Crystals&mdash;equivalent to five hundred million low-grade Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without sufficient Essence Crystals, he wouldn't even have been able to acquire a standard Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had enough Essence Crystals, everything seemed possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gellar family was willing to sell an Ultimate Malevolence Airship for Essence Crystals; who knew if one day, someone from the Paramount Supreme Clan might be willing to part with a Supreme Malevolence Airship for the same reason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supreme Malevolence Airship came equipped with offensive weapons, just like the Malevolence Shield, Malevolence Sword, and Malevolence Axe&mdash;ultimate divine artifacts that could also be obtained with enough Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he still couldn't acquire them, it simply meant he didn't have enough Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne now believed that the more Essence Crystals, the better. Not only could he buy powerful divine artifacts and treasures, but he could also ensure that everyone in Spark of Blaze never ran out of Essence Crystals for their cultivation, allowing them to rapidly improve their realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was digging like a madman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The various factions across </span><span>Celestara</span><span> would never have imagined that there would be someone like Osborne who could roam freely through the incredibly tough rocks of the mining area, using his Satan's Eye's terrifying X-ray vision to easily locate Essence Crystals. More importantly, he wielded incredible control, able to use spatial powers to swiftly transfer countless Essence Crystals into his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these unique abilities, Osborne had become a top-notch "miner." Wherever he went, every last mid-grade and top-grade Essence Crystal was stripped clean, leaving nothing behind for the miners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was a mining area belonging to a significant faction of the Demonic Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt no guilt about clearing out this site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a solid ten hours of work, he finally finished scouring Zone 7.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was just the core area, Zone 7 spanned over 160 miles, making it impossible to search every inch thoroughly without wasting time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he decided it was better to focus on other areas with higher Essence Crystal densities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sights were now set on Zone 6, not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the mining area of the Soaring Lion Clan, where the density of Essence Crystals was even higher than in Zone 7.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a moment to rest his eyes from the strain of using his Satan's Eye, Osborne reflected on the haul he had just collected from Zone 7.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After ten hours of hard work, I've managed to gather over a million top-grade Essence Crystals and more than a hundred million mid-grade Essence Crystals! When converted to low-grade Essence Crystals, that's over 20 billion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne had anticipated a good haul, he was still taken aback by the staggering amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty billion low-grade Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To put that into perspective, the Wild Flame Army, with its 500 thousand soldiers, only required three to five billion Essence Crystals for monthly military expenses, and that was already considered a generous allowance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people in </span><span>Celestara</span><span> received far fewer Essence Crystals each month than what the Wild Flame Army had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Essence Crystals he had just collected, Osborne could ensure that the entire Wild Flame Army wouldn't have to worry about their Essence Crystal consumption for the next five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just from scouring Zone 7!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've really struck gold this time!" Osborne murmured, trying to contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After using his spatial power for such an extended period to gather Essence Crystals, he noticed that his control over spatial energy had improved significantly. It felt like his space elemental essence had become subtly stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered that his space elemental essence was already at the peak of Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was just a step away from reaching Level Seven, which was the realm of the Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, comparing himself to Hannah, Osborne realized that his elemental essence was considerably more powerful than that of others at the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's hoping I can break through to Level Seven soon! Time to keep digging!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
