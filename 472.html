  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moved by the words, Osborne embraced Clarissa tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac watched the couple with a smile, feeling they were a perfect match, his eyes briefly clouded with memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, his expression turned solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitating, he finally spoke, "Osborne, I heard you've offended someone from the ancient families of Newport City. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They wanted to stop me from killing Alexander and even tried to snatch Clarissa's divine artifacts. I had to teach them a lesson, so yes, I suppose I have offended them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's unconcerned expression, Isaac looked puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, aren't you worried?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Worried about what? Their revenge? Don't worry, I'll handle this. Rather than them, I'm more concerned about the reactions from the Walker and Luther families."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. "You think the Walker and Luther families will make a move?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Definitely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned stern. "They are allies with the Paltrow family, all of them have targeted the Augustine family in the shadows, and they all have ties with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Now that I've wiped out the Paltrow family, they won't just sit back and do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They won't just watch the Augustine family swallow up the Paltrow family's assets and become the top ancient family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>! If I'm right, they're probably already figuring out how to deal with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Killing me would reset everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I'm alive, the future of </span><span>Dampston</span><span> will be decided by me. They're used to being on top and certainly won't accept this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, they won't let me live!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, after killing me, they can also divide up the vast assets of the Paltrow family. If I were them, I'd definitely make a move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished, a murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the uncertain timing of reprisal for offending Evelynn, Charlie, and others, Osborne felt that resolving issues with the Walker and Luther families and completing his fifth heir test was more urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he passed this test, he could finally meet the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Offending Evelynn didn't matter then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might be her cousin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Charlie and others like Larson, they were merely Evelynn's lackeys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't care about Evelynn, nor would he care about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne wasn't worried about Evelynn's vengeance; he was focused on quickly dealing with the Walker and Luther families, as well as other forces colluding with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's your plan?" Isaac asked gravely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "I've already devised a plan. I'm going to lure them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lure them out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. I will intentionally show a flaw, giving them a chance to kill me. Or rather, </span><span>I'll lure them into trying to kill me, hoping they'll all strike at once, and I'll counter them completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's expression grew extremely worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you sure about this? If they join forces, their power is nothing the Paltrow family can match. What if something goes wrong..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa also looked on worriedly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't respond, and his expression remained resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already nearly completed his fifth heir test; all he needed to do now was to eliminate the high-level members of the four ancient families colluding with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>&mdash;the Walker family, the Luther family, the Marion family, and the Hawthorne family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't want to waste any more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the risks, he was determined to bait them into making a move, and then he would strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, within the Walker Estate...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spacious conference room was packed with members of the Luther, Marion, and Hawthorne families. Everyone's faces were grim as they held a secret meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's all share our thoughts on what we should do," Shawn said, his face still pale from the punch Osborne had landed on him. His eyes were filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the heads of the Luther, Marion, and Hawthorne families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On behalf of the Walker family, I'll state our position first. That bastard Osborne, he must die! If he doesn't, none of us will have any peace. Osborne was able to wipe out the Paltrow family today; tomorrow, he could come for the Walkers. The day after that, the </span><span>Luthers</span><span> and then your Marion and Hawthorne families!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, we must unite and strike first and take out Osborne! As long as Osborne is dead, the Augustine family alone is no threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we'll have a chance to divide the Paltrow family's vast assets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I propose we move against Osborne immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's in favor? Who's opposed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Shawn finished speaking, everyone began whispering amongst themselves, their faces grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Walker, you've exchanged blows with Osborne. Are you certain that if we join forces, we can definitely kill him? That Osborne, his strength is terrifying," Emery, the head of the Marion family, asked with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's expression changed. Recalling his defeat at Osborne's hands, his face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Osborne's strength is indeed formidable. None of us from the four ancient families are a match for him individually. But together, we have thirteen Class A masters. That should be enough to deal with him alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emery frowned. "</span><span>So</span><span> there's no absolute certainty? In my view, Osborne's strength has definitely reached Class A+. Even with thirteen Class A masters, we may not be able to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, even if we can kill him, we'll undoubtedly suffer heavy losses. It's uncertain how many of us will make it back alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Emery finished speaking, the murmurs grew louder.</span></p><div class="pagination">
