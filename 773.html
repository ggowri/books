  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it's a fight you want, then let's do this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne calmly stepped onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi had been challenged several times before, easily defeating each opponent with her overwhelming strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was ranked 499th on the Global Godson Rankings, making her the lowest-ranked Godson among the challengers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her ranking was precarious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If a few more strong opponents emerged and were acknowledged by the Diviner League, she could be pushed off the Global Godson Rankings and lose her title as an Earth Godson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, she had to keep challenging others to improve her rank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi stared intensely at Osborne, her eyes filled with fierce battle intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you can still surrender now! Don't think that just because you beat Andrew with your Spatial Domain, you're on equal footing with us!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your Spatial Domain is useless against me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Is that so? I'm looking forward to it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph, you're asking for it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that Osborne had no intention of giving up, Emi instantly launched her attack, shrouding Osborne in her Dark Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Domain!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't hesitate and immediately expanded his Spatial Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two domains collided in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Crack! Crack!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Spatial Domain began to show signs of cracking under the pressure. He remained calm, using his powerful mental strength to hold it together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, your mental strength is impressive. It compensates for the instability of your Spatial Domain! Andrew lost to you because he couldn't break through it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I'm not like him! Do you think I'd challenge you without knowing how to break it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're only at Class AA. Once I shatter your Spatial Domain, you'll be trash before me! Now, I'll crush it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's destroy it together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Emi's Dark Realm exploded with tremendous power, slamming into Osborne's Spatial Domain. Even with his strong mental power, Osborne could no longer maintain the stability of his domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pop!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Spatial Domain shattered instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The backlash from his domain's collapse caused Osborne's face to pale as his mental strength took a hit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, his mental strength was robust enough that the backlash wasn't enough to injure him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In comparison, Emi was worse off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had intentionally shattered her own Dark Realm, causing both domains to collapse together. The mental backlash she suffered was far more severe than Osborne's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth, her face as pale as a sheet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, her eyes gleamed with fierce determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sneered. "Now I've lost my Dark Realm, and you've lost your Spatial Domain! But I'm Class AAA, and you're only AA!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've already lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Emi manipulated her powerful dark energy to attack Osborne. Even without her Dark Realm's amplification, her attacks were still terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne remained calm. Facing her dark energy, he responded with a single punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The power from his punch shattered Emi's attack in an instant, sending the energy back at her, causing her face to pale as her body was forced backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi stared at Osborne in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly. "Why do you think that just because we've both lost our domains, you can definitely win? You underestimate Class AA?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi's expression darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't believe it! Without your Spatial Domain, there's no way you can beat me! Come on, again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi became more serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She melded into the darkness, reappearing from Osborne's shadow, slashing at his neck with a sharp ancient artifact dagger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had anticipated her move. There was no way she could catch him off guard. He dodged her strike and countered with a powerful punch, forcing her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ensuing battle was intense. Even without their domains, both of them were top-tier fighters, unleashing wild bursts of energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bam!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Osborne found an opening, breaking through Emi's defenses and sending her flying out of the ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Huff!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Finally, I won!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked a bit exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The battle had been tough. Osborne, cautious of revealing his identity, had refrained from using many of his techniques, relying only on raw strength to fight Emi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though victorious in the end, he had used up a lot of energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As expected, none of the fighters on the Global Godson Rankings are easy to deal with!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that thought, Osborne prepared to step off the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at that moment, another figure stood up, glaring coldly at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, I'm challenging you next!"</p><div class="pagination">
