  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin's expression hardened dramatically as he processed Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just three days ago, he had assumed the role of head of the Swift family, riding high on the news of his engagement to Nydia, the illegitimate daughter of the Fero Tiger Clan's Laird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had felt invincible, and in a moment of impulse, he publicly accused "Lachlan" of pilfering treasures from the Swift family vault. With confidence, Calvin demanded that "Lachlan" return the stolen Essence Crystals and artifacts within three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin was convinced that "Lachlan" had somehow stumbled upon an ancient deity's trove and was simply looking for an excuse to make "Lachlan" hand it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed he could easily manipulate "Lachlan" into complying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to his utter shock, everything had flipped in less than a week. "Lachlan" not only established Spark of Blaze but had also skillfully fought off the combined might of Deity Overlord warriors Fabian and Gilbert, effectively wiping out both the Wolfe and Keynes families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind "Lachlan" now stood powerful allies&mdash;a late-stage Deity Overlord and dozens of Celestial Deity warriors&mdash;all of which eclipsed the Swift family's capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin's bravado evaporated; he no longer had the audacity to confront Osborne or demand that Osborne return to the Swift family and admit wrongdoing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The very thought made him shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, even if he wished to forget it, he knew that Osborne wouldn't let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced at him with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's the matter, Calvin? Cat got your tongue? Weren't you the one parading around, claiming I stole from the Swift family vault? Now I'm right here in front of you. Why don't you come and arrest me? Why not take me in and reclaim the Essence Crystals and treasures you're so obsessed with?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Afraid, are we? Is the new head of the Swift family actually scared?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're not a coward, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin felt a surge of fury at being mocked, even as he recognized the truth in Osborne's taunts. He was indeed terrified, but he would never voice such a weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through clenched teeth, Calvin managed to say, "Lachlan! You're going too far! After all, I'm your elder! Your father is my brother! How can you speak to me this way, with no respect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne burst into laughter, the sound echoing with derision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, suddenly you want to play the elder card? Am I mistaken, or weren't you the one who decided to kick me out of the Swift family and sever all ties?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now you strut around like you have the right to lecture me on manners?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seriously, do you even have any shame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, an idea struck Osborne, and he raised his voice dramatically. "I'm no longer part of the Swift family! You personally threw me out, Calvin! From now on, I won't be known as Lachlan Swift&mdash;I'll be Osborne Augustine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I have nothing to do with the Swift family anymore! I am who I am, and I'm just Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words reverberated through the crowd, amplified by his divine power, leaving no doubt about their clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had been biding his time to shed the name "Lachlan," which he had borrowed, and now was the perfect opportunity to reclaim his true identity openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew no one would blink an eye at this sudden change; after all, Celestara was vast and filled with people sharing names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin's face darkened, his composure slipping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne Augustine?! I don't care what name you choose! Whatever you want to call yourself, your father is still my brother! What do you plan to do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smirked coldly. "Still leaning on family ties?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sorry, I'm not playing that game anymore! I'll ask you again&mdash;Did I ever touch the Swift family's vault? Do you still want me to come crawling back to the Swift family and beg for forgiveness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin's face flickered between anger and uncertainty; the table had clearly turned, and the pressure was mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clenched his fists tightly, finally casting a glance at Darren, the masked figure beside Osborne, whose formidable presence radiated an icy killing intent. At that moment, Calvin felt a wave of submission wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through gritted teeth, he uttered, "I was mistaken before. The Swift family's vault hasn't been robbed, and you didn't steal anything from it. So, there's no need for you to apologize. I'm sorry for the trouble I caused earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this, a smirk spread across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Calvin's eyes flashed with rage. "So, Lachlan, do I have your permission to leave now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly. "Let me set the record straight&mdash;my name is Osborne now, not Lachlan! If you dare call me Lachlan again, don't say I didn't warn you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you've admitted your mistake, I suggest you get out of here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And remember, don't come looking for trouble with Spark of Blaze. Otherwise, you'll find yourself in deep water."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne surveyed the crowd around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And that goes for all of you too! Spark of Blaze has just gotten started. We're focused on training and growing stronger, not looking for fights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if anyone dares to push us, we won't hesitate to retaliate and eradicate you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just ask the Wolfe family and the Keynes family what happened to them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's icy declaration sent a tangible chill through the air. He met the cold stares of those around him with unwavering confidence, showing no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was about to rejoin the Wild Flame Army and perhaps head to Divine Peak Nine next; it was crucial to leave a lasting impression&mdash;one that would keep other factions at bay.</span></p><div class="pagination">
