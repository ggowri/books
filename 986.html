  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury coursed through Scarlett as she unleashed her Plant Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vines and roots exploded from the ground, some lunging aggressively toward Osborne, while others wound around her body, pulling her out of the clutches of the Space Collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roots and vines began enveloping her, forming a protective sphere several hundreds of yards wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hidden inside this massive ball of greenery, Scarlett took a moment to gather her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Even if I'm invoking the Plant Realm, I know I can't take on Osborne directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My goal isn't to defeat him; it's to buy time for my survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've sent out a distress signal in my own way, and the two Class S assassins aren't far off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their strength, they'll be here in no time, and that'll be his end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued his assault, the sheer force of his power shredding through the protective roots and vines&mdash;chinks began to appear in her defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, each time one was broken, more vines surged forth to fill the gaps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside her green fortress, Scarlett's expression darkened. Despite her layered defenses, she felt a creeping dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strength had only grown since their last encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett said, trying to sound resolute, "Osborne, you can't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're smart, you'd better make a quick exit. Otherwise, you'll end up trapped here permanently! In ten seconds, my reinforcement will be here, and you'll be toast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and said with a smirk, "Scarlett, are you scared? If they are really coming in ten seconds, why don't you just let me walk away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you afraid I'll finish you off in that time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to admit, women's intuition is spot on. Ten seconds? That's more than enough time for me to take you out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's get this party started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne launched himself toward her massive sphere composed of vines and roots, a chilling smile etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett's tension mounted as she commanded countless vines to whip toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura of his martial arts flared around him, shrugging off the slashes of the vines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vines struck against his aura, exploding into fragments, unable to inflict any damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back during the Honor Quest Ceremony, Scarlett had posed a genuine challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she was no better than other Class AAA assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" Osborne roared, unleashing a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fist, minuscule by comparison to the colossal sphere extending hundreds of yards, clashed with the immense orb&mdash;but in an instant, the sheer force unleashed pulverized the giant object into oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roots and vines erupted in chaos, and Scarlett was violently hurled backward, blood spilling from her mouth as she flew through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and fear painted her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne stood before her, his expression cold and triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flooded Scarlett's voice. "No! Osborne, you can't kill me! I'm Blood Princess! My parents are Sin and Crimson, top assassins in the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization! They're Class S elites; I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't give a damn who you are!" Osborne cut her off, delivering a swift kick that folded her body into itself, sending her spiraling away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was as frigid as ice. Without waiting for her to hit the ground, he appeared in front of Scarlett once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dare to mess with me? Don't think for a second that just because your parents are Class S elites, you're safe. Even if they were gods, I'd still make sure you bite the dust!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, say goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he launched a brutal kick aimed straight at Scarlett's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was running out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the powerful auras of two Class S assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization racing toward him, closing in fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without holding back any longer, Osborne targeted Scarlett's vital points. She was already gravely injured and had no chance to evade. All she could do was watch in horror as Osborne's foot hurtled toward her, the fear of death etched in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett's piercing scream was abruptly cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's kick connected with her head, shattering it like a ripe watermelon, blood, and brain matter spraying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the enraged shouts of two middle-aged men echoed through the air as they appeared hundreds of yards away. They froze, their eyes locking onto the gruesome scene&mdash;Osborne standing over Scarlett's mangled body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage ignited in their eyes, and the terrifying power of Class S assassins surged forth, locking onto Osborne. The very fabric of his Spatial Domain trembled violently as if it would shatter under the weight of their fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhhh</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you kill her?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead meat!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
