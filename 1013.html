  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, well, if it isn't my dear man missing me," Isa said, her face radiant with a smile as she stepped up to Osborne and wrapped her arms around his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I called Isa's name, and she actually appeared!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this be Isa's power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And how did she get behind me without me sensing a thing? If Isa were an assassin, I'd be dead by now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, I still can't get a read on Isa's true strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's powers had grown significantly since the Honor Quest Ceremony. He now stood well above the average Class S warrior, even capable of putting up a fight against top-tier Class S fighters like Sin or Crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite his considerable advancement, Isa remained an enigma&mdash;an unfathomable abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but give a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally confirmed that Isa had let him win during the Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping back to reality, Osborne looked tenderly into Isa's beautiful face and asked, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, how did you get here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quipped, "Why? Just missed my guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let me steal a kiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she planted a passionate kiss on Osborne's lips, only pulling away after what seemed an eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly asked, "What I mean is, did you really hear me calling your name? Is this a power of yours? I tried reaching to you by phone earlier, but it showed you were out of the network's reach. Then here you are, popping up out of nowhere! How did you manage that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, still smiling, replied, "Don't forget, I'm the disciple of the Goddess of Night! My teacher is a Deity King, one of the most powerful beings among gods. As her disciple, it's only natural I'd have some special tricks up my sleeve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then playfully winked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, Osborne felt Isa was holding back something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't press further; the priority now was Anastasia's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sense of urgency, he said, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, my sister's illness is cured, but her body is now experiencing new issues. I fear she might be in danger. I don't know who else to turn to for help besides you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa arched an eyebrow. "Oh? More trouble? In that case, let's hurry and take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly led Isa to Anastasia's ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they entered, Zoe spotted Isa, and her face lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bowin!" Zoe exclaimed, rushing over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her excitement quickly became a surprise as she noticed Isa holding Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bowin, Osborne, you two..." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa gave a nonchalant smile. "Little one, still stuck at Class A, huh? You're lagging behind in your training. And, I'm not only your mentor but also your brother's wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe just gaped, but Isa brushed off the moment and turned her attention to Anastasia, who lay in the center of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's beautiful face briefly displayed an expression of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, fearing Isa might not be able to solve Anastasia's problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, how is she doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head, remaining silent, and began to approach Anastasia slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne warned, "Be careful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The energy within Anastasia is highly unstable, and although she hasn't fully woken, she has a reactive response! Anyone who gets too close will be attacked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Isa didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly, she arrived within ten feet of Anastasia, whose immense energy seemed to feel the threat and immediately surged towards Isa with explosive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anastasia's energy had risen to the Class AAA level, advancing towards Class S. Any sudden discharge would require even Osborne to tread carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, however, remained calm and composed. Only when the energy was mere inches from her did she casually wave her hand, causing all the surging power to dissipate instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the erratic energy within Anastasia's body stabilized swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left stunned, his eyes wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every encounter with Isa left him in awe. Her strength seemed boundless; each time Osborne thought he might catch up, Isa would demonstrate abilities far beyond his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was an enigma, truly mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she really a disciple of the Goddess of Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, dismissing the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, he felt a deep sincerity from Isa; no matter how formidable she was, she would never harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward and whispered, "Isa, anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa scrutinized Anastasia's form, her fingers stroking her chin as she pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she spoke, "No need to worry. This energy is inherently hers, cultivated through her own efforts. I hadn't realized her body was so unique before."</span></p><div class="pagination">
