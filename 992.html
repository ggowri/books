  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the surge of his newly upgraded Devil's Light, Osborne couldn't help but grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next step was to integrate this power into his martial art aura, which would significantly enhance his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as his strength grew, so too did the caliber of his opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, he had faced a string of formidable foes and had come to recognize a glaring weakness in his arsenal&mdash;his defensive capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's previous martial art aura, infused with Level Eight Devil's Light, was already quite powerful. Most opponents at the same level would struggle to breach it unless they wielded a potent divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the unfortunate truth was that Osborne's opponents were rarely of the same </span><span>caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Class S warriors could truly be considered his equals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those encounters, his martial art aura often fell short, leaving him vulnerable and frequently injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he had the Light of Redemption to heal him, the sting of injury was never pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, the Light of Redemption wasn't something he could use on a whim; it had a cooldown of half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More often than not, Osborne found himself battered and bruised long before he could call upon its restorative powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, boosting his defensive strength had become a priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could improve his defenses, he could engage Class S opponents more comfortably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had considered seeking a defensive divine artifact, similar to Emma's Swallow Shield, but ultimately decided against it. Such artifacts were rare and hard to come by, and relying on external forces could be a double-edged sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, enhancing the strength of his martial art aura became the most viable option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite already being far stronger than others at his level, Osborne felt there was still room for improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the Level Nine Devil's Light at his disposal, he was ready to take that leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's find out just how strong it can get," Osborne thought, focusing intently as he began to merge the Level Nine Devil's Light with his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the dark, shimmering energy made contact with his aura, it reacted violently, like ice meeting boiling water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is new... I've never experienced anything like this before. What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, he pressed on, determined to maintain control as he merged the energies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around him hummed with energy. Most practitioners found it challenging to blend martial arts with elemental powers, as they were two distinct paths of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had an advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he broke through to Class A, he had fused the soul of powers with his body, allowing him to combine his martial art aura with Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, with the Devil's Light reaching Level Nine, something unprecedented was occurring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sure if this change was a blessing or a curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm grip on the Level Nine Devil's Light, Osborne forced it deeper into his martial art aura. Instantly, the once vibrant red aura was tinged with a shadowy black, creating a mesmerizing swirl of colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the fusion was far from complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red and black energies began to pulse and swirl violently, like a tempest brewing in the sky, spinning and twisting beyond his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Complete the fusion! Transform!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden spark ignited within Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Level Nine Devil's Light is undergoing the most profound fusion with my martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, while my Devil's Light could merge with my martial art aura, it was superficial, more of a mixing than a true integration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They complemented each other, becoming stronger, but only in a 1+1=2 manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they are fusing completely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Nine Devil's Light seemed to reach a zenith, merging with an equally potent martial art aura, catalyzing a miraculous metamorphosis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This integration was inherently greater than 1+1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they were evolving!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hum reverberated through the air as ten minutes passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The profound fusion and transformation finally concluded, enveloping Osborne in a crimson glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This signified his new martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the intensity of his aura, Osborne couldn't help but be exhilarated. Yet, he retrieved the Goddess of Grain's scythe and tested his aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scythe penetrated his aura, but Osborne felt an intense resistance akin to slicing through tough hide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Goddess of Grain's scythe, Osborne could effortlessly breach the defenses of Class S powerhouses as easily as slicing paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant his defense now far surpassed ordinary Class S powerhouses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's excitement surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the ultimate state of martial art aura? Its defensive capability has at least increased tenfold compared to before! Ordinary Class S powerhouses wielding divine artifacts won't easily penetrate my aura again!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
