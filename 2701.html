  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that Osborne's plan was very successful, and everything went smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the powerful effect of the Domain Suppression Stele, Osborne's prey didn't even have the chance to send out a distress signal. Although the opponent was a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, without the ability to use energy and relying solely on physical strength, he was no match for Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash easily defeated and subdued him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't even have a chance to act, only staying alert for unexpected situations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, no unexpected events occurred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What followed was no surprise. Drum directly extracted a Soulbane Parasite from the opponent's Soul Current Ocean, controlled it using a special method, and then placed it back into the opponent's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the Soulbane Parasite reattached, Osborne successfully took control of the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne completely healed the opponent's injuries with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ordered, "Continue with your previous mission and never reveal your identity! If Frederick makes any move, inform me immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other party nodded respectfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go! We're hunting the next target!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne put away the Domain Suppression Stele and quickly returned to Ascending Sacred Sanctum with Flash to meet Kendra.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, is it resolved?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. "Yes, very smoothly! Lead the way, let's hunt the next target!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kendra looked excited upon hearing this, her eyes filled with admiration for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Osborne looked at her, she quickly composed herself and pointed a direction for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne swiftly maneuvered the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, approaching the second target. It was a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, stronger than the previous one, but the outcome was no surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the Domain Suppression Stele took effect, his fate was sealed. Osborne rode Flash, who struck him down mercilessly, leaving him unable to resist, and then Drum stepped in to subdue him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second target was taken down by them too!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, under Kendra's guidance, Osborne quickly located one target after another, defeating, subduing, and controlling them in the same manner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the surface, these people appeared no different from before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in reality, they were no longer under Frederick's control and had become Osborne's subordinates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time flew by during such operations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, in deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally arrived at Elf City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda looked at Elf City in the distance, so excited she almost jumped up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isa, Clarissa, should we go straight in?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda looked at Isa and Clarissa. After spending time together, their relationship had become very close, and Alfreda had also accepted the fact that she was Osborne's seventh girlfriend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had great respect for Isa and Clarissa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa's cultivation level was at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa's cultivation level was advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their cultivation levels made Alfreda extremely envious; it was something she had never even dared to dream of.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa smiled slightly, "Let's go straight in! Elf City's strength is just an ordinary Second-rate Power, with only a dozen Empyrean Sacredness warriors, most of whom are primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors. Their strongest warrior is merely advanced Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With our strength, there's no need to sneak around; we can just go straight in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Isa's face was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Alfreda even more envious. She stuck out her tongue and said, "Isa, when will I be as powerful as you guys? I really want to break through to Empyrean Sacredness too..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa smiled and said, "Alfreda, don't worry! With Osborne around, are you still concerned about improving your cultivation level? Once we rescue your parents and brother, Osborne will definitely help you! He'll make sure your cultivation level breaks through to Empyrean Sacredness as quickly as possible, catching up with us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He still has plenty of emperor fruits on him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, Alfreda's eyes immediately lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! Let's go in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Alfreda took a deep breath and stepped forward toward Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa and Clarissa controlled their aura, concealing their cultivation level. Unless someone was stronger than them, no one could discern their true strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them walked to the gate of Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the guards at the city gate saw Alfreda, froze, and rubbed their eyes in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda said coldly, "Move aside! Can't you see I'm back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Alfreda?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guard exclaimed in surprise, his eyes full of delight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So it's Princess Alfreda who has returned! Please come in! Come in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guard quickly stepped aside, while one hand hid behind his back, swiftly spreading the news of Alfreda's return to Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She naturally noticed the guard's small movements, but sensing the presence of Isa and Clarissa behind her, she instantly felt confident and ignored the guards entirely, striding in boldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the three of them entered Elf City, the guards immediately closed the city gates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, a massive shield appeared over Elf City, covering the entire city and preventing anyone from leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several guards sneered at Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda glanced at Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa gave a faint smile, glanced at Elf City's Protective Barrier, and calmly said, "No problem! I can break it easily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda immediately felt more at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She ignored the guards since they were just following orders. Her true enemy was Elf City's strongest warrior, Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go, we'll head to the Elven Mother Tree first to rescue my parents and brother!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda led Isa and Clarissa deeper into Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Passing by Emerald Forest Lodge, she couldn't help but stop. Looking at the long-abandoned Emerald Forest Lodge, her face was full of tenderness and memories.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was where she first met Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her beautiful memories with Osborne were also here!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After watching for a while, Alfreda quickened her pace and soon reached the depths of Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By this time, more and more Elf City guards had gathered around them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The guards stared excitedly at Alfreda but didn&rsquo;t approach, only followed from a distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Alfreda saw the massive Elven Mother Tree in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the aura of the Elven Mother Tree, Alfreda's body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a figure suddenly appeared, blocking her path.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Isidore!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind Isidore were more than a dozen powerful figures, all warriors of Empyrean Sacredness. At this moment, they were all looking at Alfreda with some astonishment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore's face was also full of surprise, even a hint of confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Alfreda?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda glared at Isidore, her eyes instantly bursting with intense anger and killing intent. She clenched her fists tightly, staring at him fiercely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, she was killed by Isidore!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for Osborne saving her with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, she would have been completely dead. Her parents and brother were also imprisoned and tortured by Isidore, ultimately forced to merge with the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Alfreda's hatred for Isidore was incredibly intense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "It's me! I'm back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore was even more shocked. "It's really you? You're still alive? That's impossible! I saw you self-destruct with my own eyes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda sneered, "You didn't see wrong! I did self-destruct! But I didn't die! And my self-destruction was all because of you! Now, I'm back alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isidore, your time has come!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
