  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before arriving, Raoul had known deep down that convincing the major factions of the Mystic Feather Clan was an uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had to try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul said, "I understand you don't believe me. I'm not here to change your minds. I've passed on the warning, and if you choose not to trust me, that's out of my hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who are willing to believe can head back and gather your people. Make sure everyone is ready and come to my place at once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a plan that can save us all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Better to trust it might be true than to dismiss it and regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, Raoul turned on his heel and left, making his way back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, what's the situation?" Hannah asked anxiously as he arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul shook his head. "Nobody believes me! They refuse to acknowledge that the Demonic Dragon Clan, the Soaring Lion Clan, and the Bowman family would ever </span><span>take action against the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I've spread the word; it should at least spark some caution. They might send scouts near the floating mountain of the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If something does go down, maybe it'll save some lives... though I hope to the heavens that it won't come to that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was grave, and Hannah bit her lip</span><span>. She knew</span><span> all too well that trouble was indeed on the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pondered, "But if even Grandfather can't convince the different factions, how can someone like me, who's never shown my true face, hope to make anyone believe us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is a fight really unavoidable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a group approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raoul! I've brought my people! Others may doubt you, but we from the several prominent families stand with you! We're putting our lives in your hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul's heart lifted at the news. "Really? That's fantastic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few allies had brought their people along. While the numbers were modest</span><span>, </span><span>only over 100 thousand</span><span>. But it</span><span> was better than nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, get them into the Dimensional Microcosm right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!" Hannah replied, her spirits bolstered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the newcomers were safely inside the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul assumed a serious tone. "It looks like no one else will be coming. Hannah, you need to leave right now and find a safe place to hide! You hold the key to the Dimensional Microcosm. If something were to happen to you, all those people inside would be in peril, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah frowned. "Grandpa, what about everyone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul clenched his jaw. "There's nothing we can do!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they refuse to believe us, we can't force them into the Dimensional Microcosm! Right now, our priority is to protect those who do trust us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You go ahead; I'll stay here and keep an eye on the situation! Don't worry, if what you described really happens, I'll run away immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah hesitated. "But Grandpa, you should come with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you go first! I want to see if there's any way I can save more lives. I'm not easy prey. I promise, if trouble comes, I'll escape right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Hannah nodded. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't shake the massive weight on her shoulders; after all, inside her Dimensional Microcosm were over 100 thousand Mystic Feather Clan members. If anything happened to her, many lives would be at stake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Hannah turned to leave, she had just stepped away from the floating mountain when the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan finally set their plans in motion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four Supreme Malevolence Airships emerged from the floating mountains of the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan. Before anyone could fully comprehend what was happening, these ships executed an interdimensional travel maneuver that spanned the entirety of Wild Flame City, </span><span>and left</span><span> no time for the </span><span>Mystic Feather Clan to react. In an instant, the four airships had surrounded the floating mountain of the Mystic Feather Clan</span><span> and </span><span>effectively seal</span><span>ed</span><span> off any escape routes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of interdimensional travel was astonishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the airships encircled the Mystic Feather Clan's floating mountain, the expressions of those still on the mountain shifted dramatically from confusion to horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a chilling voice resonated from one of the Supreme Malevolence Airships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Feather Clan of Wild Flame City, you dare to conspire with the Human Community and kill my son, Tobey! You will pay for your treachery! I, Aldrich, am here by the command of the esteemed Lord Malevolence to exterminate all of you who have betrayed him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare to descend into hell and atone for your sins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Aldrich, standing on the deck of one of the airships, waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, all four Supreme Malevolence Airships unleashed a barrage of firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main cannons and secondary weapons roared to life, unleashing a torrent of devastating energy attacks that rained down upon the Mystic Feather Clan's floating mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Feather Clan had no time to react as the terrifying assault erupted without warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had doubted Raoul, who believed the Bowman family, the Demonic Dragon Clan, and the Soaring Lion Clan would never turn against them, found themselves caught in the crossfire of indiscriminate destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, countless Mystic Feather Clan warriors were obliterated by the relentless firepower of the Supreme Malevolence Airships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was filled with chaos, screams, and the thunderous roar of explosions as the reality of their dire situation sank in.</span></p><div class="pagination">
