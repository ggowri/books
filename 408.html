  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor fled wildly, no longer caring about the Aberrants' plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he directed all his strength to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could his speed compare to a space elemental metahuman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dealing with all the Class A- masters, Osborne had already locked onto Victor with Satan's Eye. With a cold smirk, he tore open a dimensional rift casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attempting to escape?" Osborne murmured, stepping into the rift, and in the next moment, appeared right in front of Victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his figure emerge from the rift, Victor was utterly despairing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll fight you to the death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor roared, gathering all his strength into his fist, veins bulging on his face, and his neck strained as he launched a fierce punch toward Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps I can test the defensive power of level six Devil's Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, Osborne did not counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even retracted his martial art aura, invoking the Devil's Light. A layer of blue Devil's Light enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Victor's full-force strike hit Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying power erupted. The surrounding sea actually blasted a giant pit in the aftermath of the force, which took a long time to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne stood firm as if rooted, not retreating a single step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue Devil's Light around him only vibrated slightly, effortlessly deflecting Victor's all-out attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Spiral Force, Victor's efforts were in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an attack, even if repeated several times, might not shatter Osborne's level six Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was delighted, thinking, "My level six Devil's Light is even stronger than my martial art aura! And yet, my metahuman rank is only Class B+!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not a Class A Power Master, but my Devil's Light is definitely stronger than that of an average Class A Power Master! Level six Devil's Light is terrifyingly powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family in Newport City had inherited for thousands of years, with countless people having activated Satan's Eye. But they had only ever devoured five elemental essence, merging into Level Four Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Higher levels of Devil's Light had never appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unprecedentedly devoured the elemental essence, merging into level six Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level six Devil's Light was terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With it, Osborne, though still a Class B+ Power Master, was already on par with an average Class A Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coupled with his many tricks, an ordinary Class A Power Master who dared to underestimate him might die in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was all smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Victor was extremely horrified at this moment. His all-out strike did not cause any harm to Osborne! Not even the pale blue energy shield on his body was broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt as if it was an unbreakable solid wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor was horrified and fled frantically again. He knew he couldn't escape, yet what else could he do but run?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, then dove into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a terrifying force erupting, his body moved like a nimble fish, frantically heading towards the deep sea, hoping Osborne would not dare to pursue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could Osborne let him go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Entering the water? You'll die even faster!" Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had devoured the water elemental essence. In terms of controlling the water elemental, he was unrivaled by any water elemental metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, the water immediately parted, revealing a deep cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at the end of the cave was the frantically fleeing Victor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed to Victor's rear in an instant and unhesitatingly launched a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor spat out a mouthful of blood, feeling as if he had been hit by a train. He was struck to the bottom of the sea, hundreds of feet deep, motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's long hair coiled around his body instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over. It's a wrap! Let me see who you all are! Which ancient families in Dampston are colluding with the Aberrants?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, pulling Victor and that dozen Class A- masters in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation filled their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Victor's defeat by Osborne, they knew survival was out of the question. They bit into the poison capsules hidden in their teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor did the same, glaring at Osborne with venom. "Whoever you are, your end is near! The Aberrants will hunt you down. We'll return to Rosmandi and reclaim our rightful place from Godfather's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are waiting for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his furious outburst, Victor waited for the poison to take effect, expecting a swift death that would leave no trace, not even of his body, ensuring his identity would forever remain a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, his expectations were misguided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Attempting suicide by poison? I'm afraid, in my presence, you don't even have the right to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think your bluff will lead me to believe you're part of the Aberrants? How pitiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne brandished an antidote crafted by Isa, forcing them to ingest it, robbing them of even the solace of death.</span></p><div class="pagination">
