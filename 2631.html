  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's hard to say whether the difficulty has been lowered or increased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne has to face a hundred enemies at the same time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of his enemies has surpassed primary Empyrean Sacredness, and they are stronger than usual. Even if Seraphina joins forces with fifty-six others, defeating all the enemies within ten breaths won't be easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What happened next indeed confirmed Osborne's guess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The great battle broke out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina dared not hold back much. She, along with the other princes and princesses, quickly dealt with the enemies in front of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two-thirds of the hundred enemies were dealt with by the six of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when the battle was over, they realized that twelve breaths had already passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since the time had exceeded ten breaths, each of them could only receive half of the maximum reward in battle points, which was five million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These rewards were already more than enough for them. After all, most of them had earned less than one million battle points in the rewards from the previous nine levels. However, now they easily gained five million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Seraphina and the other five were clearly dissatisfied, as they all wanted to get the highest reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this point, Seraphina could say no more and simply said, "We should cooperate better next time. With our strength, we can easily defeat the opponents within ten breaths. Our teamwork was too clumsy, and we interfered with each other, which led to mistakes and chaos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone nodded and didn&rsquo;t dare say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. We'll move on to the eleventh level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Seraphina and the others entered the eleventh level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and the other three quickly arrived at the tenth level's trial site.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are those a hundred projections of warriors who reached primary Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara frowned, "Could it be that their team has too many people? We have fewer members, so maybe our opponents will also be fewer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne felt it was unlikely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said nothing. Then, the four of them stepped into the beam of light together, ready for the trial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a hundred power projections appeared opposite them, all representing various Beast Clan creatures like fierce tigers, mighty lions, divine dragons, and phoenixes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Clara, Leroy, and Casey all took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There really are a hundred opponents!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter how many people are tested, the number of opponents is fixed, right? In that case, with only four of us, won't we be at a disadvantage?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey all frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's team had as many as fifty-six people, but Osborne's only had four. Facing a hundred opponents with fifty-six people versus just four is definitely a completely different situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each member of Seraphina's team only needed to face less than two opponents, but Osborne and the other three had to handle an average of twenty-five opponents each.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There&rsquo;s a disparity of over tenfold between the two teams.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;No wonder Princess Seraphina was so sure we&rsquo;d regret it. Turns out this is what our next challenge looks like&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey all looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. More people doesn&rsquo;t always mean better. Princess Seraphina&rsquo;s team previously became chaotic due to having too many members. They ultimately took over ten breaths of time to clear the challenge.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;We have fewer people, so it&rsquo;s actually easier to coordinate.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;As long as we&rsquo;re strong enough, even with just the four of us, we can still clear it.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne took out the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Next, we need to get the highest reward possible for each level. With the rate of reward increase, if we can achieve the highest reward in every level, by the time we reach the eighteenth floor, we&rsquo;ll be able to exchange battle points for several Supreme Sacred Artifacts!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Clara, Leroy, and Casey's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. Let's give it a try!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll act first, and you support me. You should immediately take down any opponents I haven't defeated."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, as Osborne unleashed a burst of power, the Battle Points Monument instantly glowed red, and countless Sacred Power Arrows had already shot out from Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the next second, the hundred warriors' projections opposite them suddenly shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four passed the level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara, Leroy, and Casey hadn't even reacted yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than one breath, they accomplished it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hundred warriors' projections at the primary Empyrean Sacredness level on the eleventh floor had all been taken down by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey couldn't help but look at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just gave a faint smile. To him, this was nothing, and he even felt his opponents were too weak, lacking any challenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. We're heading to the eleventh floor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took less than one breath to deal with a hundred warriors' projections, so they naturally received the highest reward for the tenth-floor trial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them received ten million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The difficulty of the eleventh floor increased compared to before, but it was still nothing to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He effortlessly defeated those opponents again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, each of them received another ten million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the twelfth floor, they achieved the same result.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were already a bit numb. They basically didn't need to do anything, as if just following Osborne would easily earn them thirty million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, on the thirteenth floor, the difficulty increased again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the hundred warriors' projections, ten had cultivation levels reaching mid Empyrean Sacredness, while the other ninety were warriors who had just broken through primary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This level of difficulty made Seraphina and the others take thirty breaths to finally finish the battle, so they only received one-fifth of the maximum reward in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the reward for the thirteenth floor increased tenfold again, with the maximum reward reaching one hundred million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, even if they only got one-fifth of the maximum reward, each of them received twenty million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made everyone in Seraphina's team incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We've reached the thirteenth floor! Only five more floors to go before we reach the eighteenth floor and successfully obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina felt excited and full of anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although the challenges ahead will get tougher, I&rsquo;m confident I can lead everyone to successfully obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, since you&rsquo;re unwilling to team up with me and follow my lead, your group of four will face a full hundred opponents just like us.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It will be very difficult for you to clear the level, so it's even less likely for you to earn high rewards.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told you, you would regret it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, she continued leading the team to search for the trial location on the fourteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, she wasn&rsquo;t very familiar with the situation on the fourteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The royal family had sent few people to explore the Celestial Spire, and most of them couldn&rsquo;t reach the fourteenth floor, so she had little experience to rely on. She could only search for the trial location on her own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, Seraphina took over an hour to finally find the trial location on the fourteenth floor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, they took a full ninety breaths to finally pass the trial, and each of them only received one-tenth of the highest reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had just left when Osborne and the other three arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their pace is too slow. It seems we can't follow them anymore; it would just be a waste of our time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From the next floor onward, we must find a way to surpass them and arrive before they do. If we reach the eighteenth floor first, we can take the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
