  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held the exhausted Clarissa in his arms, feeling both moved and concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blushed and shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, as long as you are happy, I'm fine. I'm just a little tired. Then, I'm going to exercise well next time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished saying that, and her pretty face turned even redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa hugged his neck, pouted, and said coquettishly, "I have no strength left. Osborne, can you carry me to take a shower?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at her and immediately smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody would have thought that the usually cold-faced Clarissa, who seemed like an eternal iceberg in front of everyone else, would have such a demeanor in front of him. She even acted coy and playful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately picked up Clarissa and carried her horizontally towards the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to do anything. I'll help you take a bath."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her pretty face turned even redder, but she had a happy smile on her face and nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some fun in the bathroom, the two finally got dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, when you're done with your work, can you go shopping with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa continued, "Since I was young, I have always longed for a normal life, like that of an ordinary person. Although I won't be rich, I will be free and can do whatever I want without anyone paying attention to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might not believe it, but I've never been able to go shopping like an ordinary person until now. Every time I go out, there's always a group of bodyguards following me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, she bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt distressed as he heard this, and said, "No need to wait for later. Let's go now! Today, I will accompany you to have a good look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was pleasantly surprised, but frowned and said worriedly, "Osborne, don't be in such a rush. If we leave the Augustine Estate now, won't it be dangerous? Didn't you say that the Walker family and the Luther family must be planning to kill you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Then let's go put on makeup!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, he found two </span><span>skinmasks</span><span> from the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne was no longer in need of money. In his Dimensional Space, he had prepared many items that may come in handy, including over a dozen </span><span>skinmasks</span><span> alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, there was one that was just right for Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the two put on </span><span>skinmasks</span><span> and changed their appearance completely. Osborne transformed into a wealthy elite, giving off the impression that he didn't lack money. Clarissa's perfect beauty was concealed, revealing her as just a pretty girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even people who were very familiar with them would not be able to recognize them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to avoid being discovered, Osborne tore open the dimensional rift, took Clarissa through the interdimensional travel, and left the Augustine Estate quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the two of them took a taxi to the most bustling street in </span><span>Pinchide</span><span> City. Here, world-renowned luxury brands were gathered, and as long as one had money, he could buy almost anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them walked hand in hand in the dense crowd, just like an ordinary couple strolling among various shops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was very happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed that she didn't actually have any specific items she wanted to buy. Clarissa simply enjoyed the simplicity of an ordinary life. To her, a life of privilege and superiority wasn't nearly as interesting as the life of an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walking out of a luxury goods store, she still didn't buy anything. Osborne wanted to give her something, but couldn't find a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he saw a little girl selling flowers not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking for a while, Osborne said, "Clarissa, let's go that way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took Clarissa and walked towards the little girl selling flowers. The little girl was about seven or eight years old. She was dirty and seemed to have just fallen. Even the flowers in her hands were covered with mud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were fixed on every passing couple as she approached them, trying to sell the flowers in her hands. However, she faced rejection after rejection due to the dirt on the flowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with eagerness and pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was about to approach the little girl, several young men suddenly walked up to the little girl quickly. They stared at the flowers in her hands with sneers on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at them, fear all over her face, and whispered something, as if she was explaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the young man didn't listen at all. He slapped the little girl in the face, knocking her to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kicked the girl a few times with his feet and then grabbed her by the hair, pulling her up forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people around witnessed the situation, but they didn't dare to intervene. Their faces changed, and they quickly retreated to a safe distance with some fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne and Clarissa got annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, let's help her!" she bit her lip and whispered to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and walked quickly towards the little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at? Get out of here right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the young men noticed Osborne approaching and immediately stepped </span><span>forward, blocking his way. He had an extremely arrogant and threatening expression in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored the young man's threat and said, "She is just a little girl, so why do you want to hit her? Let her go immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the young man laughed, and his laughter was extremely unbridled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Osborne's collar and sneered, "Guy, I advise you not to meddle in our affairs. Do you know who we are? We are from the Hummingbird Gang! If you don't want to die, get out of here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I'll kill you and feed you to the fish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying that, the young man patted his waist, revealing a pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression suddenly became more indifferent.</span></p><div class="pagination">
