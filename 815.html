  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next moment, a chilling and furious voice cut through the air.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're dead!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You killed my son Cuthbert?! You're finished!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll make sure you die!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thunderous roar echoed in Osborne's ears, shaking his mind and causing blood to ooze from his ears.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The voice seemed distant, but its terrifying power was something he couldn't possibly withstand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A storm of dread surged within him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Class S Supreme Overlord of the Williamson family, Cuthbert's father&mdash;Marvin&mdash;had arrived!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Run!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Faced with a Class S Supreme Overlord, Osborne had no desire to fight. Even though he had just reached Class AAA, he was still no match for a Class S.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fact that Marvin could immobilize him from such a distance was proof enough. If it came to a fight, he'd be dead in no time.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, Osborne tore open a dimensional rift and dove through it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next moment, he reappeared six miles away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Six miles?!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought frantically, "When I was Class AA, I could travel 30 miles in one jump. Now that I'm Class AAA, it should be farther, at least 60 miles.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the space around me is frozen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though I can still use interdimensional travel, the distance is restricted by at least tenfold!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Six miles per jump! Can I even escape?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face was grim.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph! Do you really think you can escape? You killed my son! I'll flay you alive! I'll make the entire Augustine family pay for my son's death!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's voice boomed again, filled with rage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A monstrous force bore down on Osborne, making him feel as if a mountain was crushing him, slowing his movements.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's heart raced. He had traveled six miles but was still within Marvin's reach.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have to keep running!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Desperate to escape, Osborne tore through another dimensional rift, seeking to distance himself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had no desire to fight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Facing a Class S powerhouse's overwhelming power left him with only one thought&mdash;flee or die!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The frozen space meant every jump consumed more mental energy. Even with his enhanced mental strength at Class AAA, it wouldn't last forever.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could only hope he would escape the frozen space before his mental reserves ran out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Again and again, Osborne tore through dimensional rifts, his face growing paler with each jump. But the space around him remained stubbornly frozen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Osborne sensed a terrifying force closing in fast.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin was catching up faster than his interdimensional travel!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't get away!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's voice was now laced with fury. Clearly, he hadn't anticipated that his Class S power would take this long to catch up with Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The frustration only fueled his speed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne dared not stop, frantically tearing open dimensional rifts.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, a terrifying force pierced through the void, smashing into the rift and shattering it instantly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was violently thrown from the rift, crashing heavily to the ground. He landed hard, shaking violently, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is bad!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face was a mask of horror. His escape through the dimensional rift had been thwarted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next instant, a cold, imposing figure descended like a meteor, slamming into the ground nearby and creating a massive crater.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Marvin, the head of the Williamson family and Cuthbert's father.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin glared at Osborne, his eyes filled with lethal intent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why aren't you fleeing anymore? I told you, you can't escape me! You killed my son Cuthbert, and I'm going to flay you alive! Everyone connected to you will die! They'll all pay for my son's death!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's face twisted with rage, his murderous intent boiling over.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took a deep breath and slowly rose to his feet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Realizing there was no way out and determined not to die without a fight, he steeled himself for a confrontation. Even though Osborne knew his chances of winning against a Class S like Marvin were almost nonexistent, he had no choice but to fight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Survival seemed almost impossible, but he had to try.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If that's the case, then bring it on!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You want to kill me? To avenge your son? Then come at me! Even if I die here today, I'll make sure to take a piece of you with me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's voice was filled with defiance, his eyes burning with fury. He quickly retrieved his swallow shield, Axe of Strength, and Volt Hammer from Dimensional Space.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The shield floated in front of him as he gripped the Volt Hammer in his left hand and the Axe of Strength in his right. With a slight crouch, he braced himself for battle.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A fierce determination radiated from him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Class S Supreme Overlord, is it? Let's see what you've got!"</p><div class="pagination">
