  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced quickly at the preview map and frowned. It was clear that this was not a true representation. The terrain depicted was inaccurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, while "Apocalypse City" was marked, its location was likely miles off&mdash;perhaps even tens of millions of miles distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The layout within the city could be drastically different as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purpose of the map seemed to be to give potential buyers a rough idea of the map's detail, what it indicated, and the level of precision they might expect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this be the most detailed map available? Isn't there a more advanced version?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed the map's imprecision right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several areas appeared blurry, with discrepancies that were hard to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take "Divine Peak Nine" in the East Zone, for example. Osborne immediately pointed out that the position marked on the map was off by more than 6000 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident this was merely a rough sketch, far from accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While usable, it fell short of what Osborne required.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestara was vast, and to navigate it effectively, he needed interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any significant error in the map could lead to catastrophic miscalculations during such travels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just imagine! If he ended up in the core of Divine Peak by mistake, that would be a disaster waiting to happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the chances were slim, it was a risk Osborne refused to take, especially when he had plenty of Celestial Crystals to spend. He was determined to secure the most precise and accurate map available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His question made the sales associate visibly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, I'm sorry, but this is the most detailed map we offer! There are indeed higher-grade maps, but they're classified as top secret! Only for military use, and purchasing them requires special clearance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyebrows knitted together at this information. "Top-secret maps? For military use? What kind of clearance are we talking about? Surely, there's a way to get my hands on one? I can pay with Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate looked even more torn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I'm not sure what kind of clearance is needed since I've never dealt with such requests. No one has ever come looking for that kind of map before. Would you like me to escalate this to my supervisor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Yes, please do. That would be great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate hurried off to consult her superior, leaving Osborne to wait patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice startled him from behind. "Are you looking to purchase one of the higher-grade maps?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tensed, nearly jumping out of his skin. He hadn't sensed anyone approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person had sneaked up behind him, and he hadn't even noticed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this guy had intended to attack or kill him, Osborne might already be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around swiftly, and his heart sank in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His surprise was palpable&mdash;standing there was the very Supernal Deity King who had intervened at the Miracle Elixir auction to protect him from Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder man's smile was warm and disarming, but Osborne was still on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know me?" the Supernal Deity King inquired lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, feeling the heat of apprehension, shook his head quickly. "Not personally, sir! But I must thank you for stepping in at the auction. I truly appreciated your help when it came to Kurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder chuckled, "Thank me? Or should you blame me for meddling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seemed quite eager for Kurt to take a swing at you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sheepish grin crossed Osborne's face as he awkwardly scratched the back of his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the elder's expression turned serious. "Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Xanto Hodge, a Guardian Knight of the Sanctum of Light. Currently, I oversee operations at the Luminous Commerce Center in Apocalypse City, making me the highest authority here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened, and he quickly responded, "I'm Theodore Augustine. It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Hodge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xanto squinted, his gaze piercing as if he were trying to read Osborne's very soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really call yourself 'Theodore Augustine'? That's just a cover, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit embarrassed, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly, but he wasn't intimidated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using an alias was not uncommon. He had nothing to fear from a Supernal Deity King if he had never done anything to harm the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Xanto realized that "Theodore" was indeed just a pseudonym, he let out a disappointed sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it's just a fake name... I had hoped the real 'Theodore' of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings had come to see me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that were the case, I could have sold you a military map. Unfortunately, since you're not him, that's off the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, it's reassuring to see someone of your caliber in the Human Community&mdash;there's hope for the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Xanto prepared to walk away. "By the way, that arrogant scion from the Baxter family has gathered a bunch of strong folks outside to hunt you down! You should ask the sales associate to sneak you out the back door."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to leave, but Osborne called out, "Hold on, sir! Wait a sec!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
