  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! How is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro gasped as he peered into the Dimensional Bag, his face a mix of astonishment and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reaction sent a wave of alarm through the gathered family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's wrong? What's got you so shaken?" Zachary asked urgently, his eyes wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time he had seen Jethro so flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro didn't respond immediately; he just inhaled sharply, his expression shifting between shock and delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, with a bittersweet smile, he handed the Dimensional Bag to Zachary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to see this for yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiosity piqued, Zachary took the bag and delved into it with his soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, his eyes popped wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's earlier astonishment ignited the curiosity of everyone around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That Dimensional Bag had been left to Jethro by Osborne&mdash;what could possibly be inside that had both of them so stunned?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd closed in, all eager to glimpse the contents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One gasp after another filled the air as Osborne's aunts and uncles examined the contents of the Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each revelation led to more shock&mdash;the amount of Essence Crystals inside was simply staggering!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many is this?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least two million Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two hundred million Ultimate Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And a hundred Miracle Elixirs! Most of them are white Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did Osborne manage to leave us all this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he really gift us so many Ultimate Essence Crystals, Celestial Crystals, and Miracle Elixirs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This silly kid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire family was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at their peak, the Hudson family treasury had never boasted such an abundance of Ultimate Essence Crystals, Celestial Crystals, or Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this haul, their concerns over Essence Crystals would vanish, and some of them could even aim for the Supernal Deity King rank!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With gravitas, Jethro finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to secure this! This is a gift for us from Osborne. We'll distribute it fairly later. And I want you all to remember, treat Osborne well. If anyone mistreats him, just wait and see how I handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed wistfully, "My grandson is both mysterious and full of surprises! I can't shake this feeling that the next time I see him, he's going to blow my mind again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family nodded in agreement, feeling a mix of pride and excitement for Osborne's unexpected generosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was already over six million miles away, embarking on his next adventure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne whispered to himself, "Grandpa will be so surprised when he sees the Dimensional Bag! With those Celestial Crystals, the Hudson family should have a much easier time ahead! For now, this is all I can do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the map, and with the detailed military map in hand, Osborne felt ready to embark on his interdimensional travels without the fear of stumbling into dangerous territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he contemplated his next route, he thought, "The West Zone has ten divine peaks, and the closest one is Apocalypse Divine Peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since the West Zone is under the control of the Human Community, and they source most of their Miracle Elixirs from those divine peaks, I'll hold off on searching there for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, I'll head to the South Zone, North Zone, East Zone, and Central Zone, which are under Lord Malevolence's control. If I gather enough Miracle Elixirs, I might not even need to go to the West Zone's divine peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>South Zone it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a clear direction in mind, he declared, "My first target is South Zone's Divine Peak Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's about 1.2 billion miles away. Luckily, with my spatial power and this military map, I can pull off interdimensional travel and get there in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time he performed interdimensional travel, he could cover a distance of 6 million miles, meaning reaching his destination would only take around 200 jumps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from pausing briefly to restore his divine power along the way, he wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By morning, Osborne had been in Apocalypse City in the West Zone with the Hudson family's estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just around noon, he found himself near South Zone's Divine Peak Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating Satan's Eye, he gazed at South Zone's Divine Peak Ten from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks pretty similar to East Zone's Divine Peak Nine," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Osborne couldn't resist peering deeper into the core of the divine peak. He was curious to see if there was any difference between South Zone's Divine Peak Ten and East Zone's Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw left him stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep within South Zone's Divine Peak Ten's core stood another massive humanoid statue, similarly entwined by gigantic tree roots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "How is this possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is every divine peak's core like this? Shadow Terror Fiends? Root creatures? What exactly are they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do they really exist, or are they just projections?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it looks like they're in a battle..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was bewildered, but he knew he had to push those thoug</span><span>hts aside for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to focus on gathering Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
