  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne restrained the impulse to rush out and call an urgent meeting, instead focusing on Kendra's ashen face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra looked like a ghost, visibly shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happened to Bryce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was no ordinary warrior. He led the </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain pirate crew, boasting over 8,000 pirates&mdash;all Class A or higher. They ruled a vast stretch of ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Godson Rankings, Bryce had always ranked in the top ten, but that was before he'd broken through to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea that even someone like Bryce could be in danger was unnerving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he knew Bryce was in trouble, Osborne couldn't just walk away; he needed to dig deeper and see if he could help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He owed Bryce a debt of gratitude; Bryce had saved Osborne's life not once but twice during his early, vulnerable days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could die if not for Bryce&rsquo;s help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Bryce&rsquo;s in trouble, he wouldn't stand idly by if he could help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly is happening?!" Osborne raised his voice, stepping closer to Kendra and patting her shoulder gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra was once a girl brimming with boundless optimism and a zest for life, sometimes a funny one. She had an insatiable thirst for adventure and play, so much so that she went to great lengths to sneak out, even disguising her true capabilities. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, this playful charade backfired when she was captured by pirates and confined in a cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Osborne intervened and rescued her from the cage. From that moment on, she decided to stay by Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been full of laughter, always sharing jokes with Yulissa and Queenie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, her face was pale; her body trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth from Osborne's hand seemed to snap her back to reality, but her worry was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Osborne, something's happened to my brother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A huge group from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> attacked </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain! Everyone is dead! My brother was severely injured and being chased by several Class S warriors. I don't even know where he is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will he... will he die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to go save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she made a move to leave, but Osborne firmly grasped her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Kendra, hold on a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over a thousand miles to </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain. Even if you take off now, you couldn&rsquo;t catch them! Besides, the ones coming after him are Class S! There's more than one! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What can you really do out there? Can you even save him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you find him, you might just become his burden!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra froze, her face paler. "What... what should we do then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll figure something out," Osborne declared, his expression hardening with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, he had received the alarming news of a full-scale attack by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Its elite forces had appeared in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, and other coastal provinces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This onslaught was unlike previous ones; the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was dismantling all the major powers along its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether Ancient Families or hidden super-forces, no one was spared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> wasn't just making a power play against the Augustine family or the Draco Group; It aimed to dominate the entire </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every superpower within those borders would either bend the knee or be ruthlessly killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne's hunch was right, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> would conquer province after province until it had complete control over </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, forcing every superpower to submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, it would reach Newport City for a final showdown with the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant, for the moment, the Augustine family was safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Then I have to go save Bryce! He saved my life before; now he's in danger, and I can't just stand by!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Kendra. "I'll go with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your powers can track him, right? You can sense his energy? Just lead the way, and I'll help you find him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's eyes lit up with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears brimmed in her eyes as she looked at Osborne. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Osborne! Thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, waving his hand dismissively, "Let's move! We don't have a moment to waste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was being hunted down by a group of Class S warriors. If Osborne guessed correctly, they were likely a squad of Class S clones. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Bryce was a prodigy, having just broken into Class S, he had given the Trident of Poseidon to Clarissa, leaving him without his most effective weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with a group of Class S opponents, his chances of holding out were slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't act fast, they might be too late to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" Osborne said, slicing through the air to open a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Kendra's hand and they left.</span></p><div class="pagination">
