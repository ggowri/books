  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "Mr. Pollitt, how's Mr. Lachlan Swift holding up? Do you have any ideas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, only Darren had once been a Deity Overlord warrior, making him the most qualified to assess this battle that left the others bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was grave as he watched Osborne deftly evade Fabian's attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had told Osborne about the Wild Bull Clan's weaknesses regarding speed and agility, but he never imagined Osborne would actually exploit that weakness so effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne's rank was still too low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren had seen peak Celestial Deity warriors toy with Wild Bull Clan Deity Overlords, but never had he witnessed someone who had just broken into the Celestial Deity realm outmaneuvering a Deity Overlord like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was nothing short of astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he knew that Osborne was still only a Superior Deity, not even a Transcendent Deity yet, his shock might have turned to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren didn't respond to Betty right away; he was fixated on Osborne, who was executing his speed technique with remarkable finesse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally said, his voice filled with awe, "It's truly impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift is using his speed to toy with a Deity Overlord like Fabian right after breaking through to the Celestial Deity realm. I've never seen anything like it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I share the same concerns as everyone else. Such a speed technique is bound to drain a lot of divine power. For a typical early Celestial Deity, sustaining that for five minutes is already impressive. Ten minutes? That's a prodigy, a real freak of nature!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Mr. Lachlan Swift is in danger, and it's coming up fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a wave of shock through Betty and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do? Shouldn't we jump in and help Mr. Lachlan Swift? Even if we die, we can at least buy him some time to recover!" Betty clenched her fists, determination written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren quickly shook his head. "No! Remember Mr. Lachlan Swift's instructions. We can't go against his orders. Jumping in could just complicate things for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, we have to trust that he has some tricks up his sleeve that we don't know about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a hint of emotion crept into Darren's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, it feels like we're the ones holding Mr. Lachlan Swift back. With the speed he's showing now, if it weren't for us, he could have just bolted. Even a Deity Overlord like Fabian wouldn't be able to catch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's staying here to tangle with Fabian because he knows if he runs, Fabian will turn on us. The other factions nearby would seize that opportunity and come after us, leaving us to fend for ourselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift is incredibly loyal! We haven't contributed anything to him, yet he's fighting for us against a Deity Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's lips pressed together tightly, his resolve hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty, her sisters, and the rest of Spark of Blaze bit their lips, their hearts swelling with emotion as they watched Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had the speed to escape Fabian, yet he chose to stay and fight for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not be moved by such selflessness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren exclaimed, his gaze fixed on the unfolding battle, "I'm not letting you take action for a reason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift didn't choose to run away, which means he must have something else up his sleeve! Perhaps he has other cards to play that can address our concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We just need to watch and wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it comes down to it, and Mr. Lachlan Swift can't hold his ground, we'll step in. We'll risk our lives to buy him time to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we fall, I'm sure Mr. Lachlan Swift will avenge us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Darren returned his attention to the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian and Osborne were locked in a high-speed chase, moving like streaks of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of relief. He had managed to master the Thunderform Flash to an initiate mastery level; otherwise, he would have never been able to toy with Fabian at this speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, "Fabian clearly knows that the Wild Bull Clan's Achilles' heel is speed. He's gone out of his way to learn some kind of secret technique to double his speed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't trained Thunderform Flash to this level, he might have actually caught up to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes had passed, yet Osborne's divine power showed no signs of waning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He maintained his pace effortlessly, leaving Fabian struggling to even brush against his cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration bubbled in Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your divine power is impressive, I'll give you that! But how long can you keep this up? Three minutes? Five?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, his demeanor calm. "Who are you looking down on? I can hold out until you decide to throw in the towel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian burst into laughter, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, come on! Don't kid yourself. A speed technique like yours, even a peak Celestial Deity warrior wouldn't last long! I, on the other hand, can keep this level of intensity going until I take you down! You're as good as dead!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
