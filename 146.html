Now, with a chance to earn good money, Osborne chose ordinary bodyguards over Harris, who was more capable and a deputy, no less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris was convinced that Osborne was deliberately targeting and sidelining him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's bodyguard squad consisted of four distinct groups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bodyguard Unit One was personally led by Osborne, but its members had not been fully recruited, so none of its members had joined the raid team, which Harris thought was normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when it came to Bodyguard Units Three and Four, Harris grumbled about why their entire teams got to join.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no one from his Bodyguard Unit Two joining the assault team, they couldn't earn the three million dollars, leaving him to ponder how to account for this to his members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris exclaimed inwardly, "Very well then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You're trying to sideline me, huh, Osborne? If that's how you want to play, don't blame me for what comes next!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris frowned, his face darkening with murderous intent, but he kept his head down and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna declared firmly, "It's decided then. This raid is extremely important. I hope everyone can work together. Whoever brings in Raymond alive will be generously rewarded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What time will we act, Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tonight," Osborne replied. "I will arrange for the raid team members to leave Radcliffe Manor in batches and wait for orders outside the slums in the south of the city to avoid arousing suspicion. The specific time of the operation will be as per my notification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, go and get ready everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharon and Violet nodded in agreement and cheerfully went off to prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't know yet that Osborne had become the new head of Skyefall Security Services, but he had given this chance to all the members of Bodyguard Units Three and Four, and they were very grateful to him. After all, this mission alone could earn them three million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after splitting with the company, each of them could still get nearly two million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most of them, this was more than they made in a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what about the risks, you might ask?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guarding Clarissa was already a risky job. Otherwise, why would the Radcliffe family have paid so much? Whether it was guarding her or taking the offensive against Raymond, it made no difference to them. As long as they got paid well, they weren't afraid of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they left, only Donna, Clarissa, Barlyn, and Osborne remained in the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'll be outside the slums tonight to back you up. Please be careful. Even if you don't catch Raymond, safety comes first," Clarissa advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was touched to hear her say such caring words with her typically cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and nodded. "Got it, Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Donna watched their interaction, her face darkened slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she said nothing and instead cautioned Barlyn, "Remember, safety comes first tonight. Don't be reckless. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get it, Mom. I'm not a kid anymore," Barlyn replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, the hours slipped by, and it was already nightfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twenty members of Bodyguard Units Three and Four, led by Sharon and Violet, had already discreetly left the Radcliffe Manor. They were fully armed and had gone to the outskirts of the southern slums to lie in wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Barlyn, on the other hand, were also gearing up for their mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armed to the teeth, Osborne and Barlyn got into a car and departed from the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression was full of concern as she watched them leave. "Do you think Barlyn and Osborne will be alright, Aunt Donna? How about we go over there now? I'm worried that something might go wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned. "Don't worry, they won't act that quickly. We'll go to back them up later. Let's hope we can settle things with Raymond once and for all this time. If Osborne does manage to catch Raymond alive, it'll be a great accomplishment for Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that, Clarissa bit her lip hard, feeling deeply touched. She murmured under her breath, "Osborne is doing all this to help me. But I don't seem to have anything to repay him with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say?" Donna asked, not hearing her clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa stammered, "N... Nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne and Barlyn had already arrived outside the slums in the southern part of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the pitch-black, crowded slums with no streetlights in the night, a cold glint flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bodyguard Units Three and Four, what's your status?" He asked through his radio earpiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bodyguard Unit Three is in position, and ready to act at any time, Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bodyguard Unit Four is in position, and ready to act at any time, Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Sharon and Violet responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well. I'll go in first to scout for Raymond's exact location. Keep radio silence until I give the order," Osborne said before opening the car door. "Barlyn, you stay here and wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Barlyn could even respond, Osborne had already disappeared into the darkness, making his way into the slums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne never intended to rely on the raid team to capture Raymond. He was counting on himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to act alone and that once he captured Raymond, he would call the raid team to finish up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered inwardly, "Satan's Eye, activate!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
