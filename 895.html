  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't let him keep winning after reaching a hundred victories. If we do, it'll be a disgrace for all of us. We'll just be stepping stones for him, fueling his unstoppable momentum!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! We have to take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scarlett's already fallen. The only one who might stand a chance against him now is Marlon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's team up and wear him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I might not be able to beat him outright, but I can definitely help drain his strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett had ranked 100th on the Godson Rankings, but there were still twenty-nine others in the younger generation who ranked higher than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from Cuthbert, who had already died but whose fate hadn't yet been announced, all twenty-eight were present and glaring at Osborne with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one wanted to be someone else's stepping stone. With Osborne's hundred victories under his belt, his next target would undoubtedly be conquering the Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In history, only three individuals had ever cleared the Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They absolutely refused to see Osborne become the fourth, as that would mean they would all become mere stepping stones for him, solidifying his undeniable dominance among the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could stomach Osborne achieving a hundred victories, but they would never accept him clearing the Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they banded together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of their affiliations with different superpowers or the countries they hailed from, they gathered to strategize their next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew they had to unite to stop Osborne from clearing the Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's expression was steely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. As long as I'm here, he won't get through the Honor Quest Ceremony! Just give it your all. Even if you can't drain his strength, I'll take him down myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a confident grin spread across Marlon's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement. "We're all in the top hundreds of the Godson Rankings! Even against an ordinary Class S Supreme Overlord, we won't back down easily. We can definitely wear him out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll head to the arena first. We can't let him catch his breath."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a man stepped onto the stage without hesitation, unleashing his full power to keep Osborne from recovering, employing every tactic to sap Osborne's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The challengers that followed were all top-tier Class AAA fighters. With their full effort, defeating them wouldn't be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd have to expend a fair amount of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, these fighters, while formidable, were still a step behind Scarlett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only hope to drain his strength; defeating Osborne seemed nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's winning streak continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a grueling half-hour, Osborne had taken down ten more challengers, pushing his record to an impressive 110 consecutive wins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheers from the Augustine family grew even louder, their faces flushed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Osborne triumphed over a challenger, he was etching a new chapter in history, filling them with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes blazed with fervor as they watched Osborne on the stage, as if witnessing a legend in the making.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew stood there, dumbfounded. "I always had a feeling he could pull off something miraculous, but I never expected him to be this strong! The miracles he's creating are absolutely mind-blowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeing him is like looking at a younger version of the Godfather! No, he's even more dazzling, more legendary than the Godfather ever was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the one who's truly fit to lead the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's words stirred excitement among the members of the Augustine family, who nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Vincent and Owen, who had their grievances with Osborne, felt a surge of pride, their competitive spirits quelled by the sheer might of the man before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone ventured, "Do you think Osborne will defeat all his challengers and clear the Honor Quest Ceremony?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, a ripple of anticipation swept through the group, eyes wide with both hope and trepidation. The thought seemed almost too grand to entertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb chimed in, shaking his head, "It's going to be tough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is incredibly strong&mdash;stronger than any of us ever expected. He's definitely got the chops to break into the top twenty of the Godson Rankings, maybe even the top ten! In a one-on-one, I'd bet he could hold his own against Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But here's the kicker: the Honor Quest Ceremony isn't a fair fight. If Osborne wants to take on Marlon, he'll first have to go through at least a dozen top-tier Class AAA </span><span>fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These guys might not be quite as strong as Osborne, but they're not far off. Even if he beats them, he's going to be drained. By the time he faces Marlon, he'll be lucky to have half his strength left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Honestly, Osborne has no chance to make it through the Honor Quest Ceremony.</span><span>"</span></p><div class="pagination">
