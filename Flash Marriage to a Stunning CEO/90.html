        <h1>Chapter 90 Hug Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the afternoon, Alistair picked up Eloise, and they headed to Mabel's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When facing the kind-hearted Mabel again, Alistair was in a completely different state of mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He now took Mabel's kindness for granted more than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And when it came to showing filial piety to Mabel, he did it with full justification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dinner, as the evening fell and the sky darkened, it started to drizzle outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel insisted they stay overnight because of the bad weather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel took on the task of telling Eloise bedtime stories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she urged the young couple to wash up and go to bed quickly. "Don't stay up late just because you're young. It's bad for your health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel had a special room for Caroline. It was a bit larger than the one they currently lived in, and decorated in a simple yet elegant style, clearly tailored to Caroline's taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a big terrace facing the south.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stood on the terrace, watching the raindrops hit the banana leaves for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moist wind, carrying the fragrance of flowers, grass, and earth, blew toward him. He took a deep breath, feeling refreshed and content, before returning to the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline, fresh from the shower, sat on the sofa, radiating warmth. She thrust the hair dryer at Alistair without a hint of hesitation. "Come here and dry my hair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair took a seat beside her. Amid the gentle hum of the hair dryer, he tenderly lifted her damp tresses and began to dry them with utmost care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Caroline casually grabbed a pillow and hugged it tightly. Her bare forearm was so smooth that it seemed to emit a soft glow in the dim light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alistair lifted her long, flowing hair, the warm air from the dryer cascaded through the strands, caressing her scalp with a comforting warmth. The gentle breeze that followed ruffled the collar of her pajamas, creating a subtle, fluttering effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like a contented cat being stroked, she closed her eyes, surrendering to the pure bliss of the moment. Before long, her eyelids grew heavy. Once she felt that her hair was almost dry, Caroline slumped against Alistair, wearing a mischievous smile on her face, as if she had drifted into a light slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair gently tucked a wisp of her slightly puffy, now-dry hair behind her ear. As he saw her smug little expression, a mischievous glint appeared in his eyes. Before she could even react, he wrapped his strong arms around her waist and hoisted her up into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's feet suddenly left the ground, and in a moment of panic, she instinctively wrapped her arms tightly around his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without uttering a single word, Alistair strode purposefully toward the perfectly smooth bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline swallowed hard, her mind racing with thoughts of what might happen next.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh no, did I go too far? But I didn't do anything actually. I just thought he was being so sweet, and I wanted to have a bit of fun...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair leaned down, a soft smile on his face, and gently laid Caroline on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was a bundle of nerves, but she wasn't about to let it show. Looking up at him with her big, clear eyes, she managed to say in a surprisingly steady voice, "You haven't taken a shower yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair tenderly brushed a stray lock of hair from her eyes and murmured, "Yeah." Then he pulled the quilt over her, straightened up, and sauntered away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he was gone, Caroline buried herself under the quilt and started rolling around on the king-sized bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, she was silently freaking out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had zero experience in situations like this, and her heart was a whirlwind of nervousness and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the bathroom, Alistair deliberately turned the water temperature down a few degrees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time he finished his shower, all those distracting thoughts had fled his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kept reminding himself that Caroline was a patient, and it would be downright cruel to take advantage of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he came out, the main light in the bedroom was off, and only the bedside lamp cast a warm, orange glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had tucked herself under the quilt, leaving only her head exposed. Her hair was in disarray on the white pillow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair pinched himself lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ouch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Stop doubting. This isn't a dream. Caroline is my legitimate wife!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tiptoed onto the bed and settled in beside Caroline. Reaching over, he grabbed the other corner of the quilt and pulled it over himself. Then, he switched off the bedside lamp and snuggled deep into the warm, plush covers. The room was filled with a calming, delicate fragrance that seemed to soothe his very soul. Alistair closed his eyes contentedly, feeling as if he'd just stepped into paradise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even thought that if he were to pass away right then, he'd have no complaints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was lying on her side, her back turned to him. Even though they weren't touching, she could feel the heat radiating from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first time they'd shared a quilt so openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were so close that the slightest twitch from either of them would end up with their bodies making contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After clearing his mind of all the distractions, Alistair was in a state of pure bliss and soon drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some time later, a leg accidentally brushed against his, and Alistair jolted awake with a start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline hadn't caught a wink of sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nervously and with a silent yearning, she'd waited for Alistair to finish his nightly routine and join her in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd been secretly hoping he'd make a move on her, her heart fluttering in anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier that day, when Alistair had tried to kiss her, she'd come up with a seemingly reasonable excuse to turn him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In reality, she'd just been overcome by shyness. To be honest, she'd regretted it as soon as it was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was worried about passing the virus on to Alistair, yet at the same time, she didn't want to cool his eagerness to get close to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alistair got into bed without making any further advances, anxiety welled up inside her.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Did I kill his mood?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wondered silently, rueing her earlier decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sleep simply eluded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I want to sleep in Alistair's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's my real husband. Why should I let this chance slip away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Caroline had sorted out her thoughts, a sense of determination washed over her. Without a shred of guilt about waking Alistair, she boldly rolled over and said, "I'm freezing. Hug me."</span></p></div>
