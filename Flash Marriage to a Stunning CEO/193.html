        <h1>Chapter 193 Secret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair said to Eloise gently, "Go and watch some cartoons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise obediently replied, "Okay," then hopped off the sofa and scurried away with quick little steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alistair joined the family, Eloise was a timid and introverted girl, terribly afraid of strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she had become much more lively and outgoing, thanks to the sense of security they'd given her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl was quite sensible. Knowing that her dad was going to have a chat with her uncle, she ran back to the study to watch cartoons on her tablet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she ran, her little pigtails bounced up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's eyes followed her all the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave a soft cough and offered Leo a coffee cup, saying, "Have some coffee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo quickly averted his gaze and pretended to say casually, "What a cute little girl! I saw her when she was a baby. She was crying so hard that her whole face turned red..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, he suddenly paused, and a look of regret flashed across his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair guessed that Leo might be regretting that if Eloise hadn't been crying then, he might have noticed the connection between this little girl and his first love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what difference would it make?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His first love was never coming back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he could make up for his debts to her through Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo hunched over and blew gently on his coffee. Alistair noticed that his eyes were bloodshot, as if they were on the verge of bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were sharp-witted. Leo had probably deduced Eloise's real identity and was aware that Alistair knew he had caught on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he could sit there so composed, not even bothering to mask the sorrow that was etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a voice slightly thick with emotion, but still managing a smile, Leo asked, "Is her name Eloise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, emotions could be like a potent virus, spreading from one person to another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair could feel the heavy cloud of sadness hanging over Leo, and it cast a bit of a shadow over his own mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair explained where the name came from, "Yeah, Carol named her. When Carol adopted her, she was always wailing. So Carol picked this name, hoping she'd grow up brave and tough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo mumbled dreamily, "Eloise, Eloise..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that something was about to well up and spill over from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dropped his head, and a single tear trickled down. Then he smiled and said in an even tone, "It's a beautiful name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, a long silence settled over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them uttered a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stand still. Before they knew it, the hot coffee in the cup had gone cold. Leo leaned his head back and downed it in one go, with the same bravado as if he were knocking back a shot of strong liquor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wiped his face, then got to his feet and turned his back to Alistair. "I've got some business to take care of. I'll head off first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after Leo left, Caroline came home from work. Eloise immediately piped up, telling her that her cousin had dropped by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline gently stroked Eloise's head. The servants had already set the dinner table, and it was almost time to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Eloise took her seat and the servant helped her put on the bib, she said, "Mom, did something bad happen to that uncle? He looked so down in the dumps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline replied, "Maybe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise asked with a worried look on her face, "Will someone be there to cheer him up when he gets home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline glanced at Alistair and then asked Eloise, "Are you worried about your uncle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise said firmly, "He's our family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline smiled, "Don't worry. He'll be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise just nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Caroline joked, "How about going to his place to comfort him? You're our little angel, and your comfort will surely cheer him up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise shook her head and whispered, "No, Mom. I don't know him well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair interjected, "Your mom is just joking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dinner was served, and Eloise fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't talk with her mouth full and stayed quiet when she was in bed. Little Eloise was the picture of a well-behaved young lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As night descended, Alistair sat in the bathtub, his chin resting gently on Caroline's shoulder. "Do you think Leo'll make it through this rough patch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline snuggled into his arms. Her eyes, which had been closed, fluttered open a bit, and she let out a soft sigh. "I reckon so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he did, he was bound to be in the doldrums for a spell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe only time could help him slowly put this behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sighed sympathetically, "I really feel for the guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you've already said that," Caroline reminded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short pause, Caroline said matter-of-factly, "But his mom probably won't let him mope around for long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair immediately thought of the secrets about Paige that he had uncovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind was in turmoil, and the change in his mood was instantly noticed by Caroline in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline turned around, causing the water in the bathtub to slosh violently and spill over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cupped Alistair's face with both hands and gently massaged his eyes with her fingertips. "Honey, what on earth did you dream about last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, when Alistair went through Paige's secrets, he was shocked to find many things related to Caroline. He realized that his suspicions were right; Caroline was indeed the child from the second-floor room!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair regretted it deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only he had known earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But was there really such a thing as "if only" in the world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everyone knew everything in advance, the world would be in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Alistair thought that the man he met during his special investigation must have been sent by Caroline. That man deliberately misled him so that he wouldn't discover the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Alistair decided to pretend he didn't know, since he couldn't reveal how he got the information anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from imprisoning and trying to tame Caroline, Paige had also done other shady things. For instance, the rift in Gordon's marriage was also orchestrated by Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Paige was the one responsible for Caroline's unhappy childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had not only hurt Caroline but also Gordon and Caroline's mother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was so furious last night that after Caroline fell asleep, he quietly got out of bed and went to the balcony. He punched the air with his self-invented boxing moves, wishing he could rush over right away and wring the neck of that woman whose controlling nature had driven her insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon Alistair calmed down. He held the reins of the overall situation now, and he had to stay calm and not act impulsively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his emotions were still all over the place. Torn between his concern for Caroline and seething rage, he found it nearly impossible to drift off to sleep. In the end, he was in a half-daze, not even sure if he'd actually managed to catch any shut-eye. His mind raced on, constantly churning over how he could use those secrets against Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A day went by, and Alistair thought he'd finally managed to calm down. But the moment he let his mind wander back to it, his emotions flared right back up. His heart ached, and an uncontrollable anger welled up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in his hazy dreams, he was constantly being pulled between these two extreme feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, after a day of racking his sleep-deprived brain, he'd come up with a plan to deal with Paige.</span></p></div>
