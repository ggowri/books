        <h1>Chapter 85 Two Kids' Fight</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise had an accident on her last day at Angel's Garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angel's Garden was an expensive, aristocratic kindergarten. The children who studied there were either rich or from noble families. So the teachers treated each child with great care, for fear of making the slightest mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Eloise's first day of admission, she received a high-standard reception personally from the principal, Gina Morris. This was enough to prove that her family background was far superior to that of the other children. Naturally, the teachers paid great attention to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The teachers didn't expect that, just during the time when they went to get a glass of water, Eloise, who was doodling and playing at the table with Zoe, was pushed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing the little girl's heart-rending cry, the teachers' hands trembled, and the water in the glasses spilled all over the floor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise's teacher, Phyllis Duncan, rushed out in a hurry. She found Eloise lying on the ground, but it was Zoe, who was scared out of her wits, who was crying, not Eloise. Due to this sudden accident, Eloise was so stunned that she even forgot to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The boy who pushed her wasn't from Phyllis' class. He angrily shouted at Eloise, "You have no shame. Since you don't have a father of your own, you want to steal mine. Give my father back to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise was taken aback for a moment. Then she immediately got up from the ground and shouted back defiantly, "You're talking nonsense! My father is my father, not your father. And I didn't steal him either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was usually soft and sweet. Besides, she was a little shorter and thinner than Daniel. But at this moment, her imposing manner was not weak at all. She clenched her little fists tightly. If Daniel said one more word of nonsense, she would pounce on him and hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was scared to death inside, but she couldn't show it. In Eloise's heart, if she showed her fear, her father would be taken away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was her father, and she wouldn't give him to other children, especially to the naughty kid who liked to push others!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel was furious and said, "Since you don't have a father of your own, you want to steal mine! None of you should play with her. She likes to steal other people's fathers. One day, she will steal all your fathers and make you all children without fathers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other children shrank to the side timidly, looking at each other, and no one dared to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time when Phyllis rushed over, Maggie from Daniel's class also rushed in and said anxiously, "Daniel, why did you come here? Come back with me quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel pointed at Eloise and said, "She's stealing my father. She's a shameless and naughty kid! I want to beat her to death. If she's dead, no one will steal my father from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phyllis was terrified when she heard this. The children here were all born with a silver spoon in their mouths. If Eloise's parents heard these words, a dispute would be inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So Phyllis couldn't help scolding, "Watch what you're saying. If you beat someone to death, you'll go to jail. If you keep talking nonsense, I'll call the police and let them arrest you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phyllis didn't understand the quarrel between Daniel and Eloise about their fathers, but Maggie knew something about the inside story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been shocked by Daniel's new father and old father theory before, and then she saw Alistair several times at the gate of the kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maggie noticed that Alistair was sending a little girl to school, and that little girl called him Dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel's father was Alistair at first. Later, Alistair divorced Daniel's mother, and Daniel immediately got a new father. The key point was that the new father was his biological father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Alistair soon had a daughter who was the same age as Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more Maggie thought about it, the more she felt that everything was extremely chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Daniel, who had been crying and insisting on his biological father not long ago, was running over to argue with Alistair's current daughter about their father. This was really puzzling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel wouldn't give up until he achieved his goal, and he started howling at the top of his lungs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise was a lovely little lady. She didn't cry at all. She pursed her small mouth and stared fixedly at Daniel, as if, as long as she watched closely, Daniel wouldn't have the chance to steal her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This went beyond the normal scope of play among children, so the teachers separately contacted their parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phyllis originally wanted to contact Alistair. Generally speaking, the teacher preferred to contact the parent who took care of the child more often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took out her phone, and under Maggie's reminder, she finally contacted Eloise's mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maggie wasn't sure if what she did was right or not. But she felt that Alistair probably wouldn't want to meet Daniel's parents. Moreover, he was the focus of the dispute between the two children, and if he was involved, it might backfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Maggie's side, she naturally contacted Daniel's mother, Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Rebecca received the call, she rushed to the kindergarten in a fit of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation was too complicated to explain clearly over the phone. Maggie just said that Daniel had a conflict with other children in the kindergarten and asked her to come and deal with it as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had forgotten the incident that Daniel had been wailing about and making her extremely angry in the morning. At this moment, all she could think about was that her son had been bullied, and she had to stand up for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After pushing open the door of Gina's office, through her big sunglasses, Rebecca saw her son, who was lowering his head and picking at his fingers at a glance, and she immediately became furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought the kindergarten was really too much. These teachers left her son standing there all alone, looking like a criminal, and they didn't even come over to hug or comfort him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Daniel saw Rebecca, he pouted and threw himself at her in grief. "Mom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca took off her sunglasses, patted his back affectionately, and comforted him, "Don't worry. With me here, I won't let anyone bully you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, she looked around and said coldly, "Where's that little jerk who bullied my son?"</span></p></div>
