        <h1>Chapter 100 Team Up</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both Vivienne and Anne were Rebecca's close friends. If it were Vivienne, Alistair would stop and exchange a few polite words with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when it comes to Anne, just ignoring her was already the best he could do in terms of being polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne was very much like Rebecca. In Alistair's book of the most loathed women, Rebecca took the top spot, with Celeste and Anne coming in second and third, respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne was a woman with no moral standards and absolutely no boundaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just the thought of how she used to act all cutesy and flirtatious with him, thinking she was so alluring, made Alistair want to gag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Alistair was well aware that in the eyes of a rich, flighty girl like her, he was nothing more than a plaything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hoped that her so-called "friendship" with Rebecca would last forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise peeked out from behind Alistair and whispered to him, "Daddy, this madam is so mean. Should we call Mommy to come and help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair couldn't suppress a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was generally a man of few words, which made some people, like Liam, Celeste, and Anne right here, think he was an easy mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has Eloise also got the idea that "anyone can push Daddy around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That won't do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In Eloise's eyes, I'm even more powerful than Superman. I've got to let her know that no matter what difficulties we encounter or what kind of people we run into, I'll be a solid wall protecting her and her mommy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to Anne, a half-smile on his face. "What, are you miffed that my daughter made you sound old? If you admit that your IQ is lower than a three-year-old's, I'll ask my daughter to call you little sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he bent down and gently said to Eloise, "Eloise, go ahead and call her little sister. It'll make her look younger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise blinked her big, innocent eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stole a glance at the scowling Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She's so mean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She's not even a fraction as good as my mom. Humph!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Anne shot her a glare, Eloise shrank her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Daddy says to call, I'll call! I'll do what Daddy says!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she spoke up clearly, "Little sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair smiled and gave Eloise a thumbs-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise beamed sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How infuriating! Alistair is making a mockery of me, hinting that my IQ is only as high as a three-year-old's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne's face flared up with rage. "Alistair, quit showing off. I'm gonna go back and tell Rebecca about this. I'll make sure she gives you the cold shoulder from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair, truth be told, was hoping for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said earnestly, "Is that really possible? Well, thanks then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise, always eager to be a good-mannered little girl, politely chimed in, "Thank you, madam."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair bent down and gently chided her, "Already forgot, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise quickly nodded, then with a sugary smile, repeated, "Thank you, little sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alistair took her hand and led her away, Eloise waved and called out, "Bye-bye, little sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When it came to teaming up with Alistair to rile people up, Eloise seemed to have a natural knack for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne, on the other hand, was fuming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was so mad she could have ripped someone to shreds. She was on the verge of losing it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a good-looking young guy around Alistair's age stepped out of the high-end men's clothing store behind them. "What's going on, honey?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Anne transformed from an enraged shrew into a fragile, pitiful damsel. She threw herself into the man's arms and sobbed, "Waa, someone just picked on me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man looked around, eyes blazing. "Where are they? I'll teach them a proper lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With someone to back her up, Anne immediately dragged the young man in pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But all they caught sight of was the rear of a Maybach speeding off into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The one who bullied you was in that car? If he hadn't run so fast, I'd have really given him a hard time today!" the young man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After sizing up Alistair's clothes and his ride, Anne realized that the patron Alistair had latched onto had really deep pockets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without knowing who that backer was, she didn't dare to provoke Alistair casually, fearing she'd bring trouble upon herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure, she usually acted all high-and-mighty and didn't give Alistair the time of day, but that was because Alistair used to be a penniless bum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Relieved that Alistair had disappeared into the distance, Anne stomped her foot in feigned defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He was lucky to run off so fast. Otherwise, I'd make his life a living nightmare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she turned to the young man by her side. "Come on, honey. How did those clothes fit you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man, Caleb, stood there like a rooted tree, his eyes filled with a trace of melancholy and a thousand thoughts churning in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne, being perceptive, immediately picked up on his off-mood. "What's going on with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb forced a smile and waved it off. "It's nothing, really."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne came to a halt, folded her arms across her chest, and stared at him intently. "Caleb, do you love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb started fidgeting nervously. "Baby, how can you even doubt that? My heart's all yours. Of course, I love you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne was content with Caleb's affirmation of love. "Then don't keep secrets from me. I deserve to know what's going on," she insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb hemmed and hawed for what felt like an eternity. "I got a call from Dad today. Mom's sick and needs surgery. It's gonna cost an arm and a leg, and my family can't just whip up that kind of cash overnight..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne simply brushed it off with a wave of her hand. "You say you love me, but why didn't you tell me sooner? If you're strapped for cash, I'll fork it over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb looked a bit sheepish. "But it's a huge sum... I don't wanna take your money. It'd make me feel like a mooch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be so distant with me!" Anne huffed, stamping her foot in irritation, "Money's nothing compared to true love! So, how much do you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb hung his head, a mix of shame and desperation on his face. "Five million dollars..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Five million dollars was no chump change. It was her entire annual allowance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Anne had a hidden nest-egg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne said nonchalantly, "Is that all? I'll give it to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb was over the moon with gratitude. "Baby, don't worry. This is a loan. Once I'm raking in the dough, I'll pay you back with interest&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop right there. Don't ever say that again! There's no yours or mine. From now on, what's mine is yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb was secretly thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help thinking about Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't forgotten how Alistair was sold by his father for two million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He gave up his SAT chance and his future for just two million dollars, while I just had to open my mouth, and my rich girlfriend handed me five million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair will never catch up with me!</span></p></div>
