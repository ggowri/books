        <h1>Chapter 29 The Resentful CEO</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thanks to Rebecca, Alistair&mdash;at the young age of twenty-four, in the prime of his life&mdash;had no desire for sweet romance, let alone marriage and children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He lived as ascetically as a monk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had resolved to spend the rest of his days alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At least, that was his current mindset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet, contradictorily, he still yearned for the warmth of family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline saw straight through him, reading the desolation in his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is perfect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Since he has no interest in women, being this close gives me an advantage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's only the beginning&mdash;there's still a long way to go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline silently vowed to succeed in breaking into Alistair's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For now, she decided not to overanalyze why she was so inexplicably drawn to him.<br>I'll figure it out eventually. For now, I'll follow my instincts&mdash;I want to indulge myself just this once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though Alistair had no romantic desires, he was still a young man in his prime. The deep night, the quiet space filled with a faint, intoxicating fragrance, and the presence of a soft, alluring beauty&mdash;even as a gentleman with no untoward impulses, he couldn't help but feel slightly unsettled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For the first time, he wished Eloise hadn't gone to bed so early. With her around, he'd feel much more at ease in Caroline's presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That marriage certificate hadn't changed his status as an employee. No matter how awkward he felt, he had to endure his boss' questioning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The problem was that he wasn't much of a talker. After discussing Eloise, he had no idea what else to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline sipped her water, lost in thought, while Alistair sat stiffly across from her, barely daring to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's getting late. Let's call it a night." Caroline finished her water and stood first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair exhaled in relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she passed him, Caroline suddenly stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair nearly bumped into her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His gaze accidentally slipped past her collar, catching a glimpse of smooth skin and delicate collarbones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lower, the fabric of her sleepwear obscured the view, but the soft, perfect curves beneath were still faintly outlined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair quickly averted his eyes. Even though he hadn't seen anything explicit, he still felt guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, right. Every Saturday, I take Eloise to visit my grandmother. You should come with us tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline remained oblivious to his discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair nodded. "Of course."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She turned to face him fully, her tone playful. "Then, Mr. Harlow, I'll be counting on your cooperation tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No problem."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Good. Well then, goodnight. Sweet dreams."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline pushed open her bedroom door and stepped inside&mdash;only to reappear two seconds later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She fixed Alistair with a stare so full of quiet resentment that he nearly took a step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His hand already on his own doorknob, Alistair asked, "Is there something else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," Caroline huffed. "I said goodnight to you. Shouldn't you return the courtesy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair flushed. "Sorry, I forgot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's fine. I forgive you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't help but smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ms. CEO is surprisingly easygoing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline continued staring at him expectantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a brief moment of confusion, Alistair caught on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Goodnight. Sweet dreams."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline muttered, "That's more like it," before finally retreating into her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair entered his own bedroom, closed the door behind him, and stood there for a long moment before suddenly laughing to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The icy CEO can actually be kind of cute in private.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He washed up, changed into soft pajamas, and flopped onto the plush bed, closing his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two seconds later, they snapped open again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Caroline invited me to her grandmother's place. Does that mean I might meet a lot of her relatives?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard received a call from Rebecca, instructing him to pick up Daniel and head straight to Whitfield Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd been irritated by her earlier reluctance to make their relationship public, but this call lifted his spirits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I knew Rebecca wouldn't keep me hidden forever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His plan was simple&mdash;charm Rebecca's parents, marry her, and take over as heir to Whitfield Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They only have one daughter. Eventually, everything the </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Whitfields</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> own will be mine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His good mood peaked when he saw Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd assumed Alistair had been struggling since being kicked out.<br>He must be here to beg for scraps from Rebecca.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Richard hadn't expected that after the peak, there would be a nosedive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">First, Alistair's composed demeanor irritated him.<br>What right does a penniless loser have to act so aloof around me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, his own son still called Alistair "Dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard gritted his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's understandable&mdash;Alistair raised Danny for five years. Of course, the boy would feel attached.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'll just make sure they don't see each other again. Kids forget quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the final straw was realizing Alistair wasn't here to beg&mdash;he'd arrived in a luxury car to pick up another girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Custom-tailored clothes, a high-end vehicle&mdash;far from destitute, Alistair looked like he was thriving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel's lingering attachment to Alistair sent Richard's temper skyrocketing. He roughly hauled the boy into the car and unleashed a torrent of scolding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The once-unruly little demon had become his punching bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you keep crying, I'll tape your mouth shut."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel, frightened by his dark expression, choked back his sobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard saw this as the perfect opportunity to make Daniel forget Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you stupid? He's not your dad. Did you see it? He has a daughter now&mdash;he doesn't want you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel's lips trembled, but one look at Richard's glare silenced him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you don't behave, your mom and I will abandon you too. We'll throw you out on the streets to beg."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrified, Daniel's chubby face turned red, but he didn't dare make a sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only after promising new video games and a trip to the amusement park did Richard finally calm him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When they arrived at Whitfield Manor, Rebecca was nowhere in sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her parents sat on the sofa, their expressions unreadable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A nanny whisked Daniel away, leaving Richard alone with Rebecca's parents in the parlor.</p></div>
