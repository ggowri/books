        <h1>Chapter 26 I'm Serious</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair didn't understand why Rebecca had kept such a major secret from her parents, but he no longer cared. Now that the truth was out, he felt an overwhelming sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment he stepped out of the building, he spotted a familiar luxury car parked by the curb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A glance at the license plate confirmed it was the same one Caroline often used.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does Caroline have business dealings with the Whitfield family?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as the thought crossed his mind, the car window rolled down, revealing Caroline&mdash;her hair tied in a sleek ponytail, gold-framed glasses perched on her nose&mdash;glancing sideways at him. "Get in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once inside, Alistair remarked, "What a coincidence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This isn't a coincidence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You didn't just happen to be passing by."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Of course not," Caroline replied with a smile. "I came to pick you up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her smile was dazzling, leaving Alistair momentarily dazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He averted his gaze, flustered. "I could've taken a cab. You're so busy&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm not that busy right now. Did everything go smoothly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Very smoothly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Good. I'm relieved you weren't mistreated."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her expression told him she meant every word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is she treating me like a child now?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm not Eloise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though amused, he couldn't help but feel touched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No one has cared about me like this since Grandpa passed away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But his gratitude only earned him a frown from Caroline. "Why are you being so formal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"We're husband and wife. Family. You don't need to say thank you," she said naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was once again overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's only been three days since we met.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe she's just worried something might happen to me, leaving Eloise fatherless again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Am I, a grown man, really worth this much concern over such trivial matters?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline dropped Alistair off at home before heading to the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Standing at the curb, Alistair waved goodbye with a smile, watching her car until it disappeared from sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did he realize something felt off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's the difference between me and a doting housewife waiting for her CEO husband to come home?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Focus on driving. If you keep sneaking glances, I'll gouge your eyes out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's eyes never left her laptop, but that didn't stop her from threatening her subordinate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian, her driver and assistant, touched his nose guiltily. "Ms. Ashbourne, you're becoming more tyrannical by the day. Can't I even look at the scenery?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline scoffed, "Scenery? You were practically drilling holes into him with your eyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian defended himself, "Was it that obvious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His curiosity got the better of him. "Who is he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I already told you. He's my husband. Eloise's father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Stop joking around," Julian laughed. "When did you even meet him? How come I didn't know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though Julian had only been Caroline's assistant for two years, their relationship went beyond employer and employee. His father had been the driver for Caroline's grandmother, Mabel, and he had grown up in Ashbourne Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Competent and trustworthy, Julian was like an older brother to Caroline. So when he heard his "little sister" suddenly had a husband, he couldn't stay calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Three days ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What? Three days ago?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You asked when we met. Three days ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And then what? He just became your husband?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian was convinced Caroline was messing with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The usually aloof and reserved Ms. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Ashbourne</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> occasionally shows her humorous side in private.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's eyes glinted with amusement. "That's right. He's my legally certified husband."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How certified are we talking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"We have a marriage license."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian pulled the car over and turned to face her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline met his gaze. "You can't park here. If we get a ticket, you're paying for it out of pocket. No reimbursements."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian ignored her. A few tickets were nothing compared to the bombshell she'd just dropped. "You seriously married him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline sighed and looked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The ever-professional Ms. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Ashbourne</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> actually snuck out during work hours to pick up her husband.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Resting her chin on her hand, she said, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What about Madam Ashbourne&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'll tell her in a couple of days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian sighed too, "I know Madam Ashbourne has been pressuring you lately, but that's just because she cares. You can't just marry some guy you met three days ago to make her happy. What does Eloise think? What's his character like? Is he patient with her? Will he leave you without a second thought?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then he caught himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">With Caroline's status and looks, what man wouldn't be head over heels?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Given the chance, any guy would be on his best behavior around her. Of course, he wouldn't show his flaws.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline shot back, "Do you really think the man I chose would be trash?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian paused. She had a point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Besides, I'm serious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"About what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm serious about him, Julian." Caroline's expression turned solemn. "I'm in this for the long haul."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Before, I was like a spinning top&mdash;busy from the moment I opened my eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now that my last marriage is over, it's like I've been emancipated. My wife actually took time off work to chauffeur me around in a luxury car. I'm not used to this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But that driver of hers was weird. He kept sneaking glances at me like he wanted to dissect me on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When it was time, Alistair went to pick up Eloise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The car used for her school runs was a spacious, comfortable van with a beautiful starry ceiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair didn't have a driver's license, but even if he did, he wouldn't need to drive&mdash;there was a chauffeur for that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he waited outside the kindergarten, someone approached and stood beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man glanced at Alistair and smirked. "Long time no see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair gave him a blank look and replied with a noncommittal "Hmm," clearly uninterested in conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the man, undeterred, continued cheerfully, "Thank you for taking such good care of my wife and son all these years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair smiled, "You're welcome. After all, I had your son call me 'Dad' for several years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's refined, scholarly expression darkened instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though Alistair and Richard had been in different classes during their school days&mdash;one in the international program, the other in the regular stream&mdash;that hadn't stopped them from crossing paths.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And they'd developed a mutual dislike, stemming from a past conflict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair knew Rebecca had chosen him precisely because Richard despised him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, and one more thing," Alistair added sincerely. "Do me a favor and keep your wife in check. Now that we're divorced, it's best if we never cross paths again. So please, make sure she doesn't come looking for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard scoffed, looking smug, "If that's really how you feel, then what are you doing here?"</p></div>
