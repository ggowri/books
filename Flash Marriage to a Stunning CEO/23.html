        <h1>Chapter 23 A Chance</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Rebecca, I've been back for three days now. When can we go see your parents?" Richard asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let's wait a bit longer!" Rebecca blurted out without thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why do we need to wait?" The smile on Richard's face slowly faded. "Rebecca, don't you want to spend your life with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca stared at him helplessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The tender look in Richard's eyes intensified, becoming almost tangible. "Rebecca, let's get married," he said as he pulled an elegant, small velvet box from his pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even without opening it, Rebecca knew exactly what was inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her heart raced with confusion. She didn't understand what was happening to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was the scene she had fantasized about countless times in her mind, yet now that it was actually happening, she inexplicably wanted to run away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She mumbled her excuses. "It's not the right time yet, Rick. Listen to me. My parents still don't know I'm divorced. Let's wait a little longer. I'll tell them soon, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's loving gaze faltered, his expression wounded. "Why do we need to wait? We're going to be together eventually... Rebecca, don't you want to be with me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could she not want to be with Richard? From the first moment she saw him, her entire heart had belonged completely to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She dreamed of marrying him, but the timing wasn't right. That's what she told Richard and what she kept telling herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You don't understand, Rick. Six years ago, my parents were furious when I brought Alistair home to meet them. Especially my dad&mdash;he nearly beat Alistair to death! They wouldn't spare you if they found out you're Danny's real father. I'm only trying to protect you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's expression softened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one understood better than Richard how much Rebecca cared for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Years ago, after their one reckless night together, he'd fled, fearing exposure would ruin his future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though Rebecca resented and hated him for it, she ultimately kept waiting for his return, never giving up hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for Alistair, he was merely a pawn Rebecca used to make Richard jealous. Richard had never considered it necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Rebecca, we have to face this eventually. I can't hide behind you forever," Richard said tenderly, pulling her into his arms. "It's okay. I was the one who made mistakes back then. I love you and will accept whatever punishment comes my way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca nodded distractedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite the sweet words filling her ears, all she could see in her mind was Alistair's face&mdash;his upturned lips and the gentle smile that reached his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After finishing the story, Alistair watched as Eloise drifted off to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He quietly slipped out of her room, only to find Caroline waiting in the hallway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had just showered, her damp hair falling loosely over her shoulders. Her face was bare and flawless, her skin glowing with dewy freshness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's slender frame was practically swimming in her loose white pajama set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment Alistair saw Caroline, he couldn't help but thank goodness she didn't share Rebecca's preference for sexy lace nightgowns. Living under the same roof and running into each other constantly would have been awkward otherwise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet he had lived with Rebecca and her revealing lingerie for six years without feeling uncomfortable. Perhaps that was because, despite Rebecca's stunning curves, Alistair's inherent aversion to her had prevented him from ever seeing her as a woman he could desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is she asleep?" Caroline whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair responded, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You should get some rest, too," Caroline suggested softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair nodded and opened the door to his bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline carefully pushed open Eloise's door and sat on the edge of the bed, gazing tenderly at her peacefully sleeping daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise must have been having pleasant dreams as a sweet smile crossed her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise seemed quite satisfied with the father Caroline had found for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And Caroline herself was equally pleased with the husband she had chosen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If only he would stop being so politely distant with her, everything would be perfect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anne woke up with a pounding headache in the hotel's king-sized bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She reached over to feel the space beside her&mdash;empty and cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Pulling back the covers, she grimaced in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After meeting that incredibly handsome guy last night, why was she still wearing the same sexy outfit she'd worn out for her fun night?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Where had the man gone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She remembered them drinking and talking, hitting it off wonderfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What exactly they'd discussed, however, remained a blur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She just knew they'd talked about many, many things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Later, she'd used her tipsy state as an excuse to collapse against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was the one who'd brought her to the hotel, but everything after that was a blank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">According to how these scenarios typically played out, her drunk self should have ended up in a passionate encounter with him, tearing up the sheets in an epic night of pleasure... Anne shook her head, staring at the room&mdash;messy, yes, but showing no signs of any intimate activities. She was utterly bewildered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Where was her perfect guy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Where was her steamy one-night stand?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline gazed guiltily at her handsome executive assistant in front of her desk. "I'm sorry for what you went through," she said. "Here's something to make up for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian Hart, Caroline's executive assistant, twitched his lips as he looked at Caroline, who was clearly not sincere despite her apology. His expression of utter despair vanished instantly when he spotted the sports car keys gleaming on the polished desk.<br>"Ms. Ashbourne, it would be my honor to walk through fire and climb mountains for you," he gushed. "Nearly losing my virtue was nothing! I'd willingly be cut into a thousand pieces for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">God, that woman last night had been terrifying&mdash;acting like she'd never seen a man before. He would have lost his virtue if he hadn't been quick-witted. The things he endured for this job!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline laughed softly and waved her hand. "Alright, alright. I know you suffered."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Having successfully buttered up Caroline, Julian snatched the car keys and strutted out, delighted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could he not devote himself completely to such a generous employer?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The investigation Caroline had asked Julian to conduct on Rebecca had yielded results.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These findings surprised Caroline tremendously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the same time, she was satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So the child wasn't Alistair's after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It belonged to Rebecca and some guy named Richard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Rebecca...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's eyes darkened with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That woman had used her two million dollars to treat Alistair like less than human for six years, humiliating and ordering him around without restraint. Calling him a slave wouldn't be an exaggeration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline frowned.<br>Just wait until I get the chance. I'll make you pay for what you did to Alistair.</p></div>
