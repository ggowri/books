        <h1>Chapter 130 Cold by Nature</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel's blood pressure shot up like a thermometer plunged </span><span>into boiling water as he watched Rebecca cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't hold back any longer and slapped her across the face. "You idiot! What else are you hiding from us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blow sent Rebecca reeling backward as she clutched her face, sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a few</span><span> slaps could earn Alistair's forgiveness, she'd gladly take more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she'd been young and foolish, treating a worthless man like treasure while treating the one who truly deserved her love like dirt. She'd realized it far too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey? Honey, w</span><span>hat's wrong? Stop crying! Your father's having some kind of attack because of you. Call 911 now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia's panicked screams cut through the air as Rebecca watched Nathaniel collapse to the floor. She hastily wiped away her tears and fumbled for her phone</span><span>, her fingers trembling as she dialed 911.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey! Honey, please be okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ambulance sirens wailed as paramedics rushed Nathaniel onto a stretcher. His eyes were shut tight, his face flushed an alarming shade of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel had literally passed out </span><span>from rage. But he wasn't defending Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What sent him over the edge was realizing just how bold Rebecca had become, casually manipulating other people's lives. If she'd done this, what other ridiculous stunts had she pulled behind their backs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fam</span><span>ily could barely handle one Alistair situation. What if other scandals came to light?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nathaniel thought about his hard-earned career potentially ruined because of his foolish daughter, his anger overwhelmed him, and he collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia followed the</span><span> paramedics in tears as the ambulance drove away with its sirens blaring. Rebecca sat slumped on the floor, one side of her face swollen, looking completely shell-shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel, who hadn't yet found a suitable preschool, wandered over without a care in t</span><span>he world. "Mom, is Grandpa going to die?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Rebecca didn't respond, her eyes vacant and unfocused, he tugged at her hair and repeated, "Mom, is Grandpa really going to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled too hard, yanking out several strands of Rebecca's hair in </span><span>the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca finally turned around. She stared at the boy who looked so much like Richard, her mind in a fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to be so proud that her son resembled his father, always relieved when people could see the clear connection. She had wanted ever</span><span>yone to know this was Richard's biological son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, looking at that face, Rebecca felt a strange, inexplicable disgust rising from deep within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, is Grandpa really dying? Say something! Talk to me!" Daniel yanked at her hair again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca kept he</span><span>r eyes fixed on him. "Danny, do you want your grandfather to get better, or do you want him to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Daniel answered, "I want Grandpa to die. He's too mean. He's always yelling at me. I hate him! If he dies, no one will yell at me anymo</span><span>re!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Daniel was Nathaniel's actual grandson, and Nathaniel only scolded him occasionally when he misbehaved, sometimes giving him stern looks and brief reprimands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one expected 5-year-old Daniel to hold such a grudge, practically wishing</span><span> death on his grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca stared at her son in shock. His face looked completely innocent while he said something so heartless. She felt her blood turn to ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Danny," she whispered, "he's your grandfather, your actual grandfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel </span><span>yanked out a few more strands of her hair, completely unfazed. "I don't want him as my grandfather. I wish he would die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva overheard this from across the room and felt a chill run down her spine. Kids being mischievous at five was normal, but </span><span>saying such cold, heartless things definitely wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca tried one more approach. "But sweetie, your grandpa is my dad. If your grandpa dies, then I won't have a father anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel just opened his little mouth and said, "So what? It's not a big d</span><span>eal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca stared at her son as he played with her long hair between his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hit her suddenly that she had completely failed at raising this child. No, that wasn't quite right. It wasn't her failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was simply born cold-hearted like his fath</span><span>er. He wasn't a good person, deep down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca had gotten pregnant out of wedlock and become the butt of everyone's jokes&mdash;all for this ungrateful, cold-blooded little monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage bubbled up from Rebecca's core. She grabbed Daniel and slapped him hard ac</span><span>ross the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood-curdling screams echoed through the Whitfield Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'll never pull your hair again! I'm sorry! Please stop hitting me!" Daniel cried out. He was clearly due for some discipline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva tried to mind her own business at first, quie</span><span>tly backing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But something about the situation felt wrong as she listened. The kid's cries were getting weaker, but the hitting sounds continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something wasn't right. Eva convinced herself to check what was happening. When she arrived, the scene le</span><span>ft her frozen in horror before she rushed forward in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! You need to stop, Ms. Whitfield! You're going to kill him if you don't stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At two that afternoon, Alistair arrived at the Stellar Films building. He noticed an anime store nearby a</span><span>nd remembered Eloise liked some character from a show. He figured he'd check if they had any merchandise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't get on your knees and apologize to me right now&mdash;and make it convincing&mdash;I'm not only giving her role to someone else, I'll blacklist her </span><span>so she never works in this industry again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hostile voice nearby caught his attention. It sounded strangely familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stopped in his tracks when he spotted a drunk, bald man making a scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Great. It's Brady, the same guy who'd slipped through</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> his fingers last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had never planned to let Brady off the hook, and now that he'd run into him again, he decided to hang back and see what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young couple stood facing Brady, their backs to Alistair so he couldn't make out their</span><span> faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guy had his hair pulled back in a small ponytail and wore a baggy black hoodie with cargo pants, a total artsy type.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him stood a petite girl with straight hair falling loose around her shoulders. She kept her head down, looking complete</span><span>ly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady's face was flushed, his eyes unfocused. He'd clearly knocked back quite a few drinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was pointing at them aggressively, slurring his words, "I'm counting to three. One... two..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up, Mr. Newman," the artsy guy cut in. He turned</span><span> to the girl beside him. "Janice, go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janice Landry's voice broke as she protested, "I'm not leaving. I didn't do anything wrong! He's the one picking on me for no reason."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janice!" The guy's tone sharpened. "Just do what I say! I'll handle this for</span><span> you. Now go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janice burst into tears. "How are you going to fix this? Don't think I don't know what you're doing. You're just sending me away to satisfy his sick demands!</span><br><span>"I won't let you do this! So what if he blacklists me? I can quit acting if I </span><span>have to!"</span></p></div>
