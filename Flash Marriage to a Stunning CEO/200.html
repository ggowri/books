        <h1>Chapter 200 Delusions of Grandeur</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the crowded expo hall, Vivienne stared coldly at Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but recall what Rebecca had told her the last time they met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca said the killer wasn't Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne didn't believe Rebecca would say that without reason. She wasn't sure if she had overanalyzed it or had acted impulsively, but she'd shared her suspicion with Alistair, speaking from a place of friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea whether Alistair had taken her words to heart or just brushed them off as a joke, but she'd said what she needed to say, and that was enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she couldn't even be bothered to keep up a polite front. "Choose your words carefully. Being an adult means owning what you say and do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard snapped back, "Everyone thinks it's him. What makes you so sure it isn't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne countered, "If public opinion were enough to convict someone, why would we need a legal system at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not getting the last word, Richard turned on his heel and left in frustration.</span><br><span>Stupid woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly thought the Morgan family had fallen far enough for her to throw shade without consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You're picking the wrong side! You'll regret it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he returned to where Theresa had been chatting, he found a very different scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Henry, who had seemed quite taken with Theresa just moments ago, was now deep in conversation with a young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, the young woman was doing most of the talking, and Henry was listening with full attention, nodding along and clearly engaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa had been pushed to the sidelines. She tried to chime in several times but couldn't get a word in edgewise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman stood with her back to them&mdash;tall, poised, and graceful, her ponytail sleek and perfectly in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard instinctively quieted his steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't explain it, but for the first time in his life, he felt drawn to a woman just by her silhouette without even seeing her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa, clearly flustered by the sudden shift in dynamics, waved at him as soon as she saw him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over, and the moment he saw the young woman's face, he froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been with more women than he could count, but none of them had prepared him for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was beautiful beyond words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And not in a cheap or superficial way. Hers was not a beauty that stopped at the surface. She was like a book with a striking cover, emanating depth and quiet mystery long before a single page was ever opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard swallowed hard, a simpering smile creeping onto his face without him even realizing it. Just as he was about to speak, the woman glanced at him with the faintest flicker of distaste and then immediately looked away. Her expression was subtle but unmistakably clear, like she'd just seen something filthy, and even looking again might taint her pristine, elegant world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Richard began to question his appearance.</span><br><span>Did something go wrong with my hair? My suit? My cologne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd made a point of dressing well that day. Even Theresa had said he looked handsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, things had been going fine. He'd accompanied Theresa and still had enough bandwidth to flirt with the women who flirted back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So when did it all start to go wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Was it Alistair?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That one was expected. They had never gotten along, so it came as no surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came Vivienne. She was friends with Rebecca, so maybe she held a grudge, which was totally understandable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even know her. Why did she look at him like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contempt in her eyes shook him more than he cared to admit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman made a small gesture to Henry, and the two of them walked off to the side to continue their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa tried to follow, but the young woman shot her a sharp look. "Can't you tell we're trying to get away from you? Don't interrupt business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa let out an awkward laugh. "Ms. Ashbourne, please, go ahead. We'll just stay nearby. Won't bother you at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard was stunned to see his mother act so deferential, so eager to please this woman. So he failed to immediately register the name Ashbourne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's patience ran out. "Get lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa blinked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard blinked too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't even being aggressive, but something about her tone sent a chill down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard still wasn't entirely sure who she was. He'd heard of Caroline, sure, but he'd never met her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This woman's got some nerve. Who the hell is she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline ignored their reactions and casually said a few more words to Henry before walking away with a calm, unhurried grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard watched her as she left, his eyes locked on her figure. A well-dressed man approached her, said something with a smile, and then reached for her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The icy, impatient woman they'd just encountered now looked soft and sweet, practically nestling into his side. She tilted her head, smiling up at him, her entire demeanor transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard stood frozen, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even notice when his mother returned after failing to follow Henry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa said bitterly, "Stop staring. That's Gordon's daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard turned to her in disbelief. "That was Caroline Ashbourne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa's expression grew complicated. "Yes, that's her. Now you understand why I never thought Rebecca was good enough? There's always someone better out there. You're an exceptional man. You deserve more. But a woman like Caroline? She's not someone you can handle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard snapped, "Don't underestimate me, Mom. If Alistair can win her over, why can't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa paused, considering. "You know what, you've got a point. Rebecca's ex-husband won't be around much longer... so maybe you do have a shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled cryptically and then lowered her voice, "A thousand Rebeccas couldn't match one Caroline. You know how powerful she is, right? She's not just some rich girl, Son. She inherited Gordon's business savvy and built her own empire. The kind of money she has could last ten lifetimes. And on top of that, she's Gordon's only child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The implication was clear. Caroline would inherit everything Gordon had. The thought alone was enough to make her tremble with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she spoke, the brighter her eyes became. She'd always known her limits. Girls like Rebecca, she felt she could manage. But someone like Caroline? It was on a level so far above that she hadn't even dared to wish for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Richard's frustration had planted a seed. He was right. If even a guy like Alistair had made it into Caroline's life, then why not him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And besides, Alistair was about to go down in flames anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa looked at her son with new resolve. "I believe in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard's fighting spirit was suddenly blazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa quickly pivoted. "But don't rush it. We need to play the long game. First, let's secure that contract. Once it's signed, we'll be back in the game. Oh, and keep an eye on Rebecca. The investment funds? Make sure they come from her."</span></p></div>
