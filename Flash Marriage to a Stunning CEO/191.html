        <h1>Chapter 191 A Weird Man</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stepped into a sunlit hat store with Eloise by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The summer heat was kicking in, and it was time to find her a couple of good sun hats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he browsed, Eloise got distracted by a Persian cat strutting past the shop window. She stood at the glass, tapping gently and cooing, "Kitty, kitty..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was always well-behaved. Even with the door right there, she never wandered off. Ever since that one terrifying incident where a careless nanny had nearly lost her, Eloise had learned to stay close. If she couldn't hold a grown-up's hand, she'd stay within arm's reach, never out of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she came running over and threw her arms around Alistair's leg, burying her face in his pants like she'd seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alarmed, Alistair crouched and scooped her into his arms. "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her face tucked into his chest, her voice came out small but steady. "There was a weird man. He was staring at me for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's expression shifted in an instant. His eyes sharpened like glass as he turned toward the window. "Where?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise peeked out cautiously and pointed. "He was standing right under that tree... but now he's gone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair tightened his hold on her. "It's okay. Daddy's here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say things like "Are you sure you saw him?" or "Maybe you imagined it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people said kids didn't lie, but they did make things up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair knew Eloise didn't. She didn't lie, and she didn't make things up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took every word she said seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discreetly contacted his security team and asked if they'd seen any suspicious strangers nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their answer was unexpected. No suspicious strangers. But... there was a suspiciously familiar face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair raised an eyebrow, thoughtful. Then he calmly selected a hat, paid for it, and stepped out of the shop with Eloise still in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were only a five-minute walk from their neighborhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy," Eloise whispered against his collar, "he's there. That weird man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tucked her face back into his shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, someone stood across the street. The man wore a full black tracksuit, a black bucket hat, and dark sunglasses. His outfit was stylish, even cool on the surface, but the way he leaned against the tree, hollow and motionless, cast a kind of darkness around him. To a child's eyes, he must've looked like a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair kept walking, unhurried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise leaned in close and whispered, "Don't look him in the eyes, Daddy. I think he has pink eye. That kind of sickness can spread!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair chuckled softly, "Don't worry, sweetheart. Daddy's tough. I won't catch anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was light, but the closer they got, the more uneasy he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just for a moment, and then, as always, he pulled himself back into composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man in the bucket hat lifted his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's eyes narrowed slightly. Eloise was right. The man's eyes were red. But it wasn't from infection. It was from crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seriously?</span><br><span>Alistair sighed. He'd intended to walk right past him. But when he saw him like this, it stirred something in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bring himself to turn away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo stood up. His eyes were bloodshot, but he didn't bother to hide it. His voice was hoarse. "You knew, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was abrupt. But Alistair knew exactly what he meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's jaw clenched. "Then why didn't you just tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair looked him in the eye. "If I had told you... would you have believed me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His silence answered everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise peeked out of Alistair's arms, studying Leo curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd met him before, but not often. Caroline had always kept a respectful distance between Eloise and the Reeds. Maybe five times, tops. And Eloise had been much younger, so she didn't remember.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo caught her gaze. Eloise quickly ducked back into Alistair's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without making a scene, Alistair subtly shifted his hold to shield her from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was calm, polite, and distant. "We're heading home now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo didn't respond. He just looked down at the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair turned and walked on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy," Eloise whispered urgently, "the weird guy's following us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sighed and stopped. He then turned around. "Is there something else you need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo rubbed his face with both hands and then said dryly, "I'm a wreck. The least you could do is buy me a cup of coffee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stared at him, searching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is it just coffee? Or does he know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered something Caroline had said once... about how Eloise was starting to resemble her mother more and more. He also remembered what Eloise said earlier that someone had been staring at her. Now, Alistair had a sinking feeling. Leo might've figured it out. He might know who Eloise really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't flinch. "Well," he said, "that's not my call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo squinted. Then, after a moment, he pulled out his phone and dialed Julian, because even now, he still didn't have Caroline's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short call, he hung up, visibly relieved. "She said yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wasn't surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't hide Eloise forever just to keep Leo in the dark. And they certainly weren't going to kill him to shut him up. Some things had to be faced, however uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That said, one thing was non-negotiable. Eloise wasn't going anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair remembered a conversation he'd once had with Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had talked about blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How strange and powerful it could be. How some children were raised by their grandparents and still, somehow, bonded deeply with parents they barely knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if Eloise felt that? What if she wanted to go back to her biological father?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered Caroline's answer clearly. "I'll support whatever she chooses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had told him that adopting Eloise had reminded her of her own childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least she'd had Mabel's love. Eloise had no one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't taken her home that day, she knew she would've regretted it for the rest of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she wasn't someone who lived with regrets. So she didn't hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back, she was deeply grateful she'd made the right choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't adopted Eloise out of some need for gratitude. She hadn't wanted anything in return. All she'd ever wanted was for Eloise to grow up happy and healthy. Nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if one day, Eloise chose to be with Leo instead, Caroline wouldn't stand in her way. She would let her go.</span></p></div>
