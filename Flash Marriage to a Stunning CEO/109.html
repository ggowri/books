        <h1>Chapter 109 Rejected by the Kindergarten</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sorry, but your son doesn't meet our admission criteria." The kindergarten staff member apologetically pushed the documents back across the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca, who had been calmly waiting for the enrollment process to complete in the spacious, well-lit office, was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After angrily withdrawing Daniel from Angel's Garden, Rebecca had spent several consecutive days determinedly dragging Daniel out of bed early to wait at the kindergarten entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, by the time the horrific blue and purple bruises on her face had completely healed, she still hadn't caught a glimpse of Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca raged, clenching her teeth.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">That conniving woman must have guessed I'd confront Alistair at Angel's Garden. </span><span>She's afraid of exposing her true colors, so she sent someone else to pick up the little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca decisively changed her strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after patiently waiting like a hunter at a rabbit's burrow for several more days, she still hadn't spotted the little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did it suddenly dawn on her that the little girl might have switched kindergartens altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's heart raced with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a city as vast as New York, who knew where the little girl had disappeared to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't care which school the girl had transferred to&mdash;she only feared she might never get another chance to see Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If things continued this way, the rift between her and Alistair would never heal, and she would lose him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mere possibility caused a twisting sensation in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She immediately abandoned her pointless waiting game and began searching for a new kindergarten for Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ordinary kindergartens were naturally beneath her standards and unworthy of Daniel's status. If he was going to attend anywhere, it would have to be an elite kindergarten on par with Angel's Garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So the prestigious kindergarten formerly known as Hello Baby Academy, now renamed Eloise Academy, became the perfect choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca arrived at Eloise Academy with Daniel and all the required enrollment paperwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The staff member greeted them with a smile but subtly turned them away. "I'm sorry, ma'am, but perhaps you should try looking at other kindergartens."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca immediately sensed the discrimination. Her anger flared instantly, akin to a cat stepping on its tail. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She placed the stack of documents on the desk and said firmly, "Please explain the reasons for the rejection. Are you afraid that I can't afford the tuition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca felt discriminated against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was the staff member aware that her shirt alone cost 9,900 dollars and her watch was valued at 388 thousand dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the perfume she'd sprayed on that morning had a five-digit price tag. Did she look like someone who couldn't afford school tuition?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The staff maintained a polite, professional smile. "I'm sorry, ma'am, please calm down&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca fiercely interrupted her, "I'm not going to waste my time talking to some clueless hick like you. Get your director. I want to speak with the director directly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meeting the director, Ivy Finch, Rebecca found her response identical to what the kindergarten staff had told her.</span><br><span>"I'm sorry, Ms. Whitfield, but your son doesn't meet our acceptance criteria," Ivy explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's face darkened with anger. "Which criteria doesn't he meet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ivy spoke in riddles while smiling gently and kindly, "Ms. Whitfield, I believe you already know the reason."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca wasn't naive. Following Ivy's hint, she immediately understood that she must have offended someone who had blacklisted her at this kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She let out a cold laugh. "Who's trying to make things difficult for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ivy smiled apologetically, "I'm sorry, but we're simply following our boss' instructions. As for the rest, I think you probably understand the situation better than we do, Ms. Whitfield."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca gritted her teeth. Her luck had been terrible lately, and there was no shortage of people she'd fallen out with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She considered carefully.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">First, there's Alistair... no, forget about him. Just thinking about him makes my chest feel tight, like I can't breathe. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then Vivienne... no, definitely not Vivienne. She's not the type to be so petty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She leaned back in her chair, her brow furrowed deeply.</span><br><span>Richard... the Morgan family? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regardless, Daniel was still Morgan's blood. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if the Morgan family resented me for sending Richard to jail, they wouldn't go so far as to destroy us completely. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they pushed her family too far and they ended up in a public feud, they'd lose face too. They probably wouldn't go so far as to completely destroy them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She figured it out.</span><br><span>So it must be... that damn woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca nearly cracked her back teeth from clenching them so hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the work of some woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ivy smiled apologetically, "I'm sorry, Ms. Whitfield, but we're just employees here. Please don't make the situation difficult for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca tossed back a retort. "You should consider it an honor that I'm willing to send my son to Eloise Academy. Your refusal to accept my son will be your greatest loss. I hope you won't regret this decision!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She then took Daniel by the hand and strode out with the regal bearing of a queen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel looked back at the whimsical, child-friendly buildings of Eloise Academy and tugged at Rebecca's hand, reluctant to leave. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, I want to go to this kindergarten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca replied with exasperation, "We're not going to this one, honey. This kindergarten isn't any good. Mom will find you somewhere much better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the third floor in Ivy's office, Ivy stood by the window watching the mother and son tussling below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She spoke into the microphone, "Boss, you predicted it correctly. That little boy named Daniel came today. We sent them away as you instructed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good," a cool voice came through the speaker. "You did well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca humiliatingly shoved Daniel into the car and pulled out her phone to make a call. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You still haven't found that woman's whereabouts? Useless excuses! I've spent all this money and patiently waited three days, and now you're telling me you've got nothing? Are you kidding me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca felt like the whole world was against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wouldn't let that damned woman get away with it. The ridiculous part was that she didn't even know who the woman was, let alone how to get her revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hired a private investigator who had confidently promised results, but now he was hesitating, telling her he had found absolutely nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was beside herself with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She absentmindedly scrolled through Instagram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if her romantic life and everything else weren't miserable already, now she had to watch others flaunt their perfect relationships online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca decisively closed the app and moved to block the person's posts. But after exiting, something compelled her to click back almost immediately.</span><br><span>She frowned at the couple's photo&mdash;faces pressed together in an obnoxious display of affection&mdash;then her eyes fell on the caption below: [Another morning awakened by Mr. Harlow's love.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps because of Alistair, she was particularly sensitive to the surname "Harlow."</span></p></div>
