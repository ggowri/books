        <h1>Chapter 91 Waiting</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given that Caroline was still on the mend from her illness, he naturally assumed she was running a fever again and didn't take it as a romantic overture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the pitch-blackness, Alistair quickly reached out to touch Caroline's forehead, then his own to make a comparison. Their temperatures seemed pretty much the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was struck dumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Looks like I've really made a mess of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alistair was about to get up and grab the thermometer, she reached out and grabbed his arm, her voice weak as she pleaded, "I'm just cold, that's all. I don't feel anything else is wrong. Please don't go. Stay with me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blatant dependence in her voice stirred up Alistair's protective instincts right away. He lay back down, pulling Caroline into his embrace. Gently patting her back, he cooed in a soothing tone, like he was trying to lull a child to sleep, "I'm right here. Go to sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had always been a terrible sleeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was a light sleeper, waking up at the slightest sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd tried every trick in the book to get a good night's rest, but nothing seemed to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it seemed she'd finally found the perfect solution&mdash;Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once in his arms, Caroline felt like a little fawn that had found a safe haven. A wave of security washed over her. She closed her eyes, and before she knew it, sleep had claimed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half-asleep, she felt like there was something she'd forgotten. After a moment of thought, Caroline finally remembered. "Night, honey," she mumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair smiled tenderly, "Night... honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't quite as used to calling her "honey" as she was to calling him "honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He figured he'd have to practice saying it more often to get the hang of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time slipped by, and at last, the sky began to lighten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As dawn gradually brightened the world, the outside came back to its usual hustle and bustle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thick curtains did an excellent job of blocking the light, so the room remained dim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the bed, the couple still slumbered soundly, cuddling each other, just as they had when they first drifted off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the alarm clock hadn't gone off, they likely would have slept until late morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had been ages since they'd had such a good night's sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was roused by Alistair's alarm. She opened her eyes and found herself looking into Alistair's sleepy eyes. "Morning, honey," she greeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was completely smitten.</span><br><span>Waking up to a beautiful woman smiling sweetly at me and calling me honey... Is this a dream?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He closed his eyes as if he wanted to stay in this wonderful dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was a bit confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he still half-asleep?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she wriggled out of Alistair's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've been lying on his arm all night. I bet it's numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Alistair's arm wasn't numb at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thanks to those Body Fortification Pills, he was in top-notch condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the day before, he'd accidentally drunk Caroline's water, yet he felt perfectly fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline dashed into the dressing room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They'd spent the night in each other's arms, well, one and a half nights if she included the previous one. She just wasn't ready to change clothes in front of Alistair yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, their level of intimacy still needed a bit of a push.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she was set on making it happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel watched them strolling hand in hand, a big smile on her face. "Breakfast's on the table. Come and dig in," she called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Such a loving young couple. It really puts my mind at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the meal, Caroline decided to put off going to the office and joined Alistair to take Eloise to their family's kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the way, she told Alistair about the plan to move. Alistair simply replied, "It's your call, honey. I'm right behind you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise tilted her little head up, her eyes flitting between her dad and mom. Her short legs were swinging merrily as she beamed from ear to ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once I start at the new kindergarten, Dad won't go to the old one anymore. Then I won't have to worry about that mean kid trying to steal Dad from me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Near the intersection by Angel's Garden, Daniel was dragging his feet, holding Rebecca's hand, and looking around impatiently. "Mom, how come Dad isn't here yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yesterday, Rebecca had stormed in and declared Daniel's withdrawal from the kindergarten right in front of Gina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But today, here she was, back again with Daniel. She wasn't sending Daniel back to school, though. Once the words were out, there was no taking them back. If she did send him back, it'd be like slapping herself in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Speaking of slaps, Rebecca's face turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That bitch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She did it on purpose, hitting me only on one side of the face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That half of my face was swollen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, after such an insult, Rebecca would have run back to her parents, crying and throwing a fit, demanding they get justice for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, she knew her mess with Richard had already disappointed her parents. Going back would only add to their troubles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So she'd gone back to her own little home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite her meticulous self-care, the swelling had only just begun to subside. However, half of her face still bore the telltale signs of bruising, a mottled mess of purples and blues. In recent days, Rebecca had felt so self-conscious that she'd hardly dared to step out in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the moment, she was fully concealing her face behind a black mask and a pair of sunglasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel had been so terrified the previous day that he'd jolted awake, screaming, several times throughout the night. Rebecca had stayed up with him, utterly worn out. Yet, when the time came, she'd still hauled the listless Daniel out of bed and brought him here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was eager to see Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She fancied herself quite familiar with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair seems to have a penchant for gentle and kind-hearted women. Well, unfortunately, that isn't me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But I can put on a gentle act if only Alistair would return to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca took a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once Alistair lays eyes on the bruises on my face and realizes how vicious that woman is, will he still be smitten with her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even if I can't get him to leave her right away, I can at least sow a seed of doubt in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once there's a crack in their relationship, I still stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But despite her bravado, just the thought of facing Alistair made her palms go sweaty. "Maybe that little girl is sick and took the day off?" she told Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel scowled and grumbled, "I wish she'd kick the bucket. Then Dad would come back and be my dad again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They always said kids could blurt out the most unexpected things, and it was up to parents to set them straight when they said something out of line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when Rebecca heard Daniel's words, she didn't scold him for being inappropriate. Instead, a thought crept into her mind.</span><br><span>If that damned woman died, Alistair might actually come back to me...</span></p></div>
