        <h1>Chapter 198 Richard and His Mom</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expo was packed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This international tech fair, co-hosted by the New York municipal government and top corporations from around the world, had drawn massive attention thanks to the presence of high-end tech giants. Attendees included elite executives and senior engineers, people most only ever saw in financial news or online headlines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to these industry veterans, Caroline was undeniably young. But that didn't mean she lacked credibility. Still, she'd rarely appeared in public before this, and very few people even knew she was the president of Vireon Technologies. In a sea of powerful figures, her presence should've blended in like a drop of water disappearing into the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she stood out anyway as her looks were too striking. No matter where she went, she turned heads. And with Alistair by her side, elegant and impossibly handsome, they made a stunning pair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't even made it far into the venue when people nearby began to notice them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard was also making the rounds at the expo, accompanied by his mother, Theresa Morgan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Theresa's relentless damage control, the recent wave of negative press surrounding Richard had mostly died down. Knowing how high the stakes were, Richard had taken the time to groom himself meticulously before stepping out. As expected, he brought a fair amount of prestige to Theresa just by showing up looking the way he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for his dashing appearance to attract the attention of many women in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This expo wasn't just a showcase for innovative products. It was also a rare opportunity for the Morgan family to network, strike new deals, and claw their way out of a business crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa looked radiant, every movement exuding the poised elegance of a high-society matron. Just by appearances, no one would've guessed she'd once been the infamous mistress who drove a wife to her death to climb into power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was deep in conversation with the head of a foreign tech company, Henry Bourne, a charming executive who smiled and nodded in clear agreement with everything she was saying. If nothing went wrong, they'd be signing a contract by the end of the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa casually brushed a hand through her glamorous curls and shot Richard a look, one that all but said it was already in the bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard beamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His admiration for Theresa ran deep and unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no problem in this world his mother couldn't solve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgan Group was on the verge of revival. They'd be back on top soon, stronger than ever.</span><br><span>Feeling the tension melt from his shoulders, Richard relaxed and began scanning the room. He even had the presence of mind to flash a flirtatious smile at a woman who'd been sneaking glances at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when he overheard a curious voice nearby. "Who's that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know the one in the back. That's Julian Hart from Vireon Technologies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the guy next to him? He's insanely good-looking. Wait, isn't that Alistair? Caroline's husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard's eyes widened. He instantly turned in the direction of the voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Vireon Technologies' booth, a sizable crowd had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stood beside the booth, pride flickering across his face as he watched the guests admiring their product.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After successfully launching robots designed for hazardous labor, machines meant to replace humans in dangerous jobs, Vireon Technologies had secured major contracts and moved into full-scale production. But that was just one of their initiatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With America entering an aging-society phase, the issue of elderly care had become increasingly urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vireon Technologies was now developing a new type of robot, one that could handle household chores like cooking, cleaning, making coffee, and taking blood pressure. But more importantly, these robots were designed to serve as companions for the elderly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They offered not just help with daily tasks but also round-the-clock health monitoring. If something happened to the elderly person&mdash;an accident, a medical emergency&mdash;while they were home alone, the robot would immediately call 911 or emergency services to get help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd just finished developing their prototype, model number FM-000. "FM" stood for "Family Member." In the vision of Vireon Technologies, this robot wasn't just a tool. It was meant to be part of the household, a presence that cared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Booth staff demonstrated its features to curious onlookers, while Julian provided explanations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair and Caroline stood quietly outside the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair glanced at Caroline's serene profile and, for a moment, she seemed to glow. Not with vanity, but with purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were two types of entrepreneurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first were pure capitalists, driven solely by profit. They didn't mind bending rules, dancing on the edge of legality, or compromising morals for financial gain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second type understood the value of business but also believed in giving back, contributing to social harmony in their own quiet way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, while other companies had funneled their resources into flashy, high-end service bots with the promise of high returns, Vireon Technologies, on the other hand, focused on solutions that directly impacted people's lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair frowned slightly and leaned close to Caroline. "I just saw someone I know," he said softly. "I'll be right back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline gave a small nod. "Don't go too far."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if it isn't you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard, riding high on optimism, stepped in front of Alistair and gave him a once-over, subtle but unmistakably judgmental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like the Whitfield couple's murder case didn't affect you one bit. Good for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sarcasm was clear in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors had swirled nonstop about Alistair's involvement in the Whitfield deaths. The media painted him as the Ashbourne family's pawn, using him to tighten their grip on power. Ashbourne Group's stock had taken a major hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Richard's mind, there was no way Gordon wouldn't blame Alistair for everything. After all, that leaked video was pretty damning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon had been visibly cold toward Alistair ever since, and everyone had seen it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Caroline might've been blindly in love, but if her father disapproved, there was no way this relationship would last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard had been waiting for Alistair to fall from grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that day, he was sure, was coming soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morgan family might not match Paige's ruthlessness, but they had their own ways of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police were already in the final stages of the investigation into the Whitfield case. Until the case was officially closed, no details would be made public. So the Morgans had no idea Alistair had already been arrested and released.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Paige wasn't about to risk exposure by telling them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard had full faith in Theresa's judgment. She said Alistair would be the scapegoat for the Whitfield murders, and he believed it. Gordon's cold shoulder only confirmed it further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But while Richard tried to stir the pot, Alistair didn't even look at him. His gaze slid past Richard's shoulder, focusing on something or someone behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far off, Theresa was still chatting enthusiastically with Henry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard clenched his jaw in frustration. Being ignored made his blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who the hell did he think he was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just some lucky punk who latched onto a rich woman and got a leg up, acting like Richard was somehow beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to say something more when someone walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard turned and did a double take. "Mr. Reed? I didn't expect to see you here. I really liked the lead single on your new album."</span></p></div>
