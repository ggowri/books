        <h1>Chapter 97 Spill the Beans</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The beefy bodyguard behind her was left rather dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Look, Liam might be a bit long in the tooth, but he's still got a decent look about him. Alistair takes after his mom, so there's not much resemblance there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And that ponytailed guy, well, he doesn't seem like the up-and-up type, but he's not hard on the eyes either. He's got that kind of bad-boy allure that today's young girls go gaga over...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But if Ms. Ashbourne says they're a couple of ugly losers, then they sure as hell are!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Still, don't we need to head down and give Mr. Harlow a hand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ms. Ashbourne's just standing here, watching the show like it's a picnic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be fair, it was clear as day to anyone with half a brain that Alistair was holding his own down there. For the time being, he didn't need any backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if things took a turn for the worse, they'd sprint down there in a flash to protect Alistair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What neither they nor Alistair knew was that Caroline had already sent some reliable folks to keep a low profile and guard him. They were lurking in the shadows, ready to jump into action and keep him safe at all costs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam turned around nervously, forcing a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. His voice had a hint of desperation as he pleaded, "Alistair..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stood his ground, not even flinching. "Some people just love to spread rumors about me. It's really starting to get on my nerves. To clear up any more messes like what happened today, how about you explain our little feud to Mr. Landry here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam's face went rigid, and the corner of his mouth twitched nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair sneered, his cold eyes fixed intently on Liam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam silently cursed Celeste a dozen times in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd had some leeway before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least he could have left with a shred of dignity after meeting Alistair's demands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that foolish woman, Celeste, had dragged Aaron into this mess, and now he was truly stuck between a rock and a hard place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron might be a notorious street tough with a questionable moral code, but he had his own set of values.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he found out that Liam had sold his own son for a measly two million dollars, he'd surely hold Liam in contempt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam's face flushed red with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Looks like I've got no other choice, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">To hell with it. I should figure out how to get rid of Aaron first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shame washed over him. He still had a bit of pride left, and it was mortifying to confess his past misdeeds in front of the younger generation. "Sorry, Aaron. You're probably having a field-day at my expense today. This whole thing is on me. Alistair was a great student back then, but I fell for my wife's lies. I thought he was no good at school, so I took two million dollars from someone. I lied to him, said I was in a bind and had to pay someone off, and made him drop out of school..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stuffed his hands in his pockets. "Who did you make the deal with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam hesitated for a moment. "Your classmate, Rebecca Whitfield."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Aaron around, it was easy to get Liam to talk. He spilled the beans without holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spilled the beans about how Rebecca had approached him all those years ago. Once he was done, he couldn't resist trying to shift the blame. "Alistair, I was totally duped by her&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair cut him off, his expression cold as ice. "So, where'd that two million dollars go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam gritted his teeth in frustration. "Well, a million dollars was for a new house, and the other million dollars sent Caleb off to study abroad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron stared at Liam in utter disbelief. After he was sure Liam wasn't lying, he let out a scoff and said, "Mr. Liam Harlow, you've really outdone yourself. Talk about 'selfless.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Using the money you got by ruining your own son's future to support your stepson. You're either a complete idiot or just heartless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam's face turned beet-red with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron shot a glance at Alistair, and there was a faint glimmer of sympathy in his eyes. Then, as if recalling something, he turned to Liam with a somewhat serious look, not bothering to hide the conversation from Alistair. "Yesterday, Mrs. Celeste Harlow told me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam cut him off right away. "Don't pay any heed to her ramblings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron squinted at Liam, annoyance flickering across his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, I've been made into a tool for a stepmom to take on her stepson? How interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron's expression was inscrutable. "Mr. Liam Harlow, our Landry family owes you one. Today..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam forced out a laugh. "You're being way too polite. What favor? It was nothing. Anybody would've done the same."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he talked, he stole nervous glances at Alistair, terrified that Alistair might suddenly blurt out the truth. Seriously, if Aaron found out what really happened, he was a goner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stuffed his hands in his pockets and wore a laid-back smile. When their eyes met, his smile grew wider, and his deep eyes gave away nothing of what was going on in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truth be told, Liam didn't know this son of his at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd always thought of Alistair as a meek little puppy. But once riled up, this so-called "puppy" would sink his teeth in and not let go until he'd ripped off a hunk of flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair asked, "Is it too much for me to ask you to fork over five million dollars, with interest, for screwing up my future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not at all, not at all..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great. Since you've said so, transfer the five million dollars to my designated bank account within two days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure, sure&mdash;hold on a sec." In front of Aaron, Liam was as compliant as a lamb, nodding along with whatever Alistair said. But only after the words left his mouth did he realize something was amiss. His eyes popped wide open. "Didn't you say I had a week? Now there's only..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair cut him off icily. "The situation's changed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair feigned concern. "Having trouble? No worries. You can go for Plan B, or I even have a Plan C&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam gritted his teeth. "Two days it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair gave a slight nod. "Fine. I'll be waiting to hear from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had presented Liam with a total of three options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first option was straightforward&mdash;cough up five million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second involved turning himself in and ratting out Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Liam wasn't keen on either of these, Alistair, ever the considerate one, had a third option up his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the one Liam dreaded the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bankruptcy or jail time were bad enough, but Liam was even more petrified of coming face-to-face with a living nightmare, Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Reaching into his pocket, Alistair pulled out his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd recorded every word Liam had said. Sure, Rebecca might try to weasel out of it, but there was no fooling everyone.</span></p></div>
