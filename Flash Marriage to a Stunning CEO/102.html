        <h1>Chapter 102 Liam in Trouble</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celeste could easily manipulate Liam into selling out Alistair. After all, Alistair wasn't her flesh and blood, and she was all about squeezing every penny she could out of him, regardless of the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what if she found out that Liam had swindled five million dollars from her own son and handed it over to Alistair? The fallout would be catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair and Liam had long since severed any semblance of a father-son bond. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair could have easily orchestrated Liam's demise through Aaron's hands, but he felt that would be letting Liam and Celeste, along with the beneficiary Caleb, off too lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Imagine if he hadn't had dirt on Liam&mdash;would he have been able to walk away unscathed from Aaron's clutches?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Celeste had Aaron "administer justice," she hadn't intended to leave any room for Alistair's survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was the outsider, the extra piece in their picture&mdash;a perfect family of three&mdash;loving parents and a dutiful, filial son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could stomach Liam's neglect and cold shoulder, but he couldn't stand idly by knowing he was the stepping stone to their blissful existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had ruined his life, so it was only fair that he dismantle their happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had anticipated their lives would spiral into chaos and planned to give it a nudge at the right moment to achieve a "family in ruins." But he hadn't expected events to unfold so swiftly, a stroke of luck that saved him the effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The money had arrived a little past eight, and by ten, Liam was in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alistair got wind of the news, he was just lying in bed, pondering how to casually wrap his arms around Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Secrets have a way of surfacing, and Liam hadn't intended to keep this one for long. He'd managed to extract five million dollars from Caleb to rid himself of the Alistair problem, and that was all that mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam and Celeste were on the outs, and he'd been staying elsewhere, planning to lay low for the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then Celeste called, sobbing about a fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite everything, she was still his wife for many years, and Liam panicked, rushing home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he opened the door, he was met with a barrage of fiery, bloody scratches across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celeste was like a woman possessed, clawing and scratching at him relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You old fool! How could you even think of asking Caleb to get five million dollars from his girlfriend? Don't you realize this will make her look down on him, and he'll never be able to hold his head up in front of her again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her stepmother act was a show of cruelty. She wished she could crush Alistair's bones and suck out the marrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when it came to her own son, her maternal instincts were pure and unadulterated. She always considered his best interests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celeste shielded him from worry, only sharing good news, and naturally, she hadn't mentioned the turmoil Alistair had caused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam had exploited this, convincing Caleb with a story of Celeste's illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam, who had always been distant and indifferent to Alistair, was all heart and soul for Caleb, genuinely looking out for him, which had inadvertently fooled Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after transferring the money, Caleb couldn't shake off his unease.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What kind of surgery costs five million dollars? How serious is Mom's illness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb's suspicion deepened when he called Celeste and heard her robust voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like that, Liam's deceit was unraveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam had used Caleb, wishing ill on Celeste, and his guilt made him give in repeatedly, hoping she'd calm down after venting her anger and listen to his explanation, so they could move on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Celeste was relentless, seemingly intent on not stopping until she'd beaten him to death, and finally, Liam's patience snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam shoved Celeste aside, his finger jabbing at her face as he roared, "You dare accuse me of being a lousy father? Fine, I'll admit I'm not perfect. But ask yourself this&mdash;how much have I ever done for Alistair? </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it weren't for my dad, he'd have starved to death! And Caleb? Did I ever skimp on anything for him? Everything he's ever had was the best we could afford! They're both my sons, both owe me respect. So what's wrong with me asking him for five million dollars when I'm in trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celeste's eyes bulged, her voice dripping with venom. "That little bastard? Born with a curse. How could he ever compare to my son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam's hand flew, slapping her across the face. "So you lied to me about him being a failure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celeste doubled down, her tone defiant. "He is a failure. He'll never measure up to Caleb&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I went to Stuyvesant High School in New York and talked to his old teachers!" Liam cut her off, his voice trembling with rage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alistair's grades were better than Caleb's ever were. His teachers said he could've gotten into any top-tier university. But you? You ruined his chances. You're a poisonous woman, a stepmother who couldn't stand to see her stepson succeed. What the hell was I thinking, falling for a viper like you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That two million dollars we got for selling him&mdash;one million dollars went into this house. Isn't your name on the deed? The other million dollars was invested in Caleb. Celeste, even a cornered rabbit will bite back. If you push him too far, do you really think he'll only come after me and spare you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The once inseparable couple, the picture-perfect pair who held hands everywhere they went, now stood torn apart, their love shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celeste would never admit fault. In her eyes, it was all Alistair's doing.</span><br><span>Petty! He's dredging up something that happened six years ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he'd gone to college, who</span><span> </span><span>was to say he'd have amounted to anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Plenty of graduates end up delivering food for a living!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He</span><span> </span><span>was just a scammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Two million dollars? Even after six years in the bank, it wouldn't earn three million dollars in interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And to think Liam went behind my back and gave that little bastard five million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her heart ached with bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That brat was only worth two million dollars. Why give him an extra three million dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam's slap sent her over the edge. She grabbed a vase and swung it wildly, striking him square on the back of the head. He crumpled to the floor, convulsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he lay in the hospital, still unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alistair heard the news, he muttered, "He deserved it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no joy in his heart, no sense of triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Alistair was pulled into a warm embrace, a gentle hand patting his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, don't overthink it. Sleep now. No matter what happens, I'm here for you. Eloise and I&mdash;we're your family."</span></p></div>
