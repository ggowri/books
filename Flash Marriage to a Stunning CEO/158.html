        <h1>Chapter 158 Silent Suffering</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne had been looking forward to tonight's party for weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew Giselle would be taking over Stellar Films soon. With the birthday party happening right here in New York, Anne saw it as the perfect opportunity to get into Giselle's good graces&mdash;a connection that could transform her acting career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After arriving, she'd searched the venue until she finally spotted Giselle in the garden by the pool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Anne was about to approach and strike up a conversation, she noticed someone else already there&mdash;a woman standing across from the elegantly dressed Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's heart skipped. It was Caroline, Alistair's wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two were deep in conversation. Giselle wore a smirk, while Caroline remained perfectly composed. After Giselle finished speaking, Caroline said something that wiped the smile clean off Giselle's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle walked toward the venue with Caroline trailing leisurely behind. When Giselle cut across the pool area, Anne witnessed something that made her gasp. Caroline pushed Giselle straight into the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What stunned Anne even more was how Caroline simply walked away afterward, radiating such arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anne felt both shocked that Alistair's wife would dare openly antagonize Giselle and profoundly grateful that she'd fled when she'd encountered Caroline at Vivienne's pizza restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Caroline was bold enough to take on Giselle, Anne didn't even want to imagine what she might have done to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, as the ruined party wound down, Anne saw her chance. She could ingratiate herself with the Reeves family and get back at Alistair for his past mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, no matter how formidable Alistair's wife might be, Anne didn't think she could stand against the Reeves family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Anne's eyes, Caroline was clearly just reckless. Giselle had only suffered because she'd been too gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that once Giselle's parents got involved, Caroline would pay dearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne seized her moment and rushed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's parents' expressions hardened immediately. "Who did it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne stood quietly, waiting for them to figure out the truth and thank her for coming forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, she'd not only befriend Giselle but also earn her parents' favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne could already picture it&mdash;Giselle becoming her best friend, lavishing resources on her career, arranging meetings with A-list directors and co-stars. She'd become an overnight sensation, fielding offer after offer...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's lying," Giselle said flatly. "Nobody pushed me. I slipped."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's jaw dropped. "But I saw&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You saw wrong." Giselle cut her off with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's impossible&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who even are you?" Giselle snapped. "The party's over. Why are you still here? Did you stick around just to gawk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne stood frozen as her dreams crumbled. Before she could process what was happening, security guards were driving her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle maintained her story&mdash;she'd simply slipped. Her parents accepted it without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why wouldn't they? Their daughter was no pushover. If someone had actually attacked her, she'd never let it slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It never occurred to them that this time, Giselle had no choice but to suffer in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment her parents left, Giselle's mask fell away, revealing pure venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Caroline had been enemies for years. She still remembered the beating Caroline had given her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Giselle learned Caroline had married some nobody, she'd been ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much for the business genius&mdash;turns out she was just another fool for love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Giselle sent the invitation, she hadn't expected Caroline to actually show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since she had, Giselle couldn't waste the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the pretense of concern, she'd taken every chance to mock Caroline's husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been walking away, savoring her victory, when Caroline spoke behind her. Before Giselle could react, she was in the pool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle burned with rage, but she had to bite her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had made one thing clear&mdash;if Giselle breathed a word about this, Caroline would tell Leo the truth. About how Giselle had spread lies back in junior high, telling teachers that Leo was dating his female deskmate, ultimately forcing the girl to transfer schools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle and Leo had grown up together. She'd been in love with him since childhood, but no matter how obvious she made it, Leo remained uninterested in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, however, adored Giselle and wanted her to marry Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd always favored Giselle over Caroline. Years ago, when Giselle had brazenly searched through Caroline's room and Caroline had beaten her for it, Paige had immediately retaliated against Caroline. Their relationship had been strained ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo and his deskmate had been nothing more than friends, but Giselle's jealousy had destroyed an innocent girl's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo had been furious about the incident but never discovered who'd started the rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle knew that if Leo ever learned the truth, any chance between them would be dead forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seethed at Caroline. Even if she did manage to get Leo someday, Caroline would always have this weapon to hold over her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of being under Caroline's thumb for the rest of her life was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as frustration threatened to overwhelm her, Paige called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Paige got hurt, she'd been resting in an empty room before hurriedly leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd clearly heard about the pool incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had long considered Paige her future family. They were closer than Giselle was with her own mother, sharing secrets she'd never tell anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Giselle, you're a grown-up," Paige said gently. "Tell me what really happened today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's reputation affected not just Reeves Group but the Reed family as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, thanks to Paige's careful orchestration, Giselle and Leo were now inextricably linked in the public eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's tender concern cracked Giselle's composure. The tears came fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caroline came to my party..." she sobbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did she push you?" Paige's voice turned sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's sobs were answer enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't bear being the victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd always been the one in control, the one others feared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she knew only Paige could make Caroline pay.</span></p></div>
