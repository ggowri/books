        <h1>Chapter 94 Love-struck Fool</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After living with her for so many years, how could he not know her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how sweetly she talked in public, the fact remained that she couldn't stand Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd secretly pitted her own son, Caleb, against Alistair. Once, when she noticed that Alistair was a few inches taller, she went on a shopping spree, buying all sorts of so-called height-boosting supplements. "Caleb, you gotta take these every day. They'll make you as tall as a basketball player!" she'd insisted, shoving the pills at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another time, seeing Alistair's clear, smooth skin, she ordered Caleb, "You should wear a mask whenever you go out. It'll protect your skin." Caleb rolled his eyes, muttering, "Mom, that's so girly. I'm not doing it." If he hadn't put his foot down, she probably would've gone as far as getting him an umbrella to shield him from the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Liam's mind flashed back to Caleb's senior year in high school. Celeste had turned into an absolute maniac. "Caleb, you're not going to bed until you finish these practice tests. I want you to ace the SATs!" she'd scream. Night after night, she forced Caleb to study until one or two in the morning. Poor Caleb couldn't take it anymore. He ran away from home several times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam came to an abrupt halt, his face frozen in a mask of shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was dead certain of what he'd just realized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Celeste found out Alistair was outshining Caleb at school. She was terrified Alistair would blow Caleb out of the water on the SAT. So, so...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam's expression kept shifting, a whirlwind of shock, remorse, and anger swirling across his face like a wild carousel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Do not think Liam felt guilty just because he'd discovered he'd been duped by his second-wife, and it had cost his son a shot at college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he'd known Alistair was a top-notch student back then, he might've just hemmed and hawed a bit longer and made Rebecca's job a tad more difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was selfish to the core. Just like Celeste had put it, what good would it do him if Alistair went to college? Could it land him a cool two million dollars right away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a bit more of Celeste's sweet-talking in his ear, he'd still have sold his own flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, well, Liam saw things differently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd always been big on glorifying himself, convinced he was a stand-up father.</span><br><span>If Celeste hadn't lied to me, I'd never have just sat back and watched my own son drop out of school. That conniving bitch Celeste is the one who drove a wedge between me and my boy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Celeste's call came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Liam, what the hell? Are you coming home tonight or what? If you don't haul your ass back here pronto, we're getting divorced. I'll live with Caleb, and you can go live with that little bastard son of yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celeste's pushy words got Liam's blood boiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The previous night, when he'd rushed out of the house, he'd done his damnedest to persuade Celeste to come with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she was as stubborn as a mule and refused to budge an inch. Left with no other option, Liam had to leave on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fear had gnawed at him ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back in the day, in his desperate bid for a promotion and a raise, he'd pulled some shady stunt on a colleague. He never in a million years thought that the seemingly timid colleague had a son with underworld connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that guy ever found out what he'd done, Liam's life would be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, apart from resenting Alistair for being so heartless, Liam held the deepest grudge against Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thanks to the previous transition at the kindergarten, Eloise, whose personality had become increasingly outgoing, bid a sweet farewell to Alistair and Caroline without a single tear or tantrum. "See you this afternoon, Mom and Dad," she said obediently, then followed the new teacher away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, Caroline headed to the company while Alistair went home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The new house needed a thorough renovation, which would take quite some time. She had made the decision to transfer Eloise to a new kindergarten rather abruptly. The kindergarten had been purchased at a high price in the shortest possible time, but she had to put some effort into decorating the new house to make it as cozy as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the time being, they would continue to live in their current place and move to the new house once it was all set up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thankfully, their current residence wasn't too far from the new kindergarten. It was also located in the city center, only about a ten-minute drive farther than the old kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As usual, Caroline drove Alistair back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite having multiple cars in the family, including Alistair's chauffeur-driven car for Eloise's pick-up and drop-off, Caroline chose to use one car as she seized every chance to be with Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, it was to get to know him better as quickly as possible. Now that their feelings were in sync, Caroline wanted to be with Alistair all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching his handsome, upright back, Caroline was tempted to ditch work right away, jump out of the car, and chase after him to build their relationship at home.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Am I turning into one of those love-struck fools?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline decided to be a bit reckless.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">So what if I'm love-struck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Alistair's figure completely disappeared from sight, Caroline composed herself and calmly said, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stood in front of the huge floor-to-ceiling window in the living room, watching the Rolls-Royce carrying Caroline drive away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair returned to the bedroom, grabbed her cute white pillow, and hugged it as if she were in his arms. Grinning like a loon, he started rolling around on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's almost unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Such an amazing girl is mine now!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the day, when Rebecca's torment had him teetering on the brink of a breakdown, he'd often found himself railing against the unfairness and cruelty of fate. "What did I ever do to deserve this? I've never done a single bad thing in my life!" he'd shout.</span><br><span>But if all those hardships were to prepare me to meet Caroline and, of course, our little angel Eloise, then it's all worth it. Now, the tough times are finally over, and the good days have come!</span></p></div>
