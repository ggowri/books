        <h1>Chapter 14 Who Does He Think He Is?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair turned to face Rebecca as she stormed after him, fury written all over her face. When she raised her hand to slap him, he smoothly caught her wrist mid-air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't about to suffer another humiliating slap across the face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca's eyes widened in shock. "Alistair, are you challenging me? You actually dared to fight back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair pushed her hand away. "Rebecca, I'd rather not stoop to fighting with a woman like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His warning came in an even tone, his expression barely changing&mdash;yet it carried as much intimidation as if he'd shouted at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca stumbled backward, her mind reeling with shock. This wasn't her imagination. Alistair seemed like a stranger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Rebecca felt like she was meeting him for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca stood frozen for barely two seconds before quickly recovering. She glared at Alistair with a mocking smile. "Alistair, know your place! The more you act like this, the more I can't stand you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair looked at her, completely baffled. "Whether you like me or not, why would I care?" he replied coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, he hoped she wouldn't like him at all. Who would want the affection of a crazy woman? The very thought made his skin crawl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca kept her eyes fixed on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This unfamiliar version of Alistair made Rebecca's heart race with anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't realized that something important was slipping from her control, something she desperately wanted to hold onto, fearing that once released, it would be gone forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes fell on the beautifully wrapped gift box in his hands. "I really underestimated you," she sneered. "Looks like Vivienne has a soft spot for you. But let me warn you. Vivienne isn't exactly a step up. She's just playing with you because you're something new. Do you honestly think she likes you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even someone as dense as Alistair could now see that Rebecca had completely misunderstood his relationship with Vivienne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, he was bewildered. Vivienne was supposed to be her best friend, after all. She shouldn't describe Vivienne as such a casual girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then it hit him. This was Rebecca after all. The same Rebecca who, when he "misbehaved", would force him to stand barefoot on the freezing balcony in winter wearing only thin pajamas, making him face the wall all night with the windows wide open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when he caught a terrible cold the next day, barely able to stand without passing out, she still expected him to prepare three meals daily for her and Daniel, only to call him useless afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone like her didn't deserve friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair didn't care about being falsely accused himself, but he felt it was unfair to Vivienne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not what you think. There's nothing between Vivienne and me," he frowned, "and frankly, it's none of your business."<br>He didn't want an innocent Vivienne getting dragged into this mess and had no interest in arguing with Rebecca.<br>Instead, he threw out a question. "Does Richard know you're meeting with me behind his back? Don't forget, no matter what, I'm still the ex-husband who lived with you for six years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Rebecca could answer, Alistair walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was trying to remind Rebecca.<br>Aren't you so concerned about your crush's feelings? Then stop getting tangled up with your ex-husband and making him uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Rebecca heard something completely different.<br>He's obviously jealous of Rick. Heh! What right does he have to be jealous of Rick? He's deliberately getting involved with Vivienne just to get under my skin. How childish and ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Vivienne drove away from home, a Mercedes boldly blocked her path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Glancing at the license plate, Vivienne raised an eyebrow in surprise. She rolled down her window and smiled at the driver. "Rebecca, come on, don't be difficult. I need to get to my restaurant right away. I have so many things waiting for me. Another time, I promise we'll hang out properly, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unlike Rebecca and Anne, who only knew how to enjoy their privileged lives, Vivienne was busy running her own business&mdash;a pizza shop she'd started from scratch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca said nothing, just stared at her coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne finally noticed something was off, and her casual smile faded as her brows furrowed slightly. "What's wrong, Rebecca?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca's mouth twisted into a sneer, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she launched into what felt like an interrogation. "You tell me, Ms. Everett."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne looked thoughtful for a moment before something clicked. "How long have you been here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca's smile deepened. "About an hour?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne fell silent. Alistair had left exactly an hour ago. Rebecca must have seen them together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This realization didn't particularly worry Vivienne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Alistair had always been Rebecca's go-to guy, and they were divorced now anyway. There was nothing wrong with her and Alistair connecting privately. They were both single adults.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, she'd openly asked Rebecca for his number in the first place. She had nothing to hide!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca's expression darkened. "Vivienne, don't you have something you want to tell me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne couldn't help but laugh. "What exactly do you want me to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to contain herself any longer, Rebecca blurted out, "Did you turn me down because of Alistair?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne shook her head. "Of course not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca laughed harshly. "I saw it with my own eyes and you're still denying it? Vivienne, I thought you were my friend. What am I to you?<br>"I thought you were just joking around, but you actually took him home? What, did you introduce him to your parents? Were they impressed with my ex-husband?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne just stared at her silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca took the silence as guilt and continued her sarcastic laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rebecca," Vivienne finally said quietly, "yes, I invited Alistair to my home. How is that any of your business?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is it not my business?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rebecca, don't forget you and Alistair are divorced. Your marriage was fake to begin with, and now you have Richard."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne's reminder only made Rebecca more furious. "Anne was right about you! Has Alistair brainwashed you? You're throwing away years of friendship to side with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Rebecca, Vivienne was reminded of high school. Rebecca had been just as upset back then, when she and Richard were still in that flirty, not-quite-dating phase. Some girl who had a crush on Richard had asked him about homework and chatted with him for a few minutes. Rebecca had happened to see it...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Years later, here was Rebecca showing the same jealous rage again. Except this time, it was over Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne sighed helplessly, "You're overthinking this. It was my mom's birthday, so I asked him to come cook dinner... But Rebecca, you and Alistair have gone your separate ways. Who he sees and what he does is his business, isn't it? Are you sure you're not just jealous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca bristled when Vivienne implied she had no right to control Alistair. She was about to argue back as if she'd just heard the most ridiculous joke, when Vivienne cut her off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rebecca, you need to be honest with yourself," Vivienne said. "Are you still hung up on Richard, or have you started to care more about Alistair after spending so much time together?"</p></div>
