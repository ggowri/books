        <h1>Chapter 133 Protecting Them</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's plan was simple but perfect for dealing with someone like Celeste, who had basically lost her mind with hatred for </span><span>him. He intended to provoke her into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Caroline found out what he was planning, she strongly objected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get what you're trying to do, but putting yourself in danger is completely off the table," she said, pacing anxiously around the office</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if something goes wrong? What would Eloise and I do without you?" Her voice rose with unusual emotion. "You have responsibilities to me and Eloise&mdash;and to any future children we might have!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair locked the office door before pulling her into a </span><span>comforting embrace. "Don't worry, I'm not about to throw away our happiness. I'll be extremely careful, I promise. Nothing's going to happen to me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could make such bold promises with complete confidence, knowing he had the system backing him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, he'd made numerous pivotal life choices, and having a supportive wife by his side had saved him countless system credits. His balance had steadily grown to over three thousand credits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, Caroline and Eloise meant everything to Ali</span><span>stair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their health and safety were his top priority, which was why he didn't hesitate to spend 500 system credits on a "Safety Card" for Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The business world was full of deception and betrayal, and despite Caroline's prominent family </span><span>background, she could still become a target. The Safety Card gave her an extra layer of protection, ensuring her continued well-being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Caroline was his first treasure, Eloise was certainly his second, and Alistair wasn't about to play favorites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sys</span><span>tem Store only allowed each item to be purchased once per year, so with the Safety Card unavailable, he spent another 500 credits on a "Health Card" for Eloise instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already proving its worth. While preschool was typically a breeding ground for a</span><span>ll sorts of contagious illnesses, with many kids recently coming down with fevers and coughs, Eloise had remained perfectly healthy and energetic, completely unaffected by the germs around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had made sure to protect himself too. He was an essen</span><span>tial part of their happy family and couldn't risk any unexpected trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd purchased something called "The Schemer's Bane," designed to make anyone plotting against him face the consequences of their own actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is Celeste a horrible person? She absol</span><span style="font-style: italic;">utely, without a doubt, is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wasn't afraid of her. But Caroline had no idea about his system!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's still not happening," Caroline said firmly. Her voice, usually soft when speaking to Alistair, had hardened into something unyielding. "I </span><span>won't agree to anything that could put you in harm's way. You might as well give up on the idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was speechless, his emotions all over the place. But what he felt most wasn't disappointment&mdash;it was being touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's strong reaction showed </span><span>how much she cared about him, how worried she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, honey," he conceded. "Should we try to come up with another plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit, this is insane! Rich people really know how to party!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"New York's been non-stop drama these past couple of da</span><span>ys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And each scandal is crazier than the last!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of young people huddled together on the sidewalk, phones in hand, buzzing about today's juicy gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The story breaking the internet involved Brady, a manager and assistant director at Emerald Medi</span><span>a, caught in broad daylight participating in what could only be described as a group sex scandal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Law enforcement had deliberately withheld certain key details during interviews, but even the sanitized version of events that got out was enough to shock the</span><span> public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As internet users launched into another round of gleeful commentary, the officers who had made the arrests couldn't stomach their meals for days afterward, too disgusted by what they'd witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That scene was awful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At nine that night, a tall fi</span><span>gure in black appeared near a dessert shop at the base of Imperial Tower in New York's bustling commercial district.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed interested in the sweets, turning to buy something, and was just paying when a woman burst out from the flower bed next to the sh</span><span>op!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was holding a knife high above her head, the blade catching the bright lights with a terrifying gleam. She lunged straight for the man's heart, screaming like a maniac, "I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything happened so fast. The man in black had nowhere to d</span><span>odge. Sharp screams filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Murder! Someone's being murdered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People scattered in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron, watching from nearby, saw the knife about to plunge into the man's chest and couldn't stop himself from rushing forward. "Look out!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In th</span><span>e nick of time, the man in black moved with incredible grace, smoothly avoiding the woman's attack. When she stumbled forward and charged at him again like a wild animal, he stopped being polite and kicked her flying across the plaza.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron was still </span><span>shaking. "Are you okay?" His shirt was soaked with cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was the one who had told Celeste the time and place, along with that extra bit of information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incident completely intensified all of Celeste's hatred toward Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though</span><span> Aaron was just following Alistair's instructions and going through motions that should have been foolproof, what just happened had scared the hell out of him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the man in black glanced his way, Aaron froze for a moment before letting out a nervous lau</span><span>gh. It wasn't Alistair after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alistair sat in a car parked along the street, watching the situation unfold. Caroline was chattering away in his ear, which rarely happened. "Did you see that? Wasn't that terrifying? If that had been you, I'd </span><span>be a puddle on the floor right now, believe me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The stand-in I found for you is a battle-hardened special forces soldier. His reaction time and physical abilities are way beyond the average person's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, honey, I'm not trying to insult you, but we're n</span><span>ormal people. We're not even in the same league as someone with that kind of training. If you'd gone in yourself, could you have reacted that quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair nodded eagerly like a bobblehead. "Yes, you're absolutely right, honey. Thank you. You're amazi</span><span>ng."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in fact, he was thinking about different things.</span><br><span>My reactions would be even faster and better!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline wasn't usually this talkative, so she fell silent after her little rant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair teased her with a mischievous grin, "Hey, why'd you stop? Com</span><span>e on, scold me some more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was actually loving this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline just stared at him, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you manage to look so cute even when you're cursing me out? Keep going. I could listen all day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair leaned in closer, his smirk growing more ridi</span><span>culous by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline instinctively laughed and pulled back, not realizing she was falling right into his trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't want me anymore," Alistair whined, suddenly looking like a kicked puppy on the side of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline couldn't even </span><span>respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As smart as she was&mdash;and she knew perfectly well what game he was playing&mdash;seeing that dejected look on his face still made her heart clench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, whatever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and wrapped her arms around him from the side. He was her husband after all. Of co</span><span>urse she'd spoil him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when he was being manipulative, he was just too damn adorable.</span></p></div>
