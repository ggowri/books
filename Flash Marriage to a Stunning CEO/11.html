        <h1>Chapter 11 You Must Love Mommy Forever</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She'd always thought Alistair was dispensable, but now that he was gone, she realized his presence had touched every part of their lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The emotions she'd worked so hard to suppress bubbled up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She'd underestimated Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He must have been scheming for a long time, deliberately making her and Daniel dependent on him so they couldn't live without him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca silently fumed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair, I won't let your scheming succeed. There's no way you're coming back! Not only will I keep you away, but I'll also stop you from trying to worm your way into my best friend's life!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait, has Vivienne already contacted Alistair?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise sat focused in her car seat, absorbed in her picture book.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the car stopped, she yawned, her eyes growing misty with tiredness as her small, childish face peered out the window with a sleepy expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, her eyes lit up. She pointed excitedly through the window and shouted to Caroline, "Mom! I see Alistair!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After receiving the phone call, Alistair had just walked out of the building when he noticed a minivan slowly pulling up in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise's little head popped out from behind the lowered window. "Alistair!" she exclaimed. "We're seeing each other again so soon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair smiled at her, then opened the door and slipped into the back seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise looked confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The minivan smoothly pulled away, turned a corner, and merged into the steady flow of traffic on the road.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise twisted around in her seat, her face beaming with surprise. "Alistair, are you coming over to my house today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair nodded seriously. "Yes, I am. So tell me, Eloise, are you happy to have me visit your home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, of course I am!" Eloise could barely contain her excitement, waving her arms and legs. "Alistair, you're the first person ever to visit my house!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Really?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair couldn't hide his surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, as he looked at Caroline's cool demeanor, he seemed to understand why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Someone as reserved as her probably didn't have many friends. She had that unapproachable air about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alistair, when did you and my mom become such good friends?" Eloise asked. "If you're good friends with my mom, doesn't that mean we're good friends too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as Alistair was about to agree, Caroline cut in. "No, it doesn't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise's eager face crumpled in disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why not?" she asked, clearly hurt. "Is it just because you're grown-ups and I'm a kid? That means I can't be friends with Alistair?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline reached over to brush aside the hair that had blown across her daughter's forehead. "It's because from now on, you can't call him Alistair anymore. You need to call him Dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Really? This blunt?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd expected Caroline would take some time to ease Eloise into accepting his presence. He never imagined she'd handle it so directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise froze for what felt like ages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her little mind was racing to process this new information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair is suddenly going to be my dad? I have a dad now? I'm finally... going to have a dad?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And it's Alistair, my favorite person! This is amazing!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Did we scare her?" Alistair asked worriedly, watching Eloise's tense expression as she ran off the moment they got home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ever since Caroline had asked her to call him "Dad", Eloise hadn't spoken a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's fine," Caroline said, setting down her bag. She couldn't help but smile when she saw Alistair hesitating at the threshold. "Are you coming in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She placed a brand-new pair of men's slippers on the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair remembered how Caroline had told him he only needed to bring himself. She really had thought of everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her place was in the most luxurious neighborhood in New York, where each square foot cost tens of thousands more than Rebecca's spacious apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was just a ten-minute walk to the city's busiest district, right in the heart of New York.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unlike Rebecca's beloved princess-style decor, Caroline's home featured warm colors with every corner thoughtfully arranged to create a cozy atmosphere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This place is close to both my office and Eloise's future preschool," Caroline explained. "Since it's just the two of us, this smaller house feels more intimate. We'll stay here for the next few years, though if you think it's too small, we could always move somewhere larger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair thought Caroline was humble-bragging, but then realized he was being overly sensitive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was just stating facts. For a CEO making hundreds of millions annually, owning multiple large properties was perfectly normal, wasn't it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Still, Alistair was taken aback that Caroline was actually asking for his opinion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No need," he replied. "This place is perfect."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By his estimate, it was over 2,000 square feet, more than enough space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And it wasn't that he was being picky. He simply didn't like living in houses that were too big, especially with so few people. The emptiness made his heart feel hollow too, leaving him with a sense of insecurity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair glanced around, suddenly confronted with a question he couldn't avoid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Where would I sleep tonight?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He and Caroline were legally married, even without having gone through with the wedding ceremony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They might not have discussed any rules about what happens behind closed doors, but at the end of the day, their marriage was still nothing but a facade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline pointed to a door. "That's Eloise's room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair had guessed as much, since Eloise had immediately disappeared through that door when they arrived and had firmly closed it behind her. Who knew what she was up to in there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline then pointed to the door to the left of Eloise's. "That room is yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, Eloise's door swung open. "Mom, I want to get something yummy. Can I ask Alistair... I mean, can Dad take me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a quick correction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Caroline watched Eloise leading Alistair away by the hand, her feelings were all over the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now that she had a father, her daughter was forgetting about her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline couldn't deny feeling a twinge of jealousy. But mostly, she felt happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She could already see Eloise growing more attached to Alistair, forming a bond that would eventually make it impossible for him to leave them behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise's small hand fit snugly in Alistair's larger one as they walked together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He deliberately slowed his pace to accommodate her shorter legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he glanced down at her, she happened to look up at the same moment, their eyes meeting. Eloise stared at him with a curiously blank expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair decided to crouch down to her level. "Eloise, do you not want me to be your dad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise blinked in surprise, then shook her head vigorously, her little pigtails swinging from side to side. "That's not it at all! I'm super happy you're going to be my dad!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But you don't seem very happy," Alistair pointed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise looked down at her feet for a long moment before raising her head again. In her sweet, childish voice, she asked, "Ali&mdash;I mean, Dad, do you like my mom?"</p></div>
