        <h1>chapter 38 Call Him Honey</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had been addicted to the fake family life. If this were a dream, he hoped to maintain it forever and did not want to wake up so early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline added, "I don't even know what that guy looks like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The topic suddenly changed, and Alistair's brain couldn't keep up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I mean that man named Mr. Vaughn. I have nothing to do with him. Don't think too much about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally finding an opportunity to clarify, Caroline hurriedly explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as she finished speaking, she felt as if she had washed off a spot of mud that someone had accidentally thrown at her, and the depressed feeling in her heart finally dissipated a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair looked around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise was sitting on the swing in the garden, while Mabel was sitting beside her reading a story to her. Julian had disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Except for Mabel who looked up at them from time to time, Alistair was sure that no one noticed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair wanted to say, "You don't need to explain this to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On second thought, he paused.<br>Would a real husband not care if his wife is pursued by another man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Considering the one-million-dollar payment a month, I really need to learn from Caroline and get into the role so as to avoid being seen through accidentally.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He followed her words and pretended to be relieved. "Really? Then I feel relieved."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline blinked her eyes. "So, honey, have you forgiven me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, she could fluently and naturally call him "honey."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the contrary, Alistair was not used to hearing that. He was unsure how he should respond to that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he accepted that, he'd be considered to be taking advantage of her, but if he didn't, he'd be considered unprofessional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the final analysis, it was because he had the wrong mindset and had too many messy thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline, however, was calm and open-minded, and she was not as shy as him, so she could call him honey without any psychological burden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, he had no idea that Caroline had ulterior motives toward him from the first moment she saw him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair replied, "It's not you who did anything wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline said, "Honey, why are you so considerate? I love you even more!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, she smiled at Alistair. That smile made the colorful blossoms behind her pale in comparison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair's heart suddenly stopped, and his mind was in a mess. "Uh, I-I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline waited patiently for his reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair couldn't even finish a sentence after a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline moved closer unwillingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Under the bright sunlight, her skin was as smooth as a baby's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her expectation made Alistair feel that if he continued to hesitate like this, he would be like an unforgivable scumbag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He made up his mind and replied, "I love you too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was like a sharp blade soaked in a deadly hallucinogen, piercing Caroline's heart in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline stared at Alistair blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The blood in her body suddenly coagulated, her mind went blank, and the entire colorful world became a huge backdrop. At this moment, there was only Alistair in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was a little embarrassed at first, and Caroline's surprised reaction made him feel at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be that I'm too immersed in the role and don't know how to control myself?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The word love is so sacred and noble. How can we say it casually?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But Caroline can say, and why can't I...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline quickly came back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed as if her absent-mindedness was just Alistair's illusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline asked, "That's all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair stared at her with a confused face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She added, "Remember to add the word 'baby' next time, otherwise, who will know who you really love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was left speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Caroline gave her instructions in a serious tone, she turned her head and looked at the scenery as if nothing had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gradually, a blush crept up on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though she knew that Alistair said so under her "force" and what Alistair said just now was not his real thoughts, Caroline didn't care. Anyway, Alistair said he loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel looked at them who were huddled together and whispering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt that she was full of contradictions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Caroline kept to herself, Mabel worried that she would be alone for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Caroline found her ideal husband as she wished, Mabel felt very uncomfortable for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All in all, it happened too suddenly, and she didn't have any time to prepare herself mentally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one would be used to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline stroked Eloise's face lovingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is a poor child, but she is also very lucky to have met Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel asked, "Eloise, do you like your dad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise held a bottle and sipped it. She nodded vigorously after hearing this. "Of course I like him. My dad is so nice!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel smiled and said, "Well, as long as you both like him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The only thing Mabel could do was to send her blessings to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After lunch, Mabel pulled her usual trick&mdash;sending Caroline and Eloise off under some pretense, leaving Alistair behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline glanced helplessly at Alistair before sighing, "Grandma..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, relax," Mabel said with a wave of her hand. "I just want a word with Alistair. I'm not going to bite him. Right, Alistair?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'll be fine," Alistair said gently, offering Caroline a reassuring smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the moment she walked out, the confidence left him. He sat awkwardly on the edge of the couch, back ramrod straight like a student kept after class for unfinished homework.</p></div>
