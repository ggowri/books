        <h1>chapter 36 Confrontation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair asked in a low voice, "Eloise, do you know her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise hugged his legs with a timid expression. "Yes, she said I was a burden to my mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was stunned upon hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he turned his head and looked at the middle-aged woman again, a hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It turned out to be this woman!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair said, "Eloise, can you wait for Daddy here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise nodded obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair strode towards the middle-aged woman who was about to turn around and leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey," he called to the woman without patience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought women who could say such sarcastic words to a well-behaved and cute little girl were definitely not good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Besides, Alistair found her sneaky behavior suspicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The middle-aged woman was stunned for a moment. Then she turned around and smiled respectfully on her harsh face, "Mr. Harlow, what can I do for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair remembered that when he and Caroline came in together, it was this woman who served them water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He shook his phone and smiled helplessly, "I want to make a call, but my phone is out of battery. Can you lend me your phone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was a common request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unlike meeting a stranger on the street, Alistair was a distinguished guest here. The distinguished guest just wanted to borrow her phone, and under normal circumstances, his request would be granted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, as soon as he finished speaking, a trace of discomfort appeared on the middle-aged woman's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She gave a dry laugh. "Sorry, Mr. Harlow, my phone is out of credit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh," Alistair muttered, "what a coincidence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The middle-aged woman breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair looked at her with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was smiling, but there was no trace of gentleness in his eyes. "Is it that your phone is out of credit, or the photos secretly taken by you have not been processed yet and can't be seen by me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The middle-aged woman was shocked and subconsciously refuted, "I don't understand what you are saying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was originally uncertain, but now, her reaction made Alistair certain that his guess was correct.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had just secretly taken photos of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian finished the call and walked over, holding Eloise's hand. "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dude, I don't know why she secretly took some photos of Eloise and me," Alistair replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian was confused. "Agnes, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes Crowley had recovered from the panic she felt when she was exposed at the beginning, and she said with a sad look, "No, I didn't take any photos. Mr. Harlow is new here, so it's okay if he doesn't know me, but you know me, Julian!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She became more and more excited. "The flowers are in bloom here, and I thought they were beautiful, so I took some pictures. Even if Mr. Harlow and Eloise were included in the picture, it was an accidental act. If Mr. Harlow insists that I took the pictures secretly, then I will have no way to defend myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian looked at Alistair in embarrassment. "Uh, is there some misunderstanding here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian felt like it was normal to take pictures of beautiful scenery. Under normal circumstances, Alistair would feel that he was making a fuss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, when Alistair learned what Agnes had said to Eloise and the trace of panic that she hadn't fully concealed when facing him, he was certain that there was something wrong with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In short, he felt very uneasy as he couldn't figure out why she took the photos of them secretly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair didn't waste any time and directly called Caroline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline soon came to the garden with Mabel behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, Agnes had already started crying. She lowered her head and wiped her tears, looking extremely aggrieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For those who didn't know the whole thing, it almost seemed like Alistair was a villain who was cocky here. He thought that since he married Caroline, he could take advantage of his power and step on others at will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel asked with a confused look, "What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes sobbed and repeated to them what she had just said to Julian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She also said that she had never been wronged like this before, and she wanted to resign.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After learning about this matter, they felt like Alistair was relying on his status to make trouble unreasonably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel was in deep thought and did not express her opinion immediately, so Julian maintained a neutral attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline then said, "Could you please take out your phone and show it to us? If my husband wronged you, I will apologize to you on his behalf and give you ten years' salary as compensation. What do you think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair looked at Caroline in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't even ask him before making up her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Perhaps the compensation of ten years' salary was not worth mentioning in her mind with her annual income of nine figures, but it had nothing to do with money. Anyone could understand Caroline's trust in Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes stammered, "M-My phone is out of battery."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair bluntly exposed her lies. "You just said your phone was out of credit, and now it's out of battery? No matter how coincidental, everything can't happen at the same time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel also stared at Agnes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was usually kind and easy-going, but that didn't mean she was stupid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes' unnatural look was enough to show that she had something to hide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel was about to say something when Caroline glanced at Agnes indifferently. "I'll give you an opportunity to tell the truth. Three, two, one. Sorry, you missed it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair tried to hold back his smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In just a second, Caroline finished her countdown, and she had no intention of giving Agnes any chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the cool and comfortable spring, Agnes' forehead began to sweat.</p></div>
