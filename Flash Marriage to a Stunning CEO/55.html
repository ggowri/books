        <h1>Chapter 55 Love You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's clothes were in his own room. As he came out after changing, he ran into Eloise, who had just gotten out of bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise froze in surprise. "Dad, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair quickly explained, "I slept in Mom's room last night, but all my clothes are in here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise's face brightened with understanding. "Oh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she asked, confused, "Dad, couldn't you just bring your clothes to Mom's bedroom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair gave an awkward laugh. "I was being silly. I didn't think of that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thank goodness he wasn't driving today, or he'd be a hazard on the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dropping Eloise off at preschool, he returned home to find Caroline had already left for work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair immediately retreated to his neglected bedroom, yawning as he flopped onto the bed to catch up on sleep. Just then, Caroline called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alistair, to help Eloise feel more secure, I'm having someone come over today to renovate your room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It hit him like a thunderbolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair remembered Caroline had indeed said this yesterday, but after a night of tossing and turning, his mind had turned to mush and he'd forgotten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman running five companies certainly lived up to her reputation. When Caroline made decisions, she didn't waste time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was miserable, but he didn't dare object. "Fine," he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, someone showed up that day and carted away his beloved bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That afternoon, Eloise came home from school with "good news". "Zoe isn't a child of divorce anymore! Her parents made up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was speechless. His resentment ran deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why did Zoe's parents have to fight in the first place? Their drama had cost me my own bedroom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In all fairness, Alistair was being somewhat ungrateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During his marriage to Rebecca, her friend Anne was constantly stirring up trouble, always urging Rebecca to be on guard around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd say things like, "You two are living under the same roof and spending so much time together. Don't let him develop feelings for you or try anything inappropriate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Rebecca were the last woman on earth, he wouldn't want her! Her paranoia was off the charts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both then and now, Alistair always remembered his responsibilities and mission. He would never do anything that would make him lose respect for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wouldn't dare entertain inappropriate thoughts about her. Caroline was worlds above him, and he knew better than to overstep those boundaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before dinner, Caroline called to say she was busy and working late, telling them to get to bed early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The housekeeper left after giving Eloise her bath. Probably tired from staying up late yesterday, Eloise climbed into bed just after eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was so exhausted he could barely keep his eyes open. He instinctively walked toward his old room, only to find it completely torn apart for renovations that would take days. His eye twitched as he quietly backed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All his clothes had been moved to the walk-in closet in Caroline's bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Eloise's happiness, both he and Caroline had made so many sacrifices, except for the intimacy real married couples shared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Alistair didn't realize was that he was the only one being sacrificed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had been planning to slowly seduce him into this situation all along. Eloise had merely accelerated the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After his shower, Alistair sat on the edge of the bed and called Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the phone rang, he had second thoughts.</span><br><span>Caroline is always swamped with work. Will my call interrupt her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While he was overthinking this, she picked up. "Hey, honey? What's up?" Caroline's voice came through the receiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair immediately sensed she wasn't alone. Otherwise, she wouldn't have deliberately called him "honey".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly played along. "The maid left. When are you coming home? Want me to make you a late-night snack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No need," Caroline replied. "I already ate at the office. Is Eloise asleep?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, she's out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good. You should get some sleep too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure. Don't work yourself too hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I know. Love you, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When those words "love you, honey" traveled through the signal and out of the speaker, Alistair felt a tingle run through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if they really were a devoted newlywed couple, missing each other terribly after just one day apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up, Alistair couldn't help but scratch his tingling ear before collapsing onto the bed to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Caroline sat alone in her silent office, her back to the massive floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the glittering cityscape of New York.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair wasn't the only one shocked by her "love you, honey" comment. It had caught her off guard, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cheeks burned hot as the words slipped out naturally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Have I gotten too caught up in the moment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not exactly, she was just rehearsing for the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someday soon, she'd be able to tell Alistair how much she loved him face-to-face, every day. And she'd expect him to say "love you, honey" right back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hmph. After I said "love you," wasn't it only fair for Alistair to respond with "love you too"? That blockhead is unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline stewed in her resentment for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't actually have any work that required overtime. She could have gone home at her normal time like any other day. But just as Eloise needed an adjustment period when she first started preschool, Caroline figured she should give Alistair a trial period too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The office had emptied out. Julian had left too. His parents had arranged a blind date for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't had his fill of single life yet and didn't want to go. He'd planned to use overtime as an excuse, but Caroline ruthlessly told his mother on the phone, "Mrs. Hart, there's no overtime tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian left, shooting her the most pitiful look. Before heading out, he asked curiously, "Ms. Ashbourne, it's only been a few days and you're already bored with your husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline smiled sweetly, "I just remembered my grandmother knows even more people. Would you like me to ask her to set something up for you instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian's face went pale as he made a hasty exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline stayed at the office until eleven before finally driving herself home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she pulled up to her building, she glanced up to see the lights glowing warmly from her windows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A small smile tugged at her lips. Alistair had left the lights on for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the spring evening's warmth, there was still a slight chill in the air. The golden glow from her windows sent a wave of comfort washing over her heart. Her footsteps toward the elevator unconsciously quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was already eleven-thirty. Eloise would be fast asleep by now, but what about Alistair? He clearly hadn't slept well last night. The dark circles under his eyes had been a dead giveaway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he sleeping now too?</span></p></div>
