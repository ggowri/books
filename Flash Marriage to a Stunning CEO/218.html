        <h1>Chapter 218 Birthday Gifts</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by, and before anyone knew it, </span><span>Eloise's birthday had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her birthday fell in autumn, and this year, even Gordon, who had missed countless birthdays, including his own daughter Caroline's, showed up without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month before the big day, Caroline had asked Eloise what kind</span><span> of birthday she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of her classmates had rented a private island and invited the entire kindergarten to a massive party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another child's parents had gone as far as renting a real castle overseas so she could live out her dream of being a princess</span><span>&mdash;complete with a crown and a dramatic entrance, greeted by a crowd shouting, "Happy birthday!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing was off-limits for the Ashbourne family. As long as it wasn't something like flying to the moon, they had the means to make any wish come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Elois</span><span>e, shaped by her parents' personalities, was quiet and low-key.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her birthday wish was simple&mdash;she wanted everyone in the family together for a happy dinner. And she insisted it be at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, no place in the world was more comfortable than home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She di</span><span>dn't want to invite classmates either. A big crowd would be too noisy, and if she invited only a few, the rest might feel left out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So on the most important day of her year, Eloise chose to spend it with the people who meant the most to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't nee</span><span>d a castle to be a princess. That day, she sparkled all on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone brought gifts for the birthday girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most extravagant gift came from her grandfather, Gordon. Knowing how much Eloise loved reading, he gifted her a private library.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most </span><span>romantic gift came from Leo, who wrote and composed a song just for her&mdash;a sweet, melodic piece titled Dear Darling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that signature voice of his, Leo sang every note like a blessing, wishing her a life full of laughter and love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everyone had prese</span><span>nted their gifts, the room suddenly went dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While everyone sat puzzled in the shadows, Alistair's voice echoed through the living room. "Since everyone else has given their gifts, I guess it's my turn now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right on cue, the television lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A </span><span>line of glittery words appeared on screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise read it out loud, beaming, "Happy Birthday, Eloise! May you grow up happy and healthy. Daddy loves you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the message faded, the screen switched to a group of animated characters singing Happy Birthday ar</span><span>ound a little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise's eyes went wide. She ran up to the screen and started pointing excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Daddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Mommy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Great-grandma!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Grandpa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's my teddy bear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! And that's Uncle Leo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, pointing to the cen</span><span>ter of the screen. "That's me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she tilted her head, puzzled. "Wait... I drew these people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned, correcting herself. "No, no... I mean, I've drawn them before, but this... this isn't my drawing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was too excited and confused to even </span><span>form full sentences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair knelt beside her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. "All the characters in that animation were designed by you, Eloise. I had someone turn your drawings into a cartoon for your birthday. Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love it! I love</span><span> it so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the birthday song ended and the animated Eloise blew out her candles, the story took a turn&mdash;the animation continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A full episode began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had secretly created a custom cartoon series for her. Ten episode</span><span>s in total, starring Eloise as the main character.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gift, much like Leo's, had been tailor-made for her&mdash;except Alistair had used his own strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was a master of lyrics and music. Alistair... well, maybe storytelling was his gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe he really </span><span>did have a knack for it, since the way he wrote that animated series from a child's perspective didn't just captivate Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the adults were watching, fully absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And not out of politeness&mdash;Alistair could tell they were genuinely enjoying it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>series wasn't long. Ten short episodes told the tale of a little fairy who accidentally fell to Earth and teamed up with a homeless brown bear to survive in the </span><span>human world. After a series of magical misadventures, the fairy found a home and a loving famil</span><span>y. A family of three, living happily ever after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline leaned in and whispered, "You started planning this for Eloise a while ago, right? So how did Leo end up in the beginning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair first started the project, Leo was still </span><span>considered somewhat of an outsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That part was added this month," Alistair replied, glancing discreetly in Leo's direction and lowering his voice. "Everyone else is in it. If he weren't, he'd feel left out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline hugged his arm and whispered, "You'</span><span>re the sweetest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, is that cartoon just for me?" Eloise asked, still wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair nodded. "Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I share it with the other kids?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely. That's up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian chimed in with a grin, "Alistair, that cartoon's pretty impres</span><span>sive. Even I enjoyed it. Honestly, you could pitch it to a children's network or a streaming platform."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise's eyes sparkled. "Really? Does that mean every kid could see the gift Daddy made for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she had a little vanity in her. She loved Alistair</span><span>'s gift so much, she wanted every kid to know that her dad was cooler than Superman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A week later, the cartoon&mdash;now officially titled The Adventures of Elle the Little Fairy&mdash;was launched on major platforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The animation style was simple, but that only made</span><span> it more charming. Elle, the heroine, was brave, kind, clever, and resilient. The storyline was rich with twists and heart. And when she finally ran into her new parents' arms and cried, "I have a family now!"&mdash;more than one young viewer teared up right alo</span><span>ng with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had started as a private gift unexpectedly went viral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Adventures of Elle the Little Fairy had become a hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Alistair hadn't thought much of it&mdash;until one day, Yves muttered under his breath, "Man, I just got roasted by my fi</span><span>rst-grade nephew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair raised an eyebrow. "What for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves let out a sigh. "He asked me to get a signed poster from the director of The Adventures of Elle the Little Fairy. I said I didn't know the guy. He said I was useless. Apparently, even the kids</span><span> from other classes know who directed it, and I don't even know someone from my own industry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair fought back a laugh. "Well, you should've said something sooner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves blinked. "Wait, don't tell me you know the guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave a modest shrug. "K</span><span>now him? We're actually pretty close... in fact, it's me."</span></p></div>
