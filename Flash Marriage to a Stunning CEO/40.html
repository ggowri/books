        <h1>Chapter 40 Play Dirtier</h1>
        <div><p>He didn&#x27;t hesitate for a second to buy it.</p><p>The credits were a gift from the system anyway, a reward for making the right choice earlier. If he could stop the Ashbourne family from walking into a disaster because of it, then the price was more than worth it.</p><p>&quot;Target locked—Agnes Crowley.&quot;</p><p>As the system&#x27;s calm voice echoed in his mind, a new one followed—cold, sharp, and filled with bitterness.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ve worked for the Ashbourne family for years. Even if I haven&#x27;t earned their praise, I should have earned their damn respect, shouldn&#x27;t I? Nobody&#x27;s perfect. So I made some mistakes—does that mean I don&#x27;t deserve a second chance? Just like that, I&#x27;m out? Fired without so much as a thank-you? Heartless.&quot;</p><p>Alistair picked up his coffee cup without flinching, hiding his rising tension behind a calm facade.</p><p><em>Wow. She&#x27;s really bitter.</em></p><p>Not only did Agnes not regret her actions, but she was actively resenting the family for holding her accountable. There was no remorse—only spite.</p><p>&quot;Fine. They want to play rough? I&#x27;ll play dirtier. Let&#x27;s see how high and mighty they are when it all comes crashing down.&quot;</p><p><em>So she really is planning something.</em></p><p>Alistair couldn&#x27;t understand it—was this woman insane?</p><p>The Ashbournes weren&#x27;t just wealthy. They held real power. If anything went wrong, if even a sliver of this was exposed, she wouldn&#x27;t just be in trouble—she&#x27;d be destroyed.</p><p>This was the kind of plan that hurt both sides. There was nothing to gain from it, not for her. Not unless she had a death wish.</p><p>But Alistair didn&#x27;t believe she was that kind of person. She wasn&#x27;t stupid.</p><p>The more he heard, the more uneasy he became. She was clearly planning something—but what exactly? That part still eluded him. He had no choice but to keep listening, forcing himself to stay patient, hoping she&#x27;d eventually give herself away.</p><p>&quot;Madam Ashbourne, thank you for everything these past years,&quot; Agnes said aloud, her voice trembling with fake sentiment. &quot;I&#x27;ll be going now.&quot;</p><p>Mabel nodded without looking at her. She wasn&#x27;t going to drag out the departure with bitterness. Agnes had served her family long enough. A little dignity, even undeserved, cost nothing.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Vaughn promised me a cushy job once this is done. No stress, good pay. All I need is for this plan to work. Please, God, let it work.</p><p>&quot;My sister hasn&#x27;t found work since Caroline fired her. Word got around. Someone made sure of it. Probably her. I came today just to see the old hag one last time. Hopefully she&#x27;ll take pity on me and not blacklist me for good. Otherwise, not even Mr. Vaughn can save me.&quot;</p><p><em>Wait—Mr. Vaughn? Preston Vaughn?</em></p><p>That name hit like ice water to the face.</p><p><em>Of course. Caroline&#x27;s so-called admirer. So this whole thing is tied to him?</em></p><p>And Agnes&#x27; sister...</p><p>Alistair&#x27;s mind raced, and suddenly the pieces fell into place. Caroline had once fired a woman who looked eerily similar to Agnes.</p><p>They were sisters.</p><p>That explained everything.</p><p><em>No wonder this feels personal.</em></p><p>The scheme was deeper than he&#x27;d thought. He leaned back slightly, heart pounding now, trying not to miss a word.</p><p>Thankfully, the voice in his mind wasn&#x27;t bound by volume or noise.</p><p>Agnes&#x27; thoughts came through with stunning clarity.</p><p>She turned away with a respectful nod, her demeanor impeccable, and began walking off. On the surface, Alistair remained calm, unreadable—but inside, frustration gnawed at him.</p><p><em>What the hell are you planning? Come on, just say it already.</em></p><p>Agnes&#x27; eyes flicked back in his direction, seemingly by chance. She smiled, sweet and practiced.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m truly sorry, Mr. Harlow. I didn&#x27;t mean anything by it... I made a mistake, and I hope you can forgive me.&quot;</p><p>If Alistair hadn&#x27;t been listening in on her internal monologue, he might&#x27;ve actually believed her.</p><p>Instead, he returned her fake sincerity with a matching smile.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s all in the past.&quot;</p><p>Agnes&#x27; inner thoughts emerged in his mind again. &quot;As if. He really thinks he belongs here? What a joke. Even if Madam Ashbourne approves of him, he&#x27;ll never get past Mr. Ashbourne.&quot;</p><p><em>Mr. Ashbourne... that must be Caroline&#x27;s father.</em></p><p>Alistair wasn&#x27;t particularly concerned with the man&#x27;s approval.</p><p>But what came next nearly made his blood freeze.</p><p>&quot;Once Madam Ashbourn falls into the lake and Vaughn swoops in to save her, Caroline will have no choice but to be grateful. She won&#x27;t be able to refuse him after that.&quot;</p><p><em>What! That&#x27;s the plan? They&#x27;re going to... stage an accident?</em></p><p>Apparently, there had once been a pond on the manor, but it had been filled in when Eloise arrived. Caroline had been worried about her falling in while playing, so they turned it into a kids&#x27; play area.</p><p>Which meant... the lake must be outside the property grounds.</p><p>&quot;And when Madam Ashbourn ends up in that water, everyone will look at this lucky bastard—this walking curse who showed up just in time for things to go wrong. Let&#x27;s see how well that sits with the family.&quot;</p><p>Agnes finally left the room, and Alistair sat there, calculating.</p><p><em>So it&#x27;s an outside lake. Makes sense.</em></p><p>But what nagged at him was how confident Agnes had sounded.<br/>How does she know Mabel will go there today? She&#x27;s not the type to just wander lakeside on a whim... is she?</p><p>It wasn&#x27;t impossible.</p><p>If that was the case, then keeping Mabel away from the water should be simple enough—as long as he had a good reason to do it.</p><p>From what he&#x27;d heard in her thoughts, Preston hadn&#x27;t given up. He was still trying to stage some grand gesture, some setup to get closer to Caroline.</p><p>He probably didn&#x27;t intend to hurt Mabel—not really. But if something went wrong, if the rescue didn&#x27;t happen fast enough, who knew how bad it could get?</p><p>Alistair pulled out his phone and ran a quick search. Sure enough, there was a lake less than half a mile from the house.</p><p>Just then, Mabel called out cheerfully, &quot;Eloise, come on, let&#x27;s go feed the fish!&quot;</p><p>Alistair snapped to attention. &quot;Feed the fish?&quot; he echoed, trying to sound casual.</p><p>Caroline nodded, completely unaware of his rising alarm. &quot;Yeah, Eloise asked Grandma to take her. They made plans last time. That lake&#x27;s full of fish.&quot;</p><p><em>That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s how they knew.</em></p><p>Agnes must&#x27;ve overheard the plan and fed the info straight to Preston. He, in turn, spun it into an opportunity to win Caroline over—an &quot;accidental&quot; fall, a heroic save, and a forced debt of gratitude.</p><p>The skies were clear, and the sun was bright—it was a perfect day for an outing. And that was exactly what made it so dangerous.</p><p>Eloise&#x27;s face lit up with excitement, practically bouncing in place. Alistair couldn&#x27;t find it in himself to stop her.</p><p>&quot;I haven&#x27;t been feeding anything in ages,&quot; he said, feigning enthusiasm.</p><p>Eloise turned to him, eyes wide with hope. &quot;Then come with us, Daddy! Please?&quot;</p></div>
