        <h1>Chapter 37 Alistair Said He Loved Her</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Vaughn: [Today is Saturday. Has Ms. Ashbourne gone home?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes: [Yes.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Vaughn sent a screenshot of a transfer to Agnes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes: [But Ms. Ashbourne brought a man back today.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Vaughn panicked and sent a 60-second voice note.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes replied: [OK, I'll take a picture and send it to you.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Vaughn sent another screenshot of a transfer and replied: [Thanks a lot.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The so-called Mr. Vaughn Agnes chatted with was a suitor of Caroline named Preston Vaughn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Preston was madly obsessed with Caroline. He was tossing and turning every night because he couldn't get the love he wanted. He even bribed someone around Mabel to pass on relevant information about Caroline to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon learning that Caroline, who was always aloof and unapproachable, had brought a man back home for the first time, Preston panicked and asked Agnes to secretly take some photos of Alistair. He wanted to investigate who dared to snatch a woman from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel was kind-hearted. She usually didn't care if the nannies broke things or did something wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But since someone betrayed their family and leaked their privacy to outsiders, Mabel couldn't stand it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She got angry immediately and told Agnes to pack up and leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes begged for mercy in tears, "Madam Ashbourne, Ms. Ashbourne! I was wrong. I shouldn't have betrayed you for a little favor. Please forgive me since it's my first time making a mistake. I swear I won't do it again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One betrayal was enough to see a person clearly. When it came to such important issues, Mabel was no pushover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that there was no room for maneuver, Agnes left the scene sadly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel was furious. "Blacklist that Vaughn guy and never allow him to set foot here again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The housekeeper lowered his eyes and replied, "Yes, Madam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's your first day here. I'm sorry for what happened..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as Mabel started to speak, she was interrupted by Caroline. "Grandma, he is not a stranger. Why are you being so polite to him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel was left speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She still looked at Alistair with loving eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her expressions were different from the ones she had when she was with Caroline, as if she weren't unsatisfied with the man Caroline had married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alistair, thank you. Otherwise, we'd keep such a treacherous person in the house, and it would be a disaster sooner or later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel felt uncomfortable when she thought that someone was spying on them in the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if the other party had no ill intentions and just tried to achieve certain goals by playing petty tricks, she still felt terrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Besides, no one could be sure that they had no ill intentions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After this incident, Mabel began to re-examine Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe I should let go of my prejudice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Excellence should not be reflected solely by academic qualifications, family background, etc.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This young man Carol likes is not only good-looking, but also has strong insight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Isn't this an advantage that others don't have?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone present looked at Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair looked down at Eloise, who never left his side, unwilling to take credit for the success. "In fact, it was Eloise who made me alert."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Eloise saw Agnes, she showed her nervousness and timidity, which made Alistair subconsciously alert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline was extremely annoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This happened the first time I brought Alistair back. Will it leave a bad influence on him? What if he feels that entering a wealthy family is terrible, or let him mistakenly think that I'm flirting with others...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline seemed to see that on the road to guiding her into Alistair's heart, there were two more obstacles that could not be ignored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The excellent CEO, Caroline, who was calm and composed, wanted to clarify everything, but she knew this was obviously not a good time to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline wished she could cut Agnes into pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes begged that it was getting late, and she wanted to leave tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel remained unmoved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Under the supervision of the housekeeper, she went to her room to pack her things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she left, she seemed to glance over here unintentionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair caught her gaze by accident, and his heart started beating for no reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unrest surged like a tidal wave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had a bad feeling that something was going to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The wind brought him the faint fragrance that he had been familiar with for a few days. Caroline walked to his side and looked over at him. "What are you thinking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair shook his head. "Nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the end, it was just his vague intuition, lacking any evidence to support it.<br>What if I'm just overthinking it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's mood dropped a little because of his nonchalant reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline frowned.<br>There's obviously something going on, but he just doesn't want to tell me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline tucked the loose hair behind her ears and said, "Alistair, luckily there are only two of us right now; otherwise, they would have figured out something was up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was stunned. "Sorry, I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline replied, "Real couples won't apologize all the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair didn't know how to reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He suddenly felt that Caroline was a bit harsh. After all, they were not a real husband and wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if they were a real couple, they had known each other for just a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline then explained, "Don't get me wrong. I just want to remind you that you should be careful with your actions in front of my grandma. If we are too polite to each other..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She suddenly leaned over and whispered, "My grandma has very sharp eyes. If we are not careful, she may find out the truth, and then all our efforts will be in vain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her breath sprayed on Alistair's face. Alistair paused and felt that the air around him had become a lot thinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Subconsciously, he wanted to take a step back to distance himself, but someone passed by, and he held back. "Okay, I'll be more careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was a little nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't imagine if their relationship was exposed...</p></div>
