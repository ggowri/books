        <h1>Chapter 195 The Reason to Keep Going</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige sat opposite Leo and poured herself a cup of coffee. A sneer appeared on her face. "I'm not gonna accept a woman who loves to cause a ruckus and turn our family upside down. Sure, our family might not be top-tier, but we're not letting just any hick into the family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo fixed Paige with a cold, piercing stare. He enunciated each word deliberately. "I've never even brought Miley up to you. How come you not only know she exists but also know all about her background?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she realized it was fishy that she knew so much about Miley. She should've had no clue about Miley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat broke out on her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was no fool. Her eyes darted around for a moment, and then she quickly came up with an answer. "Um, it was..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Ezra tell you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige nodded frantically. "Yeah, yeah. Ezra told me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You planted Ezra beside me. You made him watch my every move as my assistant, noting who I talked to and who I was interested in. That's how you found out about Miley right away. A country bumpkin like her? How could she ever be good enough for you, the son of a professor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I went out on a sudden errand. Oh, I remember! I said I wanted to go home that day, and you asked me to get your favorite sandwiches from that shop early in the morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Leo talked, he attempted a half-hearted smile, but it twisted his face into a grimace that was far more pitiful than a sob. "I got out of the hotel bed at six in the morning. Drove for almost an hour round-trip to that sandwich place to get you those sandwiches. I was even planning to pick up Miley around seven and take her back to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige just sat there, mute as a fish, not a single word coming out of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I got back to the hotel, Miley was gone. She took off so fast that she didn't even leave me a note or anything. I was left there, totally confused."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo fixed Paige with a mocking stare. "Then, later on, I found out the truth. You were the one who told Ezra to go to her and say that there were a bunch of women all over me, and that I was only with her because she was this pure, fresh-faced girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you made Ezra give her some cash and tell her to stay away from me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you know me. I've always been a good guy. There've been loads of women trying to get with me, but I've never given them the time of day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miley's the only girl I've ever fallen head-over-heels for in my entire life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you break us up so cruelly? Why did you make me look like a heartless jerk?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Leo's increasingly blood-shot gaze, Paige felt so guilty that she hardly dared to look him in the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at this point, she still hoped to shift the blame. "Did Ezra tell you all this? He's lying. I have no idea what you're talking about! That brat is trying to drive a wedge between us. Don't be fooled by him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo laughed sardonically, "Don't you remember? You just praised Ezra for being honest and hard-working. Would such an honest and hard-working guy lie to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had shot herself in the foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted her actions. She never thought this would ever come to light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had overestimated Ezra's loyalty to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Ezra had been loyal to her. If it hadn't been for Alistair and Caroline, Leo would still be kept in the dark, flying like a kite with the string in Paige's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Alistair and the others do wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was out of their own self-interest or for Leo's well-being, they were right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was an adult who needed freedom and independence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he break his own wings, give up his freedom, and bid farewell to his previous happiness just to satisfy his mother's sick sense of control?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he even woke up to the truth, his happiness had already been brutally snuffed out by his mother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo felt as if he were living in hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leo, Leo! I know I was wrong. It was my fault. I shouldn't have been so prejudiced against that girl. How about this? Where is she now? I will go and apologize to her right away. I won't stop you two from being together. I'll treat her like my own daughter. I promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Leo turn around and walk away in despair, Paige was completely panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline might ignore her as an aunt, Mabel might give her the cold shoulder as a daughter, and Gordon might turn a blind eye to her. But Leo was her son, the pride of her life. He couldn't ignore her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his fit of rage, Leo slumped back into the same state of dejection that Alistair had seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With empty eyes, he let out a cold, sarcastic laugh. "Fine, then go ahead and bring her back from down there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, son. I'll send someone to fetch her right away. No, wait. I'll go get her myself. Where is she? Down... down..." Paige suddenly trailed off, her eyes widening in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo turned his head and stared at her blankly. "Yeah, down there. She's gone. She died five years ago. Are you happy now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, who usually held herself so gracefully, staggered and crumpled to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did she know at that moment, Leo's arrival was just the start of this horrible day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, sir! This is a private property. No trespassing. If you try to come in again, I'll call the cops!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the house, as Leo walked away apathetically, he heard the butler trying to stop someone at the courtyard gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just kept moving forward, like a walking ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was merely going through the motions of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his past achievements now seemed utterly meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt so wretched that he believed he didn't even deserve to live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing that stopped him from ending his life after being struck by the triple blows of grief, a shattered worldview, and deep disappointment in his mother was the news that Miley had left him a daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That little girl was the sole reason he kept going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo searched for his daughter like a madman, forgetting to eat or sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ezra was horrified by his state and pleaded with him through tears. "Come on. Eat something, or at least have a drink of water. You'll drop dead otherwise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ezra felt incredibly remorseful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he wasn't the mastermind, he was an accomplice, and the guilt weighed heavily on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Leo's perseverance paid off. He got the exact information that his daughter had been adopted by a young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally calmed down and waved Ezra away, the nearly thirty-year-old Ezra broke down like a little kid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to stay and make amends for his mistakes, but Leo didn't need him around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he made his way back, Leo's mind was in a whirl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd heard that the girl who adopted his daughter was stunningly beautiful, a city girl, and quite well-off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, he couldn't help but think of Caroline.</span></p></div>
