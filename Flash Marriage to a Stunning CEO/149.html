        <h1>Chapter 149 Her Own Tangled Trap</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The video was sharp and perfectly clear. And it showed exactly what Alistair had said. He and his wife were just strolling through the park, hand in hand. As they got close to the fountain, Freya came walking toward them. But while she was still a good few feet away from them, she suddenly just sort of wobbled and then pitched headfirst right into the water!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole time, they never laid a finger on her. They didn't even speak to her. In fact, right before Freya took her unplanned dip, Alistair and Caroline hadn't even spared her a single glance!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was right there, plain as day, for everyone to see. Freya's face went a ghastly shade of pale. The self-righteous mob that had been vehemently baying for Alistair's blood just stood there, mouths agape.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair faced the officer. "Officer, you saw it. This group, led by Ms. Peterson, launched a vicious, unprovoked attack on my wife and me. If that bodyguard hadn't luckily filmed it, with them all ganging up and lying, we'd have been screwed. No way to clear our names."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer turned, his expression stern, looking from Freya to the now-silent crowd. "Well? Your explanation?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freya was floored, looking like she'd been hit by a truck.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She honestly had no idea how she'd gone from walking fine one second to taking an involuntary swim in the fountain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her whole focus had been on proving her love for her boyfriend. The harebrained plan? Stage a bump and fall, a classic fake injury, then use her huge fanbase to pressure whoever pissed off her boyfriend into a groveling apology.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Okay, falling early had thrown her, made her panic. But weirdly, the result was even better, more dramatic, than her original plan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, just the three of them were there. But the instant she struck her most pathetic, tearful damsel-in-distress pose, every onlooker automatically assumed she was the victim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, moments ago so aggressively testifying for Freya, now panicked, their faces paling, desperately trying to distance themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair's words painted their actions as something far more serious, verging on a coordinated mob attack, maybe even harassment. So, the local cops rounded them all up and hauled them to the station for investigation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freya, truly caught in her own tangled trap, was a blubbering, hysterical mess, frantically calling for backup.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Leo, decked out in full celebrity-incognito gear, mask, sunglasses, and the works, strode into the police station.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spotting Caroline and Alistair, he did a visible double-take, and he was clearly surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he got the full, unvarnished story, he rounded on Freya, voice tight. "Who the hell told you to do this? What were you thinking?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freya, face a mess of tears and makeup, pointed a trembling, accusatory finger at Caroline, voice cracking. "Is she the one you're so completely, pathetically obsessed with?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair just sighed, exasperated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously? Could this get any more ridiculous?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Okay, so apparently, this is the convoluted backstory.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo, it turned out, was secretly, desperately pining for some unattainable dream girl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he and Freya even started, he'd been brutally honest. He'd flat-out told her he only noticed her because her vibe slightly resembled his precious, unrequited love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Freya, bless her heart, had apparently said she didn't mind being the unrequited love's B-list understudy, his second-string substitute.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On that interesting and totally healthy premise, they'd decided to try dating secretly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Leo was proud of a seriously powerful family. He wasn't the type to just let people walk all over him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, anyone who could bully him, make him swallow his anger, and shut up had to be a big deal, not some nobody.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for Freya, who was so desperate to impress Leo, she'd forgotten that crucial detail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she finally realized something was seriously wrong was when she got a clear look at Caroline's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's when she'd jumped to the wildly inaccurate conclusion that Caroline was Leo's long-lost, cherished, unrequited love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's my cousin! My cousin, you idiot!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Freya was, once again, utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The full, horrifying weight of her colossal screw-up finally hit her. She realized just how foolish she'd been.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And trying to suck up to Caroline now?</span><br><span>Way too late for that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, wild guess. Who do you think really set Freya up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late when they got back from the station. Trying to get to bed earlier, they'd showered together. However, their time-saving strategy had gone spectacularly, if pleasantly, off the rails.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, in the deep quiet of the night, heartbeats settled. Alistair lay in bed, propped on an elbow, face to face with Caroline, chatting softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair ventured. "Leo?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline raised an eyebrow. "Why him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you called him a total deadbeat, right? Figured he got tired of her, decided he was done. So he dug a pit for her, made sure she'd piss you off, convenient excuse to dump her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, some logic there... Ah, forget it, honey. I'm being unfair. You don't know my crazy family. You'd never guess."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline cut to the chase. "It was probably Leo's mother pulling the strings."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Leo's mother... Wait, that's Caroline's aunt, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair noticed Caroline didn't even say aunt. She used the formal, detached Leo's mother. That small detail spoke volumes about their ice-cold, estranged relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, it clicked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Of course! Leo's a huge star. His mom probably looks down on Freya and thinks she's not good enough for her precious son. But she doesn't want to be the bad guy, openly breaking them up. Perfect opportunity! Subtly nudge Freya into going after us, knowing it would backfire. Killing two birds with one stone! Diabolical.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline gently placed her hand on Alistair's cheek. "Honey, I won't let you get dragged into that. I won't let you meet people who'll just poison your mood."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her close until no space remained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever messy history Caroline had with her relatives, excluding Mabel, with Mabel still in the picture, Caroline couldn't truly sever all ties.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd meet eventually. It was inevitable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And from Leo's attitude, though he wasn't as likable as Julian, he did seem to care about Caroline, somewhat, in his own twisted way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, as Caroline's husband, couldn't just stay on the sidelines.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, babe. Don't worry. I'm not made of glass. Besides, honey, I'm your husband. You can't selfishly cut me out of parts of your life. Not fair to me. We're a team, remember?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline was silent for a long moment. "They're not as easy to deal with as you think."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's okay. If that's how they are, I don't plan on being easy with them either."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Alistair... They're not like Liam, or Celeste, or Caleb. And definitely not in the same league as scumbags like Nathaniel and Rebecca."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair got it. She was warning him. Her relatives weren't ordinary troublemakers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any one of them was a symbol of serious, top-tier power.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could crush a guy like him as easily as squashing a bothersome ant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that, paradoxically, was why Alistair saw no point in hiding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If they want to see me, can I really avoid it? Not a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trusted Caroline's ability to protect him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't want to cower behind Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to stand in front of Caroline and Eloise and be their shield.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he could say, with genuine, heartfelt confidence, that now, finally, he had the ability to do just that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They held each other silently. Maybe it was the day's craziness or their own thoughts, but neither could sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the darkness, Caroline whispered, "Alistair, you know, actually, just like you, I'm a kid without a mom too."</span></p></div>
