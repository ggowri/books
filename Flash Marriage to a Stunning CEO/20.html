        <h1>Chapter 20 The Temptation of Home</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite having Alistair looking after Eloise, Caroline still felt an urgent pull toward home. She finished her work as quickly as possible and rushed back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Beyond seeing her precious Eloise, coming home now carried an additional temptation for her&mdash;Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline couldn't figure out the reason, no matter how much she pondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was watching a cartoon with Eloise&mdash;a well-received animated film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even kindergarteners had homework, though the amount was so minimal it could be practically ignored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair and Eloise sat together on the sofa, barefoot, his large feet contrasting with her tiny ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise cuddled against him dependently while Alistair casually draped his arm over her shoulders. Their eyes remained fixed on the television screen, wholly absorbed in what they were watching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The scene was so heartwarming that Caroline unconsciously paused in her tracks, afraid her presence might disturb their peaceful moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she watched, Alistair seemed to sense something and turned his head toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise noticed Caroline and said, "Mommy!" in her sweet, clear voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline approached them. "Did I startle you?" she asked, directing the question at Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair gave her a confused look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's expression remained serious, showing no signs of teasing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Perhaps my gaze had lingered on her a second too long?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was quietly annoyed with himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He hoped Caroline wouldn't think he was the type who couldn't tear his eyes away from a beautiful woman. And he certainly didn't want her to see him as some delicate flower who turned pale at the slightest disturbance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair instinctively wanted to protect his image before her, despite not usually caring what others thought of him. "Sorry, I didn't notice when you came in. I was just caught off guard," he explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline glanced at him, then couldn't help but look again a few seconds later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At first, Alistair found her behavior puzzling, but he quickly remembered what he'd done that afternoon...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sure enough, Caroline said, "You look much healthier now, not like before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had looked malnourished, she thought, but didn't say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair definitely couldn't tell her the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't share his exceptional ability with anyone, not even those closest to him. They'd think he was insane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I guess I've been resting well these past couple of days," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline accepted his explanation without question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They decided to get pizza that evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was a new place that had just opened, and everyone who'd been there said it was pretty good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The restaurant was in a downtown plaza, so they wouldn't need to drive. After dinner, they could exercise while walking home leisurely and killing two birds with one stone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise bounced down the stairs with her cartoon bear purse slung over her shoulder, holding Alistair's hand in one and Caroline's in the other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The weather had warmed noticeably after the spring rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The breeze carried a pleasant freshness and a subtle fragrance from Caroline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even their legal status as husband and wife couldn't change the fact that they barely knew each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If not for Eloise, the marriage license that had forcibly brought them together would have left them feeling awkward during their time alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The pizza place was doing great business for its grand opening. Fortunately, they had arrived early; otherwise, there wouldn't have been any seats left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Vivienne has quite the clever mind," someone remarked. "Her restaurant is thriving. Among all the girls who grew up together, I'd say she's the most promising."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Whitfield, don't be so modest. You simply didn't want your daughter to struggle. Otherwise, Rebecca could have built an impressive business of her own as well. Mr. Whitfield, did you spot someone you know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel, who had already reserved a lovely table at the pizza place, walked in, surrounded by his entourage. His attention was suddenly drawn to a young man's back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He shifted his gaze away and smiled. "I was mistaken," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca was having dinner with Cordelia when Nathaniel walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Weren't you supposed to be supporting Vivienne's restaurant today?" Cordelia asked him. "Why are you back so early?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Got an urgent call and came back for some documents," Nathaniel replied. Then, spotting Rebecca, he blurted out, "What are you doing here? Who's having pizza with Alistair then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca was particularly sensitive to the name "Alistair" now. "Dad, you saw Alistair?" she asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel nodded. "Yes, at the pizza place. If he wasn't with you, who else would he be with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?" Cordelia questioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel shook his head firmly. "My eyesight isn't that bad. How could I mistake Rebecca's husband?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cordelia gave Rebecca a complicated look. "Rebecca, what's going on here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Rebecca had arrived alone earlier, she'd claimed that Daniel was demanding to go to the arcade, and Alistair had taken him there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cordelia had even criticized her then, saying she shouldn't spoil the child so much or he'd grow up thinking he could do whatever he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking about how she'd gone to Rebecca's house earlier to deliver caviar only to find it looking like it had been ransacked, combined with Rebecca's unusual behavior, Cordelia's expression turned serious. "Rebecca, what's really happening? Tell me the truth. Has Alistair done something to hurt you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Vivienne was swamped with work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With too many customers and insufficient staff, she had jumped in herself to help despite being the owner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the middle of the rush, she suddenly stopped in her tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had just glimpsed someone familiar!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Uncertain, she looked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Vivienne's eyes widened in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It really was Alistair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet on second glance, she couldn't help but wonder&mdash;was it truly Alistair?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He seemed different!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked vibrant and energetic, in much better shape than someone who had been through such hardship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Vivienne hesitated, about to take a third look, her phone vibrated in her pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Outside the restaurant, Rebecca got straight to the point, furiously. "Where's Alistair? Tell him to come out and face me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Vivienne could only sigh internally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She no longer bothered reminding this self-centered princess that Alistair wasn't her errand boy anymore, jumping at her every command.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instead, she tried to reason politely, "Rebecca, I'm extremely busy right now. Can we talk about this later, please?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca let out a contemptuous laugh. "If I'd known you were this fond of him, I would have handed him over to you ages ago. You'd probably be sick of him by now, instead of being so clingy you won't even let me see him. What, are you afraid I'll steal him back? Don't forget, he's the man I dumped."</p></div>
