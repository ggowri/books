        <h1>Chapter 1 Kicked Out</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Rick's coming over tonight. He won't be happy to see you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair Harlow had spent the entire afternoon slaving away in the kitchen. Just as he walked out with the last dish in hand, his wife, Rebecca Whitfield, dropped that cold sentence on him like a lead weight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man she mentioned, was Richard Morgan, the one she'd always loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair froze for a moment, then untied his apron with a quiet nod. "Alright, I'll head out. I'll wait for your call to come back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's gaze hardened. "Don't bother coming back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before he could process her words, she flung a piece of paper at him. "We're getting divorced tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair bent down, picking up the note. His eyes scanned it quickly, confirming its contents, and a tremor ran through him. He clutched the paper tightly as if it weren't just a scrap of stationery but something more vital than life itself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He forced down the storm inside him and turned to leave. But just as he reached the door, a thought struck him. "Danny..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alistair!" Rebecca's voice was sharp, her face darkening. "Don't you dare act like you're anything to him! Just because Danny's called you 'Dad' for five years doesn't make you his father. I'm warning you, don't bring him up. Get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In fact, all Alistair had wanted was to remind her that her son, Daniel Whitfield, seemed to be coming down with something, and she should keep an eye on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He and Rebecca had married because of her pregnancy. After the wedding, he'd moved into her family's home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They had a five-year-old son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To the outside world, they were the picture of a happy family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But behind closed doors, there was a truth that almost no one knew. Not even Rebecca's parents. Their marriage had been nothing more than a childish act of defiance, a petty rebellion Rebecca staged against Richard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair and Rebecca had known each other since high school. She was the school's golden girl. She'd been beautiful, wealthy, the center of attention wherever she went.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair, on the other hand, was a nobody, a studious kid from a struggling family, pouring every ounce of his energy into his studies, hoping a top college would be his ticket to a better life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was the dazzling heiress, and he was the quiet nerd in the corner. Their paths should never have crossed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But one day, Rebecca, disheveled and desperate, sought him out. She tossed a bank card at him and made a blunt offer. She wanted him to be the father to the child she was carrying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her condition was simple. He had to give up his SATs and commit to her immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair barely hesitated before agreeing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In fact, Rebecca had no shortage of admirers, but Alistair wasn't one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said yes for one reason&mdash;he needed the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Life can be merciless sometimes. Reality always forces people into choices they never imagined they'd have to make.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the time, Alistair's family was drowning in crisis. His father had caused a car accident, injuring someone badly, and the victim's family demanded a hefty settlement. Without the money, his father faced a decade in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca brought Alistair home and announced to her parents that he was the father of her unborn child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her parents were livid. Her father, Nathaniel Whitfield, nearly lost his mind. He unleashed his fury, whipping Alistair's back until it was raw. Her mother, Cordelia Whitfield, wept in heartbreak and rage. But Rebecca refused to terminate the pregnancy, leaving her parents no choice but to grudgingly accept Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With the two million dollars Rebecca gave him, Alistair saved his father from ruin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd always known the child's real father was Richard, the man Rebecca loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair knew he was just a pawn in her game of revenge, but it didn't bother him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their marriage was never about love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a transaction, cold and calculated from the start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For years, Alistair lived cut off from the world. His life revolved entirely around Rebecca and Daniel. He played the role of dutiful househusband, cooking, cleaning, and keeping things running smoothly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He went out of his way to win over Rebecca's parents, caring for them on her behalf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn't the life he'd dreamed of, but he had no other options. Rebecca held his IOU, a chain that kept him tethered. Without her consent, he couldn't walk away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd waited years for this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, after an exhausting afternoon in the kitchen, without so much as a sip of water, Alistair was thrown out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca didn't even give him time to pack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Dressed in worn house clothes, a pair of slippers on his feet, and an old flip phone in his pocket that could barely do more than make calls, he left the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The first thing he did was tear up the IOU.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In that instant, he felt the weight of a mountain that had crushed him for six long years finally lift. Alistair felt lighter, freer as if he'd been given a second chance at life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Penniless and adrift, the world stretched out endlessly before you, yet it felt like there was no place for you in it. Two paths lay before you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Option one: You could crawl back to Rebecca, plead for mercy, and hope she'd take pity on you for the six years you'd toiled as her dutiful househusband. If she's feeling particularly generous, maybe she'll toss you a loan or a menial job to scrape by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Option two: You could cut ties with Rebecca and everyone connected to her for good. No more living without dignity, no more being at the mercy of others. The struggles you face now are temporary, and you could rise from the ashes and start anew."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A voice echoed in his mind, clear and commanding, startling him.</p></div>
