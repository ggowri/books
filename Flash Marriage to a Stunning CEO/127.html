        <h1>Chapter 127 A Little Brother or Sister</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was stuck between a rock and a hard place, unable to defend himself. After all, they were the ones who tried to set Alistair up first. He couldn't throw Alistair under the bus without d</span><span>ragging Brady and the screenwriter into the mess too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady had already warned them. If he or that female colleague couldn't keep their mouths shut, they'd be kicked out of New York for good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now Caleb had gone viral online again, for all the wrong rea</span><span>sons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Celeste heard her once-prideful son had become a laughingstock, she literally fainted on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, why are you showering so early today?" Eloise asked, her big, curious eyes fixed on Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave her a deadpan look. "I </span><span>accidentally stepped in dog poop while I was out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Eloise's eyes grew even wider. "Dog poop?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yep," Alistair said with a completely straight face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What else could you call Caleb and that young woman but dog poop? And then there was Brady. That old</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> fox managed to walk away completely unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, that woman never even got close to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though whatever perfume she'd been wearing had given Alistair a splitting headache. His clothes probably still reeked of that awful smell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>lifted his sleeve and took a sniff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down, he found Eloise leaning in close. She sniffed the air around him very carefully for a moment before announcing in her sweet little voice, "Don't worry, Daddy. You don't smell like poop."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair couldn't h</span><span>elp but laugh at her innocent concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you should probably take a shower anyway," Eloise continued. "I can't smell anything, but Mommy might. If she finds out you accidentally stepped in poop today, she'll feel really bad for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair felt a war</span><span>mth spread through his chest. "So does that mean Eloise feels bad for Daddy too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded solemnly. "That's why you need to be super careful when you walk by yourself. Don't step in poop again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair caught the "by yourself" part of her statement. "</span><span>Why only when I'm by myself?" he asked, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I'm with you, I'll help you see the path clearly," she explained thoughtfully. After a moment, she added, "Daddy, you don't have to watch the ground when you're with me. But when I'm not there, you re</span><span>ally need to pay attention.</span><br><span>"Other people might not think about this. Mommy might help watch the path for you too, but she's usually really busy and sometimes has to answer all kinds of phone calls, so she might not be able to keep track of everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As</span><span> Eloise spoke, she shook her little head with absolute seriousness, making the two little bun-shaped pigtails her preschool teacher had done bounce back and forth. Combined with her earnest expression, she couldn't have been more adorable if she tried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ali</span><span>stair couldn't help but scoop up Eloise and lift her high in the air. "Eloise, thank you for being Daddy's little sweetheart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise burst into giggles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting her back down, Alistair said, "Go read your book, sweetie. I'm going to take a shower."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!</span><span>" Eloise nodded enthusiastically, grabbed her book, and skipped off to the sunroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She absolutely loved the swing they'd set up just for her in there. Whenever she had free time, she'd hop on it, gently swaying back and forth while reading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bathroo</span><span>m, Alistair scrubbed himself twice with soap and followed up with two rounds of shower gel, practically washing his skin raw before finally stepping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After changing into comfortable loungewear, he made his way to the bright sunroom and settled into the</span><span> couch, content to simply be in the same space as his little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise put down her book and pattered over to snuggle up next to him. "Daddy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled, ruffling her hair, "What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise blinked her bright, lively eyes. "A lot of kids in my </span><span>class have brothers and sisters. I want one too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair looked thoughtful. "Did your great-grandma say something to you about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise looked confused, her little mind struggling to follow this sudden change in topic. "Great-Grandma? She tells me l</span><span>ots of things. She said Nugget likes me and I should visit her more often.</span><br><span>"She also promised that next time I come over, she'll have the housekeeper make me something sweet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise rattled off a long list of things on her fingers, but never mentioned M</span><span>abel asking if she wanted a little brother or sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had assumed Mabel was using Eloise to pressure them into having another child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked like he was overthinking things. Kids that young usually wouldn't have such calculated intentions. Besid</span><span>es, Eloise was pretty reliable and never made stuff up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a whim, Alistair brought up the topic with her. "So, would you rather have a little brother or sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Mabel's not-so-subtle hint about having another baby, he and Caroline had </span><span>discussed it, but they'd silently agreed to let the matter drop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell Caroline cared about what he wanted, and he cared about what she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, if either of them had shown even the slightest interest in having a child, they would've </span><span>immediately made it happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Alistair himself, he genuinely didn't have strong feelings about having his own biological children. And Caroline? Well, considering she'd once told Alistair she never planned to get married, it was pretty clear she </span><span>wanted to give all her maternal love to little Eloise alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether Caroline didn't want another child or was worried Eloise might feel left out didn't really matter. Whatever she decided, Alistair would back her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise answered without a seco</span><span>nd thought, "As long as it's from you and Mom, I'd love having a little brother or sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her response caught Alistair completely off guard. This little girl with her honey-sweet words often had him wrapped around her finger without even realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"W</span><span>hat's got everyone so happy in here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had just gotten home from work. Not finding them in the living room, she'd known exactly where they'd be. The sunroom had become everyone's favorite spot in the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walking in on these heartwarming father-d</span><span>aughter chats had become one of her daily energy boosts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise immediately ran to her. "Mom! I was just asking Dad if you guys could please give me a little brother or sister. Can you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline froze for a moment, her eyes finding Alistair's. He just smi</span><span>led and explained, "Eloise was telling me how many of her classmates have siblings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline scooped Eloise up and carried her to the sofa, settling down next to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five-year-olds were surprisingly heavy. As Caroline held Eloise on her lap, she cou</span><span>ldn't help remembering when she'd first brought her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Eloise was just a tiny, skinny thing who barely weighed anything in her arms. Now she'd blossomed into a cheerful, lively little beauty under Caroline's care. The transformation filled he</span><span>r with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She played with Eloise's adorably chubby little hands for a moment before asking, "Aren't you worried that if you get a baby brother or sister, Mom and Dad might be too busy with the baby to spend time with you?"</span></p></div>
