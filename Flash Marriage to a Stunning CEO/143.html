        <h1>Chapter 143 Not Worth a Damn</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Schemer's Bane could make Alistair instantly sniff out anyone nearby with bad intentions and make damn sure they got what was coming to them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair figured, no matter how much of a lowlife Richard was, he'd at least try to keep up appearances in public. Besides, that whole two guys duking it out over a girl mess had just died down. Richard had to tread carefully. No way was he that desperate to start harassing someone right on the street.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, naturally, The Schemer's Bane bit him in the ass.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Serves him right!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But for a creep like Richard, just having his reputation trashed feels way too easy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw Caroline's face go ice-cold.</span><br><span>Okay, looks like my wife is filing this one away...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like watching a bad movie rerun. Alistair saw Rebecca, looking like she'd been dragged through a hedge backward, muscle her way out of the crowd. She was so desperate to escape the fallout that she even ditched her own kid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Of course, I have no clue Rebecca has been planning to bail on her son for ages...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Rebecca hurried past them, something seemed to click, and her head snapped up, eyes locking onto them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She froze just for a second, pure, unadulterated panic flashing across her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline, noticing Rebecca practically drilling holes into her husband with her stare, jerked her chin toward Richard, who was now surrounded. "Stop drooling over someone else's husband. Yours is over there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca looked like she wanted the earth to open up and swallow her. Every last shred of her old arrogance was gone. In front of Caroline, she was completely deflated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt like she'd been slapped in the face, but she didn't dare get lippy with Caroline. "He's not my husband!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might have been saying it to Caroline, but it felt like the words were aimed straight at Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, just like she'd figured, Alistair's expression didn't even flicker.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was bent down, talking to Eloise, completely ignoring her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline twisted the knife, her voice dripping sarcasm. "Oh, so maybe not on paper, but you two were definitely a thing. You even have a kid together. He's your husband, alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's face burned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears pricked at her eyes, threatening to spill.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And the kicker? I can't say a damn thing. Because, let's be honest, I screw up first...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca wished a hole would open up in the ground and swallow her whole.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gasped in a shaky breath and looked at Alistair, and her voice was barely a whisper. "Alistair..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair flicked a cool, dismissive glance her way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca bit her lower lip so hard that it must have hurt. The tears finally broke free, and a tremor ran through her body that she couldn't control.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, just meeting Alistair's gaze took every last ounce of courage she possessed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry I am so, so sorry. I was out of my mind back then I'm not asking you to forgive me. If you want payback, take it out on me. I'll do anything. That whole thing It has nothing to do with my parents, I swear. Please, just leave them out of it..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's voice was flat. "What are you talking about? Sorry, I haven't got a clue."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Right. As long as they don't have any proof, the Whitfield family drama has nothing to do with me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's tears came faster now, a desperate, almost wild look hardening her face. "Then what if I give you my life? Would that be enough?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair almost laughed out loud. "What the hell would I do with your life?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca just stood there, rooted to the spot, an icy chill seeping into her bones, watching Alistair walk further and further away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As far as she was concerned, she had nothing left. Her life was the only thing of any value she had left to offer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I hurt Alistair. So, if I give him my life, wouldn't that make things even? Wouldn't that be enough to pay for the pain I cause?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But his reaction tells me everything I need to know. In his eyes, my life isn't worth a damn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Some things, I just can't put a price on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So what if I actually give him my life? It doesn't change a single goddamn thing that already happens.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, babe. Downstairs at Stellar Films."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was out and about, Alistair's favorite pastime was blowing up Caroline's phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the best part of Caroline's workday? Without a doubt, Alistair's text message blitzes...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd added one rule, though. When Alistair texted, he had to include a picture, a selfie, to be exact.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just wanted to see her husband's face. It was that simple.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they saw each other morning, noon, and night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If There's a Next Second was officially a go. As the screenwriter, Alistair was suddenly slammed. The director wanted him to flesh out some of the script details.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how swamped he was, he always made time to bring Caroline lunch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his book, making sure his wife had a decent lunch was way higher on the priority list than any career move.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves was over the moon with the new script draft. He'd invited Alistair to dinner, casually mentioning that the producer, investors, and the main cast would be at a lunch meeting that day, too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair politely passed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves was genuinely floored.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Alistair was the real deal, a genuine talent. Plus, he owed him big time. After Alistair tipped him off about Brady's shady, under-the-table crap, Yves immediately severed all ties with Brady and his crew. When Brady's scandal finally exploded, Yves, even though he was innocent, would have definitely gotten caught in the shrapnel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd offered to open up his network for Alistair and introduce him around, and Alistair actually turned him down!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, thinking about Alistair's age, Yves couldn't help but crack a smile. He remembered being just as headstrong and convinced of his own brilliance when he was around that age, thinking talent was the only thing that mattered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had only been a decade or so, but he'd changed a lot. The one thing that probably hadn't changed was his rock-solid refusal to sell out his principles for a quick buck...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves genuinely liked Alistair and wanted to help him get ahead. He grinned. "Alistair, Freya's gonna be there too."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was pure tease, like he expected Alistair's eyes to light up at the mere mention of Freya's name.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Alistair just looked blank. "Freya who?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves was speechless for a solid second.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Figuring maybe he hadn't been clear, he tried again. "You know, Freya."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair still looked completely clueless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves' eyes slowly widened in disbelief. "Don't even tell me you have no idea who Freya is."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair shrugged. "Sorry, I don't really follow the whole celebrity scene, and I barely watch TV. Is she, like, a big deal or something?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just some nobody screenwriter. He had zero pull when it came to casting. The actors had only just been finalized, so he hadn't even had a chance to look into it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Yves was a legend in the directing world, a total maverick. Alistair wasn't worried about his baby getting butchered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves stared at Alistair like he was some kind of caveman, but at the same time, he was kind of fascinated. "You don't know Freya Peterson? Man, she blew up before she even officially debuted, with that video of her dancing solo in the rain. She's, like, the ultimate dream girl for a million geeks out there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was talking, he pulled up Freya's photo on his phone for Alistair, still ribbing him. "Seriously, Alistair, where have you been living, under a rock with no internet? How do you not know who this girl is? She's huge!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair just smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My past is my past. No need for the whole world to know every detail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Back when I should be out there sowing my wild oats, I felt like my soul was locked in a cage. By the time I finally get free, the whole flashy, superficial online world doesn't do it for me anymore.</span></p></div>
