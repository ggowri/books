        <h1>Chapter 13 The Strategic Retreat</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard followed his gaze to where a man was ducking into a Maybach. His profile looked somewhat like Alistair's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But how could it possibly be Alistair? He's nothing but a pathetic, miserable loser!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel kept insisting, "I saw Daddy! That was Daddy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's expression darkened. "Danny, how many times do your mother and I have to tell you? I am your father!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dropping Eloise off at preschool, Caroline headed to work while Alistair took a taxi to Everett Villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Everetts had prepared all sorts of ingredients, with several household staff ready to help with the prep work. They handled everything from sorting and washing vegetables to chopping and mincing. Alistair only needed to do the actual cooking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd never received this kind of treatment when he was with Rebecca.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever Alistair joined Rebecca for dinner with her family, he never got to sit at the table and enjoy a leisurely meal with everyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The kitchen was his domain. It was perfectly normal for him to prepare 15 or 20 dishes all by himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time he finished cooking, everyone had nearly finished eating, chatting happily and playing with the kids. He would quietly sit at the edge of the table, picking at whatever leftovers remained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thankfully, that was all in the past now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair prepared the meal with ease, even finding time to chat with Vivienne when she popped into the kitchen to say hello.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne's eyes lit up when she saw how vibrant Alistair looked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was like finding a diamond in the rough&mdash;something that had been there all along, just waiting for someone to polish off the dirt and let it shine again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What a spirited, talented young man.<br>It was completely unrecognizable from the quiet, withdrawn Alistair she remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a split second, the years melted away, and Vivienne could see clearly the spirited young man he'd been in high school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, even though Alistair was poor, his eyes had sparkled with dreams of the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he dropped out of school to become the father of Rebecca's child, that light in his eyes disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was such a mess.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that faint, long-absent sparkle return to Alistair's eyes filled Vivienne with genuine happiness for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you so much. My mother had a wonderful time today," she said, reaching for her phone. "Let me send your payment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair shook his head. "That's not necessary. I'm glad your mother likes it. I don't need payment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne could tell he wasn't just being polite, which made her anxious. "That won't work! I can't let you do all this for nothing. Is the amount too low? We could&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not that," he interrupted. "I've actually been wanting to thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne understood what he meant and felt a twinge of regret. "I haven't done anything special. At least let me buy you a dinner next time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair just smiled politely without saying a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne knew exactly what was happening. It was what she'd expected, and she didn't feel rejected or embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, she was attracted to Alistair, but unlike some of the rich girls in her social circle, she wasn't looking for casual thrills or a quick fling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was too rational to entertain impossible fantasies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair had nothing against Vivienne personally. In fact, he was grateful to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite coming from money, Vivienne was gentle and good-natured without a trace of entitlement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought highly of her, but that was where it ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She belonged to Rebecca's social circle, and he preferred to keep his distance from that world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne smoothly changed the subject. "You'll laugh, but ever since my mom tried the chicken noodle soup Rebecca brought over, she hasn't stopped talking about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Midway through, she noticed that while Alistair's expression remained neutral, his eyes had grown distant. She stopped herself, realizing she'd accidentally mentioned Rebecca.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne sighed inwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She and Rebecca had grown up together, so she knew Rebecca's temperament all too well&mdash;spoiled, willful, and determined to do things her own way. Only around Richard did Rebecca ever show her softer side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She figured Alistair must have suffered quite a bit working for Rebecca, leaving him with some emotional scars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Alistair had refused any payment, Vivienne had prepared a gift for him. Worried he might feel uncomfortable accepting it, she was relieved when he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair politely declined her invitation to stay for dinner, claiming he had other commitments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he left, Vivienne walked him to the door herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Vivienne's phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glanced oddly at Alistair when she saw who was calling. "Hello, Rebecca?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the mention of Rebecca's name, Alistair's face went blank as he walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go for a spa day? I'm sorry, Rebecca, but I can't make it. I've got things to do today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's ridiculous." Vivienne rolled her eyes at whatever Rebecca said next. "I seriously can't get away. Don't start with that nonsense, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time she hung up, Alistair had already walked out the front door. He gave her a quick wave without looking back before disappearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne stopped in her tracks, Rebecca's words still echoing in her mind. She couldn't help but shake her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She'd got this feeling that Rebecca was going to regret this big time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever. Not my problem.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne watched Alistair vanish around the corner, then headed back inside. </p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair strolled calmly under the warm spring sunshine, pulling out his phone to make a call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caroline had texted him two minutes earlier about a designer coming to take measurements for his spring wardrobe, asking when he'd be back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The call connected, and Alistair spoke up, "I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss me already? We just said goodbye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair looked up into a pair of eyes gleaming with mockery. He knew those eyes all too well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A Mercedes was parked beside a willow tree sprouting fresh buds. Rebecca sat in the driver's seat with the window halfway down, her expression unreadable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair looked away without reacting and kept walking. "I'm heading back now&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alistair!" Rebecca suddenly raised her voice, cutting him off again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair frowned. Her tone was equally familiar to him. It meant a storm was brewing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But things were different now. Their divorce was final, their arrangement over. They had nothing to do with each other anymore, and he had zero interest in dealing with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caroline's voice came through the phone. "Are you having trouble? Send me your location and I'll have someone check on you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had heard Rebecca's shout through the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair was about to say everything was fine when he heard a loud slam behind him. Rebecca had gotten out of her car and was actually chasing after him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair was beyond frustrated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd long suspected there was something wrong with this woman.<br>She's completely lost it. When is she going to see a doctor about that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's fine. I can handle this," he said calmly.</p></div>
