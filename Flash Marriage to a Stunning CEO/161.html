        <h1>Chapter 161 Cooperation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Alistair discovered the conflict between Giselle and Caroline, he lost all interest in working with Stellar Films.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he found himself at a crossroads, someone offered his support, despite the potential backlash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair understood that cutting ties with him was merely the opening move in this calculated attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than panic, he waited calmly for the next shoe to drop, ready to handle whatever came his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His composure was simple to explain&mdash;he'd already figured out the mastermind's game plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was Caroline's aunt, yet for some reason, she couldn't stand to see her niece succeed. Alistair suspected she simply looked down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew exactly what Paige planned to gain from this chaos and who she intended to partner with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an almost omniscient perspective, Alistair watched these schemers try to corner him, all while steadily pushing his career forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the originally cast actors, only Aaron's sister remained committed to the project. The rest predictably followed the money and distanced themselves from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make matters worse, the actor originally cast as the lead in If There's a Next Second publicly trashed the project during an interview for his new film. He denounced the screenwriter's character, earning praise from fans for his "integrity" and "moral compass."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, word spread that If There's a Next Second was still in production, now backed by a newcomer called Feather Films.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Stellar Films' abandonment, the team was scrambling to find fresh talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense. Established actors guarded their reputations carefully. Few would risk their energy on a film that might never see the light of day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The director remained the acclaimed Yves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone thought he'd lost his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A talented director needed major studio backing and dedicated performers to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the industry, Yves' decision reeked of hubris, and many eagerly anticipated his inevitable downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During their meeting, Alistair had mentioned he'd personally finance If There's a Next Second and invited Yves to direct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves was stunned but promised to consider it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stellar Films had also offered Yves their new project. With two films on the table, he had to choose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had made the offer casually, not expecting much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Yves got along well, but any rational person would choose the security of Stellar Films over a risky venture with a new company teetering on the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a simple career decision for Yves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Choosing Alistair meant burning bridges with Stellar Films&mdash;a potentially career-ending move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Yves deliberated, Stellar Films' and the production company's tactics turned his stomach. They made sure he understood exactly who he'd be crossing if he refused to play ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves refused to sell his soul or back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compromise would turn him into another soulless cash cow for investors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Retreat would leave him nowhere to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a sleepless night, fully aware that Alistair still faced accusations of "moral bankruptcy" and "allegedly orchestrating his ex-wife's parents' deaths," Yves decided to roll the dice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they met again, Alistair grinned. "Yves, you're betting your entire future on me. A lot of pressure for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her relaxed smile showed no hint of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you worried at all?" Yves asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fallout from your ex-wife's parents' accident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't done anything wrong," Alistair replied. "What's there to fear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves thought him naive. Being older and supposedly wiser, he tended to see things through a more cynical lens. "Alistair, the world isn't always about right and wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get it," Alistair said. "You think someone's using this accident to destroy me? If that's true, why risk working with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves laughed, "Because I'm a gambler at heart. Everyone says I'm insane, but something tells me you're a winning bet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair extended his hand gratefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides Caroline, Yves was the only other person to trust him purely on instinct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their handshake sealed not just a business deal, but a lasting friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yves," Alistair said solemnly, "I promise you'll come out on top."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words had barely left his mouth when someone charged at Alistair, startling them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bodyguard disguised as a casual pedestrian nearly intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's eyes were fixed on Alistair. "Did you plan my parents' accident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A week had passed since the crash. Her mother was dead, and while her father had stabilized, he remained unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctors said the brain damage was severe&mdash;he might never wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves, recognizing her, glanced instinctively at Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair met Rebecca's gaze calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never intended to let the Whitfields off the hook. But he hadn't planned to dirty his own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wouldn't taint the happiness he'd found with bloodshed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since someone else had done the deed, he'd simply reap the benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when certain parties tried to drag him down, he remained composed, watching their machinations with detached interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have proof, go to the police," Alistair said coldly. "Otherwise, I'll sue you for slander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca cried, "I'm the one who wronged you! I said I'd face the consequences. If you want revenge, take it out on me. Why hurt my parents? They were innocent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves murmured to Alistair, "Someone's taking photos."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Rebecca was being manipulated by someone with an agenda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the internet would explode with condemnation of Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair merely smiled, "Don't worry, Yves. Since they're offering free publicity, we might as well use it."</span></p></div>
