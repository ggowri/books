        <h1>Chapter 103 Secure</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline hadn't called back the person who had been keeping an eye on Liam. However, there had been no updates relayed to Alistair in the past couple of days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weather had been relentlessly damp, with rain falling on and off, the sky stubbornly overcast, refusing to clear up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, it was pouring again, the rhythmic patter of raindrops heralding the vibrant renewal of spring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel had sent Eloise some flower seeds, and the little girl was thrilled, eagerly planting them in pots with Alistair's help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The balcony was already a mini garden, filled with various plants that they planned to take with them when they moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Alistair had grown attached to their current home, the thought of their new place&mdash;just a few minutes' walk from Eloise's new kindergarten&mdash;eased his reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise could sleep a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, anywhere could feel like home as long as he had his wife and daughter by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alistair helped Eloise plant the seeds, he glanced out the window at the camphor trees swaying wildly in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The temperature had dropped with the rain, and he couldn't help but worry about Caroline. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had just recovered from an illness, and he hoped she was staying warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logically, he knew she spent most of her time indoors, barely exposed to the elements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his heart refused to listen&mdash;this was just how family cared for each other, wasn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the seeds were planted, Eloise clasped her tiny hands together, her voice earnest and hopeful. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seeds, seeds, please grow strong and bloom quickly. I promise I'll take good care of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She even added with a solemn nod, "I swear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair bit back a smile, feeling his heart warm. His little angel never failed to brighten his day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't imagine what his life would have been like without Caroline and Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six years ago, the truth might have driven him to reckless anger, unanchored and unhinged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But their love had given him something to hold onto, a reason to stay calm and grounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After planting, Alistair took Eloise to wash her muddy hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He rinsed them under the tap, then helped her lather up with soap. Eloise rubbed her chubby little hands together, producing a froth of bubbles, and asked, "Daddy, is this enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair nodded. "That's perfect. Just rinse it off now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise obediently held her hands under the running water, then dried them with a towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sniffed her hands proudly and held them up to Alistair. "Daddy, smell! Aren't they so nice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, the cook approached Alistair. "Mr. Harlow, I'll be heading out now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair looked up, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Dinner's ready already?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Usually, she stayed until after they'd eaten and everything was cleaned up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cook smiled, sensing his confusion, "Didn't Ms. Ashbourne tell you? You won't be dining in tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair checked his phone and saw a message from Caroline sent ten minutes ago. He'd been too engrossed in helping Eloise to notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly replied with a simple "Got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Scrolling up, he saw his earlier reminder for her to take her medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her response, a voice message, played in his mind. "Got it, hubby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd replayed it countless times, grinning like a fool, then scolding himself for getting carried away. But the joy fueled him, and he channeled it into his response, typing away with renewed energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By six in the evening, Caroline returned home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mommy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise always made sure to position her little pink stool about six feet from the front door, ready to greet Caroline the moment she walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mommy, you must be tired today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline scooped her up, planting a kiss on her soft cheek. "Were you a good girl today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! Daddy and I planted flowers!" Eloise announced proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's wonderful!" Caroline said, her gaze drifting toward the living room, where she met Alistair's warm, smiling eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The unspoken affection between them was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stepped forward, wrapping her in a hug. "You've had a long day, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't care about the so-called hardships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Caroline, no matter how much sweat and sacrifice she had put in the real world, it was all worth it the moment she stepped through the door and was greeted by her sweet-natured daughter and thoughtful husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline hugged him back. "You've had a long day too, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for her sincere tone, he might've thought she was teasing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, his daily routine consisted of dropping Eloise off at kindergarten and being chauffeured around in a luxury car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't cook, clean, or lift a finger around the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What exactly was he tired from?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline remarked on his long day, yet he lacked the gumption to brush it off as nothing. A nagging sense of guilt gnawed at him, leaving him tongue-tied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it still raining outside?" he asked, taking her coat and hanging it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline said, "A little. It's chilly out&mdash;perfect pizza weather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That place we went to last time was nice. Great atmosphere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair knew she meant Vivienne's pizzeria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't mind supporting her business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure," he agreed, though he felt the need to explain. "That place is actually..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hesitated, unsure how to describe Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's run by Rebecca's best friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline paused mid-step, glancing up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it bothers you, we can go somewhere else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair chuckled and said, "I don't mind. I just didn't want you to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only in hindsight that he discovered the pizza joint was Vivienne's business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline, with her razor-sharp intellect, immediately picked up on his unease. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're fretting that I'll mind once I learn about this later, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair hastened to clarify, "I'm not insinuating you're being small-minded. I just figured it'd be better to lay all the cards on the table."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline fixed him with a steady gaze for a brief moment. Alistair was left adrift, trying to decipher the thoughts racing through her mind in those fleeting seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a radiant smile lit up her face, and she said, "Thanks, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair wasn't sure what she was thanking him for.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">My honesty, perhaps?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he knew one thing&mdash;sincerity always worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair wasn't playing any mind games. Whenever an idea popped into his head about sharing something with Caroline, he'd just let it fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline smiled, "Thank you for making me feel so secure." She slipped off her shoes and headed to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise, ever curious, tugged at Alistair's sleeve. "Daddy, what's 'secure'?"</span></p></div>
