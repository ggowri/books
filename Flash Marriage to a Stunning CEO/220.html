        <h1>Chapter 220 The Leverage</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's motive for keeping the wooden box was clear&mdash;leverage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And judging by the way things were unfolding, that leverage had worked. Lorraine, sly and cold-blooded, clearly thought she had Caroline wrapped around her finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single phone </span><span>call, and the ever-precious Caroline had come alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine lounged comfortably, her tone calm and commanding as she said, "Call the director of the psychiatric facility. Tell him it's from your father. Tell him Professor Paige Ashbourne is to be release</span><span>d immediately. Then write us a check for one hundred million."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Caroline stayed silent, she smiled. "Of course, you can say no. But if you do, I'm afraid you'll never see what your mother left you ever again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She flicked open a lighter. The flame danc</span><span>ed and then died with a click.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't subtle. If Caroline didn't obey, she'd burn the keepsake her mother had left behind without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was blatant, brutal blackmail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Lorraine was certain Caroline would fold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that she came alone al</span><span>ready said everything about how much that box meant to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline glanced at her watch under the dim yellow glow of a streetlamp. It was already 7:30. She needed to be home by ten at the latest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave Lorraine a cold, expressionless look. During that</span><span> one terrible year, Lorraine&mdash;one of Paige's loyal dogs&mdash;had delighted in tearing her down with insults, </span><span>breaking her piece by piece until Caroline had once believed she didn't deserve to exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was something in Caroline's eyes now that made Lorraine u</span><span>neasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was calm, sharp, and impossibly deep&mdash;like staring into still water with something dangerous lurking beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to believe this was the same girl she had once disciplined&mdash;a puppet with hollow eyes, lifeless and silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine remembere</span><span>d how, a year into that "training", Paige herself had come to inspect the results. The girl had passed. But the moment she returned home, she flipped. All of their efforts had gone to waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine had carried that shame for years, wishing for one more c</span><span>hance to "correct" her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could someone like Caroline ever fall back into her hands again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That skinny little girl was now the head of a powerful empire&mdash;far beyond their reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, seeing her again after all these years had made Lorraine f</span><span>eel something twisted, almost like excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To have Caroline trapped in their game? That was a kind of power high no drug could match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Controlling the life of a pampered heiress... it gave her a rush no other job ever had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, under that freezing s</span><span>tare, the autumn wind felt colder than it should have. It bit into her skin, sharp as glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline reached into her bag and pulled out her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine exhaled quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years ago, Paige had given her that wooden box, saying it was the key to </span><span>taming Caroline. With that in their hands, they could make her do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone was already waiting at the psychiatric facility. The moment Paige walked out, they'd put her on a private jet and fly her overseas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline was quiet for a while, fingers </span><span>moving across her screen. Then she said, almost casually, "Your grandson's cute. A little chubby, though. He'd be healthier if he lost a few pounds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine blinked, not following.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Caroline's phone let out a wailing cry. "Nana! Nana, help! The</span><span>y said they're gonna slice me up like a roast. I don't wanna die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine's entire demeanor cracked. She lunged forward, hands scrambling for the phone. But Caroline, as if she couldn't bear to let Lorraine's fingers touch her, tossed the phone to the si</span><span>de with a flick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panicked, Lorraine dropped to the ground and grabbed it. The screen lit up, and tears instantly flooded her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There he was&mdash;her grandson&mdash;tied up like a helpless little pig, writhing and squealing. His voice cracked with fear as he screa</span><span>med, "Nana, help me! I don't wanna die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine's face contorted with rage. "If you hurt him, I swear to God I'll make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline calmly raised her wrist, glancing at the slender bracelet beneath the streetlamp's glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small piece of sea </span><span>glass hung from it, pale green and polished smooth. It had no brand, no embellishment&mdash;nothing that would catch the eye. It looked like some old trinket thrown on without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she'd worn it every day. She never once took it off. Not to slee</span><span>p. Not even in the shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't about the bracelet itself. She knew where it came from. Alistair had found that piece of sea glass when he was a child, walking the beach with his grandfather. He'd kept it all these years, and when the time was right, </span><span>he'd polished it by hand, strung it on a thin silver chain, and given it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't say much. Just handed it to her like it was nothing. She never asked. Most people assumed it was just some cheap accessory. She never corrected them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew wh</span><span>at it meant. It wasn't just jewelry. It was a piece of his past&mdash;a memory&mdash;entrusted to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't release my grandson right now," Lorraine snarled, "I'll burn that box to ash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline absentmindedly played with the bracelet, completely unmoved. "Y</span><span>ou tell me," she said coolly. "What matters more? My mother's keepsake... or your grandson's life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic swept across Lorraine's face.</span><br><span>Like that's even a question.</span><br><span>Of course her grandson mattered more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can talk this through," she said quickly. "The bo</span><span>x is inside. I'll get it for you. Right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She unlocked the gate and gestured toward the house with exaggerated respect. "Ms. Ashbourne, please. Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her eyes flickered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her men were already in position, hidden throughout the yard and ready for</span><span> anything. The moment Caroline stepped through that door, they'd take her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Let's see you act so high and mighty then, you arrogant little brat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine was fuming and terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When had Caroline started watching her family? And how had she missed it</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face twisted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things hadn't gone exactly to plan, but they were still in control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Paige was free, they'd all leave the country. There'd be no consequences. She and the others would follow Paige overseas. Her grandson would get a </span><span>brand-new life in a foreign land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Caroline? She was strong. But she wasn't invincible. She came here alone. If she thought she could leave the same way, she was in for a rude awakening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline stepped forward and entered the yard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine's heart so</span><span>ared.</span><br><span>Got you, you smug little bitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She followed right behind and slammed the gate shut, locking it with a loud clack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the shadows, two dark figures emerged, inching closer along the garden wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine stayed where she was, eyes fixed on </span><span>Caroline's back as she continued walking, seemingly unaware.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two figures crept closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine could already picture the moment they brought Caroline to her knees. The victory was only seconds away. She smiled.</span></p></div>
