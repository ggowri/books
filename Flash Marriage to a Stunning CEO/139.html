        <h1>Chapter 139 He Wanted Danny</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca had left home, but she had no idea where to go. She wandered the streets like a ghost, dazed and aimless. By the time she came to her senses, she was standing outside Vivienne's pizza shop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had parents. She had a child. She even owned multiple properties. And yet, the only person she wanted to see, the only one she felt drawn to, was Vivienne, the very friend she had once cut off herself. It was as if fate had chosen today, of all days, to play a cruel joke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Vivienne was still flustered from wiping Rebecca's tears, her assistant stepped in and informed her someone else had arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Vivienne could respond, the door was shoved open. "I swear, Vivienne, whatever beef we had in the past, let's put that aside for now. I've got something important to&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman who barged in choked on her words the moment she saw Rebecca. She actually staggered, like the sight of her had knocked the air out of her lungs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne pressed a hand to her forehead. This day was unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the entire world had suddenly remembered she existed and was lining up to knock on her door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne took off her sunglasses and stared, stunned by the ghost of the woman in front of her. Then, without waiting for an invitation, she found herself a seat, crossed her legs, and sneered, "Spare me the act. Playing the victim in front of Vivienne? Please. You brought this on yourself. You didn't just destroy your own life. You ruined your entire family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Former best friends, now enemies.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anne, could you not?" Vivienne said, clearly exasperated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For God's sake, if you're gonna fight, do it outside. Or at least somewhere that isn't here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone just had to show up and throw a scene under her roof, didn't they?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne was genuinely worried they were going to start brawling in her office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca wiped her tears and shot back, "You're not wrong. I ruined everything. But I've never wronged you. Anne, have you forgotten? When you were swooning over Caleb, I warned you. I told you to open your eyes. I told you not to lose yourself in love. And what did you do? You turned on me&mdash;for him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne was momentarily stunned. Then she snapped, "You have the nerve to call me love-blind? Have you forgotten how obsessed you were with Richard? And now you're hung up on Alistair? Don't even bother. He hates you. You destroyed his life. You think he's going to take you back? Get real."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne, who had been watching quietly, was suddenly caught off guard. Anne, ever generous with drama, had just let slip something new, something Vivienne hadn't known.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and everyone else had always believed that Rebecca gave Alistair's family two million out of sympathy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it sounded like it had been Rebecca's idea from the beginning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne stared at her in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the most critical turning point of Alistair's life&mdash;when he was on the verge of success&mdash;she had pulled the rug out from under him. If he'd been a mediocre student, maybe it wouldn't have mattered. But he had been top of his class. Everyone had known it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She didn't just hurt him. She derailed him. If luck hadn't been on his side later... she might've destroyed him entirely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca couldn't bear the weight of the room any longer. She stood and whispered, "Sorry for disturbing you," before walking straight out the door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne sat frozen in disbelief. Anne crossed her arms, watching Rebecca disappear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, Anne muttered, "She's in really bad shape. You don't think she'll do anything stupid, do you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne said nothing. She just shook her head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne grabbed her bag and stood up, muttering, "I swear, this is the last time I'm dealing with her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stormed out of Vivienne's office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she passed through the main dining area, she suddenly heard a soft, clear voice say, "Mommy, did you see that lady? She's Ms. Grandma."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ms. Grandma? What the hell?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne stopped in her tracks and turned to look. Near the restroom stood a little girl in a blue dress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne froze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the same kid who'd yelled "grandma!" at her on the street the other day. Alistair had egged her on, too. Anne had never let it go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to scold the girl for saying "grandma" again when she caught sight of the woman standing beside her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes met.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's expression was amused, but her gaze carried a chill that made Anne's stomach drop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Forget it. Why am I getting worked up over a kid?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Anne turned and bolted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline blinked, touched her cheek, and wondered, "Do I look hideous or what?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did that woman run like she'd seen a ghost?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took Eloise's hand and led her back to their table.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pizza had just arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline sat across from Alistair, propped her chin on her hand, and smiled. "I just saw Ms. Grandma."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, in the middle of setting a slice on her plate, looked confused. "What?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise leaned in and explained, "Daddy, remember? I wanted churros that day and called a lady 'ma'am.' She got upset, and you told me to call her 'Ms. Grandma' instead."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That jogged his memory... Anne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca fled from Vivienne's restaurant, utterly directionless. She had no place left to go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked along the river for what felt like hours.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's the point anymore?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her parents looked at her with nothing but disappointment. Her son, so sweet in front of others, had once whispered, "I wish Mommy would die. I wish Grandpa would die. I wish everyone who hit me would die."</span><br><span>This life... is unbearable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared out at the water, glinting under the streetlights. One thought took hold, simple, terrifying, and sudden.</span><br><span>If I jump, it'll all be over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could move, another thought surfaced. Before she died, she wanted to see Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had kept tabs on the Harlows. Liam was dead. Caleb wasn't far behind. Celeste was headed to prison.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Whitfield family, once so arrogant, now stood on the edge of collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If he could do that to his own blood, what chance do we have?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca knew it was all her fault. The mess her family was in... it had started with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I die... would he let them go?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, what the hell are you doing?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone grabbed her from behind, wrapping their arms around her waist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me!" she screamed, thrashing wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why won't they leave me alone?!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she wanted was to see Alistair. To apologize, beg, or kneel, if she had to. She wasn't asking to be forgiven or loved. She just wanted him to spare her family. If someone had to pay for what happened, let it be her. She was the one who ruined his life, and if there was a price to be paid, she was ready to take it&mdash;every last bit of it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't find him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the last person she wanted to see kept showing up. It was Richard again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, I know you hate me, but I came for Danny. No matter how things are between us, I'm still his father. I have a responsibility to raise him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca froze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to raise that child?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Perfect. Be my guest.</span></p></div>
