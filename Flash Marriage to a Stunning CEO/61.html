        <h1>Chapter 61 A Frantic Rebecca</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne followed her gaze with curiosity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca pressed her lips together, heart thundering in her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had almost forgotten&mdash;the first time she met Richard, her heart had raced just like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this </span><span>time, she was certain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne gave a scoff. </span><span>"</span><span>Wearing clothes like that? No way that</span><span>'</span><span>s the broke loser&mdash;</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Anne!</span><span>"</span><span> Rebecca snapped, louder than intended.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne flinched. </span><span>"</span><span>What?!</span><span>"</span><span> she said, eyes wide.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca blinked, suddenly aware she</span><span>'</span><span>d overrea</span><span>cted. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea why Anne</span><span>'</span><span>s words had hit her like a slap&mdash;all she knew was that they sounded vulgar, almost offensive, like they didn</span><span>'</span><span>t belong in the same air she was breathing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You</span><span>'</span><span>ve already found your ideal match,</span><span>"</span><span> Rebecca said, voice taut. </span><span>"</span><span>So m</span><span>aybe watch your words. It</span><span>'</span><span>s unbecoming.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne rolled her eyes. </span><span>"</span><span>All right, all right. I</span><span>'</span><span>ll be more... refined.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after the man had disappeared down the corridor did Anne fully process what had just happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange realization flickered in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Rebecca just defended Alistair</span><span>...</span><span> because she</span><span>'</span><span>d called him broke?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>******</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair rejoined them after a brief detour, he had three warm churros in hand, each wrapped neatly in wax paper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever they had the time, the three of them liked to go </span><span>for walks like this, just to enjoy the breeze and the quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed the first churro to Eloise, who took it with both hands.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Daddy," she said sweetly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second was offered to Caroline, who accepted it with a smile. "Thanks, honey."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The las</span><span>t one he kept for himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The evening air was crisp and cool. They strolled slowly along the lakeside trail, stopping occasionally to take in the view&mdash;just like any other ordinary family of three.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft spring breeze brushed past, lifting away the linger</span><span>ing edge of Alistair's earlier frustration, which had come on the heels of a sudden, belated clarity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had been quietly observing him. When she noticed that his mood had finally leveled out, she began to relax.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, something caught her eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head just in time to see someone dart behind a billboard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her brows knit in quiet suspicion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca never imagined she'd find herself doing something this pathetic&mdash;lurking behind an ad board like some disturbed voyeur.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the person she wa</span><span>s following... was Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone had asked her why, she wouldn't have known how to explain it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peeking cautiously from behind the signage, she watched the little family walking farther and farther away. Their laughter floated back on the breeze. The</span><span> more distant they became, the heavier the silence in her chest grew, pressing against her ribs with a slow, gnawing ache.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally understood that...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If their previous encounter could still be rationalized&mdash;maybe Alistair had staged it to get back at he</span><span>r for choosing Richard, maybe he'd hired someone to play house with him in public&mdash;then what about this? This couldn't have been planned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no way of knowing she'd be here tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca bit down hard on her lower lip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's really remarried? He's som</span><span style="font-style: italic;">eone else's husband now? Someone else's daughter calls him "Daddy"?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A swell of indignation rose in her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We've only been divorced for how long? How could he move on so fast?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, she didn't step forward to confront him. She didn't even try.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she couldn't think of a single reason that would justify it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were divorced. Papers signed, names crossed out, done. The bridge had been burned; they were strangers now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She drifted home like a ghost, walked into her condo, and was struck by ho</span><span>w still everything was. The silence stretched across every surface like dust. For a brief moment, she remembered how Alistair used to wait for her in the living room no matter how late she came home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he was only following orders, the fact that some</span><span>one had been there&mdash;had waited&mdash;was more comforting than the empty space she stood in now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something bitter began to spread through the air around her, thick and unspoken.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Rebecca didn't call it regret.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's just loneliness. That's all. I'm not used to b</span><span style="font-style: italic;">eing alone yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly crouched to the floor and covered her face with both hands, the silence closing in until she couldn't tell whether it was sadness or exhaustion weighing her down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even notice when the front door opened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard stepped</span><span> inside and saw her immediately&mdash;slumped in the center of the room, face buried in her hands, shoulders trembling like a soaked stray cat curled against a curb.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a dry, soundless scoff.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Of course.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't called or begged him to come back like </span><span>she usually did, but he knew she had to be falling apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even regretted giving in to his mother's nagging and coming over to check on her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he'd waited just a little longer, he figured, she would've broken down and called him herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right on </span><span>cue, after a few more minutes of silent sobbing, she fumbled through her purse for her phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard stepped out quietly and shut the door behind him with deliberate care.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned back against the white hallway wall, pulled out his phone, and waited for</span><span> it to ring, the corners of his mouth twitching upward in smug amusement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Tch. Mom really thinks Rebecca's getting harder to handle? Please.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew her like he did. Rebecca would never truly leave him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, she threw the occasional tantrum, played th</span><span>e cold card and tried to act untouchable. But all he had to do was disappear for two or three days and she'd crumble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now? Just wait. He was always right.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he waited.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes. Nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stayed patient. Still no call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, he picked up t</span><span>he phone and held it in his hand, watching the screen like it might change its mind. Another ten minutes ticked by. Still nothing. No texts. No calls. No missed notifications.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, staring at his phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell? Did she forget my number?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impos</span><span>sible. She had it saved under "My Dearest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it clicked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's hesitating. Still too proud. Probably sitting there trying to figure out what to say&mdash;how to make it sound like I'm the one who should come crawling back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the house, the dial tone dro</span><span>ned through the speaker.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The number you have dialed is not in service."</span></p></div>
