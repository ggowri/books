        <h1>Chapter 223 She Believed Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did you get this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down Caroline's face, falling in heavy drops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did you get your hands on it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair crouched beside her and gently dabbed awa</span><span>y her tears with a tissue. "Do you like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do. But how... how did you even pull this off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the face of such an overwhelming surprise, Caroline kept her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair pulled her into a half-embrace, holding her close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she had ope</span><span>ned up to him completely, he no longer wanted to keep anything from her either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll tell you a secret," he said softly. "Actually... I have a system. You know, like... that kind of system. Do you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even hesitating, Caroline nodded. "I </span><span>believe you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair blinked. "You really do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had imagined this scenario before. What would happen if he ever told Caroline about the system?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always figured that someone as rational as she was might say she believed him just to make him happy, but</span><span> deep down, she'd be skeptical. Maybe even suspect he was losing his mind and quietly bring in a doctor behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected her to believe him so easily. And he could tell this wasn't just her humoring him. She truly believed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Choking back tears, Caroline whispered, "My mom used to tell me she'd always find another way to be with me. She never broke a promise. Now I understand. You're the way she chose to stay by my side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair rested his chin lightly on the top of her </span><span>head and looked out at the vast night sky. A silent smile played on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those long, sleepless nights, he had wondered why this unique system had chosen him of all people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it fate finally showing him mercy? Was he chosen because his life had be</span><span>en nothing but suffering?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, Caroline gave him a different explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe he was the one her mother had sent to protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe that really was it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of billions of people in the world, somehow it had to be him who crossed paths with Car</span><span>oline. Who could explain that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was divine will or the love of a mother watching over her daughter from beyond, the fact remained&mdash;they had met. And now that they had, there was no going back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Caroline received news that the entire o</span><span>rganization behind Paige had been dismantled overnight in a coordinated police operation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She made time to visit Paige, with Alistair by her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was still clinging to the delusion that her loyal subordinates would find a way to bust her out. When s</span><span>he heard that her empire, years in the making, had been wiped out in a single night, her mind broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've done so many awful things," Caroline said coldly. "You'd better get used to the idea of staying in here for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two months late</span><span>r, the psychiatric facility reported that Paige had taken her own life during a moment of staff negligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arrogant, delusional, and obsessed with control, she had dragged everyone around her into ruin, and in the end, with no one left to stand by her sid</span><span>e, she died in loneliness and disgrace. A fitting end, actually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew. Another year passed from spring to fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feather Films was preparing to release If There's a Next Second, while Stellar Films was gearing up to premiere their high-budget fea</span><span>ture Before the Music Fades. The two films were set to go head-to-head during the Christmas season.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before its release, Before the Music Fades was being marketed with ferocious intensity. Its promotional campaign was everywhere. The film boasted an A-</span><span>list cast, including an Oscar-winning actor, a chart-topping idol, and one of the most </span><span>talked-about actresses in the industry. With star power and massive fanbases fueling the hype, the movie was already dominating ticket presales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the buzz around Be</span><span>fore the Music Fades was reaching a fever pitch, negative rumors about If There's a Next Second began to quietly spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some claimed that the old theory about Alistair being involved in the death of the Whitfield couple had actually been manufactured by h</span><span>is own team&mdash;just to stir up attention for the film. After all, aside from director Yves, the entire cast was made up of newcomers. Without hype, how else were they going to make a return on investment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, gossip and smear campaigns targeting</span><span> the lead actors of If There's a Next Second began flooding the internet. Most of it was baseless and easily disproven, but that didn't stop certain people from believing it. Diehard fans of rival actors also joined the chaos, fueling the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves, a vet</span><span>eran of the film industry, wasn't fazed. He had seen it all before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before the Music Fades is Giselle's first major project since she started taking over Stellar Films. Her father made it clear that if she wanted to prove herself, this film had to deliver</span><span>. That's why she's pulling out all the stops to secure screen time. We're not the only ones getting attacked. Every movie sharing the release window is getting hit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been worried that Alistair might lose his cool, but when they finally met, Yves fou</span><span>nd that Alistair was calmer than he was&mdash;almost unnervingly composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then again, Yves quickly reminded himself that Alistair didn't exactly lack for money. Maybe, to him, making movies was like a rich kid dabbling in showbiz for fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair wasn't ju</span><span>st playing around. He was talented, and he was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone like him couldn't succeed, then Yves would seriously start questioning the fairness of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's take on the whole thing was unconventional as always. "Bad press is still </span><span>press. There will be people who walk into theaters just to see how bad the movie supposedly is. Once they're inside, they'll realize how much effort we actually put in. In the end, we just have to let the work speak for itself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves nodded. "You might not</span><span> care about all this, but honestly, it's a sign that we're being seen as a real threat. Stellar Films is only targeting the projects they see as competition for Before the Music Fades."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair caught the implication and grinned. "</span><span>So</span><span> The Adventures of Ell</span><span>e the Little Fairy must not have made the cut."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That animated film had originally been slated for a summer Independence Day release, but once production started, the timeline became impossible to meet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, the team pushed it to Christmas, right alo</span><span>ngside If There's a Next Second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Adventures of Elle the Little Fairy had gained some traction on streaming platforms last year, but animation was still a niche market and not a box office powerhouse. Stellar Films clearly didn't see it as a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ali</span><span>stair checked the time and stood up. "I've got to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves didn't even blink. "Let me guess. Off to eat lunch with your wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair waved without denying it and then headed home. The housekeeper had already prepped all the ingredients for his lunch. W</span><span>ith practiced ease, Alistair finished cooking, packed the meal into a Thermos, and headed to </span><span>Vireon</span><span> Technologies&mdash;lunch delivery in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped out of the elevator, he ran straight into Gordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their eyes </span><span>met,</span><span> Alistair could tell that som</span><span>ething was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did he have another fight with Caroline?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Gordon realized how much his past neglect had hurt Caroline, he had been walking on eggshells around her. It was obvious that he wanted to make up for it, but Caroline was no longer a </span><span>little girl who could be soothed with a few kind words. She still kept him at arm's length.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon glanced at the Thermos in Alistair's hand. His expression softened a little. He patted Alistair on the shoulder, let out a long sigh, and, without any explan</span><span>ation, quietly said thank you before walking away in silence.</span></p></div>
