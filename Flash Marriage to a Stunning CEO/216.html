        <h1>Chapter 216 Gone Cock</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca stayed at the hospital until nightfall before finally heading home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morgan Villa was silent and </span><span>lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked less like a mansion and more like a lavish tomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood outside for a long time before stepping through the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she crossed the threshold, a glass came hurtling toward her out of nowhere and smashed against her shoulder.</span><span> "You filthy bitch! Where the hell have you been?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca staggered from the impact but didn't react. She simply looked at him and, a second later, asked softly, "Do you want some water?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard was sprawled out on the couch, drunk and reeking of alcoho</span><span>l. The once pristine, opulent villa now looked more like a landfill than a luxury home. The air was thick with a foul stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stumbled over and grabbed her by the throat. "You think this is funny, don't you? Laughing at me in your head?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa had </span><span>been arrested. The death penalty was practically guaranteed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father, Edmund Morgan, had suffered a heart attack from the shock and had been hospitalized. Doctors said he didn't have long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overnight, the Morgan family had become a pariah. Everyone treat</span><span>ed them like some contagious disease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth had come out. In order to devour the Whitfield Group, they had plotted, manipulated, and destroyed literally and financially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone had dug up Theresa's scandalous past, including how she climbed her way in</span><span>to power as a homewrecker. The two children of Edmund's first wife&mdash;forced to leave the country years ago&mdash;had returned and exposed everything in a public interview. The story exploded. The media went wild. Even the household staff quit, unable to stomach it</span><span> anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once magnificent villa now stood empty, filled only with decay and suffocating silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca hit the floor hard. Richard collapsed on top of her, his grin twisted and maniacal. "I might be a mess, but that doesn't give you the right to glo</span><span>at. Don't forget, I can ruin you any time I want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca lay there for a while, unmoving. Eventually, she climbed to her feet, ignoring the cuts on her arms from the broken glass. She walked to the kitchen, poured a glass of water, and brought it to Rich</span><span>ard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed with contempt, snatched the glass, and downed half of it in one gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened his eyes again, he was tied to a chair, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca sat a few feet away, staring off into space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is this?! Untie me, you crazy b</span><span>itch, or I swear I'll make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca turned her head slowly and gave him a smile&mdash;if it could even be called that. It looked more like a grimace stretched across a lifeless face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman in front of him was nothing like the vibrant girl he once kn</span><span>ew. Her youth was gone, replaced by something hollow and corpse-like. She looked far older than her years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said let me go, you bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard writhed in the chair, trying to break free. The scraping of the chair legs against the concrete echoed through</span><span> the room. Sweat poured down his face, but the ropes held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca just kept staring, smiling that eerie, silent smile. The light in her eyes was gone&mdash;replaced by something dark and twisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard felt his scalp tighten. A slow, creeping fear took over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she didn't even seem human. She looked like a ghost that had crawled out of a horror movie to claim a soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started screaming. "Help! Somebody help me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a minute or two of frantic yelling, he began to realize something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There w</span><span>ere no windows, no hint of the outside world. The walls were thick and soundproofed, sealing in the silence. This was a basement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she was so calm. She knew no one would hear him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?! Do you even know what you're doing?! This is</span><span> a felony, Rebecca! I'm warning you&mdash;calm down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic shook his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca chuckled. Then she stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he was genuinely terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw the scissors in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let her hair fall wild over her shoulders and took slow, deliberate steps </span><span>toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No&mdash;stay away! Don't come near me! Please, Rebecca! Please!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood in front of him, looking down with that same vacant smile, her eyes burning with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is funny, right?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Not funny! Not one bit! Please let me go! I swe</span><span>ar, Rebecca, I'll delete all those photos. I'll give you your freedom. I won't bother you ever again, I promise. Please! I swear I'll never cross you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, he felt a wet warmth in his pants. He'd pissed himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebec</span><span>ca's face twisted with disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disgust at him, and disgust at herself for ever loving someone so vile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised the scissors and clicked them once in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard burst into tears, gasping sobs. "Rebecca, I'm sorry! I know I messed up! But I'm Danny</span><span>'s father. Please, for his sake, just give me another chance. Don't hold it against me. Please..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca tilted her head, watching him. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope flared in Richard's chest. Just like before, she was still easy to manipulate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He blinked quickly to h</span><span>ide the glint in his eyes, for the thoughts in his head were pure venom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he got out, he'd make her pay&mdash;strip her of everything, ship her off to some godforsaken place, and leave her begging for death for the rest of her miserable life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet then she sm</span><span>iled again. "If you can bring my parents back," she said calmly, "I'll let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sliver of hope he'd clung to vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't hurt them!" he cried. "It was my mom! It was her! I didn't know what she was planning. I s</span><span>wear, Rebecca, I had no idea! If I'd known, I would've stopped her. I never would've let that happen. Your parents are my in-laws. They're Danny's grandparents. I'd never hurt them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca didn't respond. She just stood there, her expression dark and unr</span><span>eadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard began sobbing again, completely unraveling. "I was wrong, okay? I was a bastard. I hurt you, I betrayed you, I know that. But please, let me make it right. That evil woman is facing the law now. She's going to be executed! I had nothing to</span><span> do with it. You have to believe me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to make it right?" Rebecca asked quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard nodded frantically. "Yes, yes, yes! Just give me a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then tell me. How exactly do you plan to do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes darted around, searching for something,</span><span> anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just keep her calm. Say what she wants to hear. Stay alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know how much you love Alistair," he said quickly. "I can help you win him back. I swear I can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of Alistair made Rebecca's expression fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That </span><span>actually does move me," she murmured with a faint smile. "But how can I trust that you really have what it takes to make him come back to me? You want me to believe you, you'll have to pay a deposit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard chuckled nervously, not quite getting it. "What</span><span> kind of deposit? Just name it. Whatever it is... if I can do it, I will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This bitch. She's still pining after Alistair? Even now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's smile twisted into something even more sinister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard felt a chill crawl up his spine. And before he could say </span><span>another word, Rebecca crouched down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"NO! AAAAAAAHHHHHH!"</span></p></div>
