        <h1>Chapter 226 The Breakout Studio</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the most explosive headline of the Christmas holiday season?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a doubt</span><span>, it was the stunning breakout of If There's a Next Second, the debut film from a newly founded studio called Feather Films.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the fourth day of the new year, Before the Music Fades had already lost momentum. Its early dominance faded fast as word of mout</span><span>h turned sour, and for the first time since its release, its daily box office dropped below 100 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Yves' film If There's a Next Second was soaring. Rave reviews poured in from every direction, and moviegoers began spreading the word on t</span><span>heir own. More and more people were heading to the theaters out of sheer curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even came back for second and third viewings. The film had officially gone viral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't the only Feather Films production taking off. The Adventures of Elle th</span><span>e Little Fairy, a completely different genre with a very different audience, was also climbing the charts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for someone to point out that both films, despite being so different, were produced by Feather Films.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And both were </span><span>written by Alistair&mdash;or, in the case of The Adventures of Elle the Little Fairy, co-written. The other credited writer? Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stellar Films could no longer stay quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the Music Fades had been a major investment. Unless it hit the 1 billion </span><span>mark</span><span>, i</span><span>t wasn't even going to break even. And now, with total earnings not even reaching 500 million and theaters drastically reducing its screenings, even crossing the 1 billion line was starting to look like a fantasy. It had once been projected to bring in fiv</span><span>e times that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adding to the sting was the fact that If There's a Next Second had originally been one of their own projects. But when Alistair became the target of a smear campaign, Stellar Films had cut ties and publicly canceled production. In </span><span>response, Alistair had funded the project himself. Director Yves stood by him. Thanks to a powerhouse crew and passionate performances from the cast, they delivered a film that dazzled audiences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Stellar Films had become the industry's biggest cau</span><span>tionary tale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, humiliated, attempted to fight back by hiring bots to smear If There's a Next Second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before her plan even gained traction, an old video surfaced online&mdash;one showing her bullying a fellow student back in school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glamorous, pic</span><span>ture-perfect Giselle was suddenly public enemy number one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat on the floor in shock, watching servants frantically pack her things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never imagined her life would spiral like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Paige went down, Giselle had spent weeks panicking, convin</span><span>ced that Caroline had something to do with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline, after all, was a vengeful queen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had been the one who hired people to spread malicious rumors about Alistair. And if Caroline ever found out, there was no way she'd let it slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But nothing </span><span>happened. Time passed, and eventually, Giselle let her guard down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't just anyone&mdash;she was Giselle Reeves. </span><span>So</span><span> what if Caroline was Gordon's daughter? She was untouchable, and Caroline knew it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or maybe, just maybe, Caroline never even realized she h</span><span>ad been behind it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she understood. It wasn't that Caroline hadn't known. And it definitely wasn't because she was afraid. The time simply hadn't been right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the scandal was too big to ignore. Giselle had become a national disgrace. Her own fam</span><span>ily, desperate to protect their name, made the painful decision to cut her off and send her overseas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-flawless Giselle, who used to travel with an entourage, now walked into the airport all alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the departure lounge, a television screen was p</span><span>laying an interview on one of America's most prominent entertainment channels. Director Yves and several cast members from If There's a Next Second were being featured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves was recounting the many setbacks during filming. He said that following his gut an</span><span>d sticking with the project had been the best decision of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle silently crushed the soda can in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heaven and hell really could be just one step apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had all the bitterness in the world, but no way to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as the famil</span><span>y's disgrace, even returning home would be nothing but a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The runaway success of If There's a Next Second lifted everyone involved in the film.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even minor supporting actors saw their value skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Janice, who played a major role, her </span><span>career was suddenly on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feather Films moved quickly, signing several cast members, including Janice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the actors who had originally been cast but later dropped out could only wallow in regret. But there are no do-overs in life. The wrong cho</span><span>ices often don't come with second chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feather Films, barely out of the gate, had managed to deliver two major hits in a single season, instantly establishing itself as a rising force in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a storm breaking into a clear sky, the company</span><span> swept through the industry with a force no one could ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's name was no longer followed by terms like loser or gold digger. Bit by bit, it began to carry weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bye, Mommy! I'm off to preschool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bye, sweetheart. I'll drive Eloise tod</span><span>ay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Drive safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Eloise ran to open the door, Alistair spun around and stole a quick kiss from Caroline, cupping her face in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline laughed and gave him a playful nudge. "Go on already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dropping Eloise off, Alistair returned h</span><span>ome and stepped into the conservatory, a warm, light-filled space where vines curled up the walls and blossoms soaked in the morning sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he stepped inside, someone pressed up against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned, surprised.</span><br><span>Caroline?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time of day, </span><span>she was usually already at the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't said anything about taking the morning off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline leaned her cheek against his back. Her voice was flat, unreadable. "I'm two weeks late this month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a moment for that to register. "What's two we</span><span>eks late?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then it hit him like a freight train.</span><br><span>She means... her period?</span><br><span>"You mean your period is late?" he asked, voice low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a quiet hum of confirmation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had always taken precautions, but nothing was foolproof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alista</span><span>ir slowly turned to face her, eyes dropping to her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a loose home outfit. Her frame was slim as always, her sweatshirt hanging loosely over her flat belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively reached out but caught himself, for his hands were still col</span><span>d from outside. He quickly pulled back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline grabbed his hand and gently pressed it against her abdomen through the fabric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stood there, silent, letting his palm rest against her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There might be a little life growing in there. Our </span><span style="font-style: italic;">child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart began to race. "We're going to the hospital. Now," he said quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline hesitated. "What if it's just a delay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had seen how much he wanted a child. The last thing she wanted was for him to get his hopes up for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's j</span><span>ust a delay, then that still means something's off. We'll check, and if you need it, we'll get you back in balance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He led her into the bedroom to change, handling her as if she were already nine months pregnant. She couldn't decide whether to roll her ey</span><span>es or kiss him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is just a maybe. What'll he be like if it's confirmed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair pulled out a thick, long down coat from the wardrobe. Before they stepped out, he made sure she had on her hat, wrapped a scarf around her neck, and slipped gloves onto he</span><span>r hands. Only then did he take her hand in his and lead her out the door.</span></p></div>
