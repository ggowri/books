        <h1>Chapter 123  Like a Beautiful Dream</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">Nathaniel was drowning in regret.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Who would&#x27;ve thought Alistair, of all people, would end up with someone like Caroline—a woman known in elite circles as a brilliant, sharp-minded business genius?</p><p style="text-align:left;">At Mabel&#x27;s, he smiled politely, made all the right pleasantries, and then carefully steered the conversation toward Alistair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He casually mentioned that Daniel had been asking about his dad. Mabel tilted her head. &quot;His dad&#x27;s not around?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nathaniel sighed, &quot;The parents are divorced.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mabel gave a sympathetic nod. &quot;It&#x27;s always the kids who suffer when things fall apart between adults. If there&#x27;s any way to make it work, maybe hold on until he&#x27;s older... So, what caused the split?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nathaniel froze.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eventually, he admitted the truth—that Alistair used to be his daughter&#x27;s husband—and that he was hoping Alistair could come visit Daniel sometime.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Because the truth was, this whole mess started and ended with Alistair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If Alistair hadn&#x27;t broken off from the family, Vireon Technologies wouldn&#x27;t have blacklisted Whitfield Group. And if that hadn&#x27;t happened, none of the chaos that followed would&#x27;ve unfolded.</p><p style="text-align:left;">To fix this, they needed the one person who&#x27;d set it all in motion.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If Alistair agreed to a truce, everything else would fall back into place.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But the real problem was that no one could get in touch with either Alistair or Caroline.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So Nathaniel&#x27;s last resort? Use Daniel as an emotional bargaining chip.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sure, the marriage was over—but the kid missed his father. That had to count for something, right?</p><p style="text-align:left;">He figured Mabel, being the warm and rational woman she seemed to be, would understand.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As long as he could get face time with Alistair, he&#x27;d talk sense into him. Lay it all out—six years of sacrifice, a little injustice maybe, but hadn&#x27;t it led to Alistair getting that two million dollars? That money had helped his family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Back then, Alistair had been meek, accommodating. Nathaniel was sure he still had a chance to reason with him. And if he could get Alistair on his side, Caroline would follow. Or so he thought.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mabel smiled sweetly and said, &quot;But Alistair&#x27;s not his biological father, is he? Doesn&#x27;t feel quite right. Maybe his real dad should spend more time with him. Help build that bond.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Later that night, when Mabel recounted the exchange to Alistair and Caroline, Caroline practically burst with pride. &quot;Grandma, you&#x27;re amazing!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Mabel kept Eloise overnight again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was becoming a routine the little girl loved. Mabel always had the best stories; there was a cute puppy in the house, and—best of all—none of the people who used to call her a burden.<br/>Eloise, who used to cling to Caroline like a lifeline, now adored staying at Ashbourne Manor. She gave her parents a beaming goodbye, reminded them sweetly to go to bed early, and darted off after Nugget into the garden.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alistair, meanwhile, had to pull every charm he had to convince Caroline to take a hot bath with him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">One soak turned into a very long soak.</p><p style="text-align:left;">By the time they got out, Alistair picked up the hairdryer, as he always did, and started drying her hair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Caroline lay flat on the bed, totally relaxed. Once her hair was mostly dry, he coiled the cord, put it away, and then scooped her up into his arms. She curled against his chest, her face nestled against the open collar of his pajama top. Her fingers wandered, lazily tracing the edge of his collarbone.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alistair bent down, brushing his lips against her smooth forehead. &quot;Your grandma asked me today when we were planning on having a baby.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Caroline froze. Her playful fingers stilled.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She looked up, cautious, eyes searching his face. &quot;And what did you say?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alistair ran his fingers through her hair, slow and steady.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her hair was still a little fluffy from the wash—soft, light, and silky smooth.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I told her I&#x27;d go with whatever you wanted.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Caroline glanced at him, trying to keep her voice neutral. &quot;But what about your opinion?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alistair knew what she meant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He really didn&#x27;t have another answer. That was his opinion. Not a polite lie. Not some careful compromise.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But he could tell Caroline was afraid he might be downplaying his real feelings just to accommodate her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So he looked her straight in the eye and said, &quot;That is my opinion.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She didn&#x27;t respond right away. Just looked at him, long and quiet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her eyes were so beautiful, it was hard to look away. Alistair doubted any artist on earth could capture the colors that lived in her gaze.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He murmured, almost to himself, &quot;Is this a dream?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Caroline blinked. &quot;Hmm?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Just... everything&#x27;s so perfect, sometimes I wonder if I&#x27;m dreaming,&quot; Alistair said, his voice low. &quot;You&#x27;re so good, sometimes I feel like I don&#x27;t deserve you. Like I&#x27;m the lucky one in this relationship. And if I&#x27;m honest, I&#x27;m scared. Scared one day you&#x27;ll wake up, realize I&#x27;m not worth it, and leave.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Caroline frowned and poked him in the head with her finger. &quot;What kind of nonsense is that? Don&#x27;t say stuff like that again. Who says you&#x27;re not worth it? You just haven&#x27;t had the chance to show what you&#x27;re capable of.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Worried he might be spiraling into self-doubt again, she rushed to pull him back before the thought took root. What she saw in him had nothing to do with money, titles, or achievements—it was the man he was, the way he carried himself, the quiet steadiness in his character.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She genuinely believed he&#x27;d spent years being dragged down by Rebecca, and if he&#x27;d had the freedom to grow on his own terms, there was no doubt in her mind—he would&#x27;ve become someone remarkable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If I wanted a man who worked himself to the bone, I&#x27;d have married ten of them by now,&quot; she said, &quot;but I didn&#x27;t. I married you. I don&#x27;t need you to suffer or prove anything. Just be happy. That&#x27;s all I want.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re really not embarrassed to be with someone like me?&quot; he asked, half-joking, half-serious. &quot;A guy with no career, no money, living off his wife?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Forget what others thought—he sometimes felt like the world&#x27;s luckiest parasite.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Being with Caroline felt like a fairy tale he didn&#x27;t belong in. She was all grace and brilliance, and he couldn&#x27;t for the life of him figure out what she saw in someone like him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Caroline shot up, nearly bumping into his chin.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I won&#x27;t let you talk about yourself like that,&quot; she snapped. &quot;We&#x27;re married. Our finances are shared. What&#x27;s mine is yours—and vice versa. Yeah, I&#x27;ve got more money. So what? That doesn&#x27;t mean a damn thing. You&#x27;ve given me things no amount of money could ever buy.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She ticked them off on her fingers. &quot;Love. Security. A real home for me and Eloise.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alistair didn&#x27;t argue.<br/><em>She gave me all those things too... which means, technically, I&#x27;m still the one getting the better end of the deal...</em></p></div>
