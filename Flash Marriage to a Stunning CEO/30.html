        <h1>Chapter 30 Richard's Miscalculation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're Danny's biological father?" Nathaniel asked slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard sat stiffly upright, his face etched with remorse. "I apologize, Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield. Back then, I was immature&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel cut him off coldly. "I don't see much maturity now, either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm sorry. I should have come to see you and Mrs. Cordelia Whitfield much earlier. But Rebecca said the timing wasn't right..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel interrupted again, "Are you saying Rebecca also told you to abandon her back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cordelia sat silently beside him, her eyes scrutinizing Richard from head to toe, her thoughts unreadable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard was left speechless. After a long pause, he stood up and&mdash;right in front of Nathaniel and Cordelia&mdash;slapped himself hard across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sharp crack of skin against skin echoed through the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's face burned, but he clenched his teeth and endured the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield, Mrs. Cordelia Whitfield, I was young and reckless back then. I know I was wrong. But I swear&mdash;Rebecca is the only one I've ever loved. Please forgive me, and please allow us to be together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel remained unmoved. "Do you know what I did to Alistair six years ago when Rebecca brought him here and claimed he was Danny's father?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A flicker of unease passed through Richard, but he quickly steadied himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why should I compare myself to Alistair? He's nothing&mdash;a nobody with no power or influence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even if they beat him half to death, they'd just throw some money at the problem and call it done.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm different.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I have the entire Morgan family behind me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No matter how angry Nathaniel is, he'll have to think twice before crossing my family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel continued, "If you can endure the same suffering he went through, then I'll consider your proposal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard was certain Nathaniel was bluffing to test his sincerity. With unwavering resolve, he declared, "I can. I'll accept any punishment for my mistakes. As long as you don't separate me from Rebecca, I'll do anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel smiled, "Good. That's all I needed to hear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He stood, leisurely picking up the alligator leather belt he'd prepared in advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard straightened his spine, his handsome face set in an expression of steel-like determination, as if ready to face martyrdom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel raised his arm high and&mdash;crack&mdash;the belt sliced through the air, landing squarely across Richard's back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caught completely off guard, Richard let out a pained cry and crumpled to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without hesitation, Nathaniel raised his arm again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though Richard's mother had been a mistress, he'd grown up spoiled and coddled, never experiencing such brutality. Stunned, he saw Nathaniel preparing for another strike and instinctively grabbed his wrist, his eyes flashing with venom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cordelia gasped, clutching her chest, her face pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel, however, seemed to have expected this. He smiled amiably, "Didn't you say you'd accept any punishment for Rebecca? One lash and you're already breaking your word?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard jolted and immediately released him. "I'm sorry, Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield. I just wasn't prepared. Please, vent your anger on me. This time, I won't make a sound."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel tossed the belt aside dismissively. "Forget it. This matter is closed. You may leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard brightened. "Then, does that mean&mdash;?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I heard Alistair was whipped so badly he spent half a month in the hospital. But I only took one hit. That means Nathaniel still favors me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His resentment toward Nathaniel faded considerably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Marrying Rebecca isn't entirely impossible," Nathaniel said, sitting back down and sipping his coffee as if his earlier fury had been nothing but an act.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard suppressed the searing pain in his back and looked at him eagerly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But first, answer me this. Do you love Rebecca for who she is, or for her family's status?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard acted as if insulted. "Of course, it's because I love her. Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield, Mrs. Cordelia Whitfield, if I could, I'd cut out my heart to prove it to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel's smile was faint. "Spare us the empty words. We can't actually ask you to carve out your heart. I'll allow you to marry Rebecca&mdash;on one condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard bowed his head. "Name it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Before the wedding, the two of you will sign a prenuptial agreement. Once Rebecca marries you, she becomes part of your family. That means the Whitfield name and all associated assets will have nothing to do with either of you. If you agree, you can get your marriage license tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's jaw dropped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was nothing like what he'd envisioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cordelia watched his reaction, her eyes darkening. Without a word, she stood and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's all. It's late. You may go." Nathaniel's tone was icy as he, too, stood and walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard returned to Rebecca's penthouse in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca sat curled on the sofa, clutching a pillow, her expression hollow. At the sound of the door, she looked up and saw Richard's grim face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her voice was small. "Rick... did you convince my parents?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard frowned, studying her for a long moment before suddenly asking, "Are you really their biological daughter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's eyes welled up. "Why would you say that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Irritated, Richard yanked off his tie and sat beside her in silence. Then, as if struck by realization, his frustration evaporated.<br>I'm still too impulsive.<br>He pulled Rebecca into his arms. "I get it now. Your parents must be testing me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca murmured distantly, "Rick... do you love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard replied without hesitation, "Do you even need to ask? Of course, I do. Who else would I love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then why did you abandon me back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Rebecca, how many times do I have to explain? My parents forced me. I had no choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's voice took on a hollow edge. "Rick, do you really love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's patience frayed, but he forced himself to soothe her. "I love you. Forever. Until the end of the universe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're just saying that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard feigned hurt. "Rebecca, your father whipped me so hard my back is still bleeding. I didn't even stop at the hospital because I was worried about leaving you alone. If you keep doubting me, it'll break my heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca tilted her face up to his. Under the bright lights, the five stark finger marks on her cheek were impossible to miss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her voice was icy. "If you really loved me, how did you not notice half my face is swollen?"</p></div>
