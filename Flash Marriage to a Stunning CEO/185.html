        <h1>Chapter 185 The Secret She Shouldn't Know</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You alright? Don't be so nervous. Grandma's strong. She'll be fine," Alistair said gently, the last shred of worry melting from his chest the moment the system notified him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cancer cells cleared successfully."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Caroline didn't know that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea Mabel had been living with cancer.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second fainting spell had completely shaken her. Maybe it was the unspoken bond between family, but something deep inside her had sensed this coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she rushed into the hospital, the sharp, sterile smell of disinfectant had already overwhelmed her. Always known for keeping her composure, Caroline actually doubled over, gagging from the anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair couldn't imagine how she'd react if she knew the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She'd never be able to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, he had resolved everything quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Good job, me.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently rubbed her back and asked with concern, "Are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline shook her head, eyes red, voice soft and fragile. "I just... I have a really bad feeling. Grandma's always been so healthy. She exercises every day. Ever since that one serious illness when I was a kid, she's barely even caught a cold. But now, two fainting spells in a row? I don't know why, but I just feel so uneasy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair continued rubbing her back, his voice low and soothing. "Do you trust me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline straightened slightly, her tear-filled eyes meeting his.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't slept a wink the night before, and it showed. Her complexion was ghostly pale, her lips drained of all color. She looked like a porcelain doll that might shatter from a single touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's heart ached for her. He reached out instinctively and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline wrapped her arms around him and whispered, "I trust you. Grandma's going to be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was psychological, but the second she heard those words, her heart finally began to settle.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't linger near the restrooms. Their minds were still with Mabel, so they hurried over.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Paige was falling apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every few seconds, she'd sneak a glance at Gordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't look her way even once.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As much as she hated to admit it, Paige knew deep down that everyone was blaming her for what happened. If she didn't show some kind of remorse, she might never be allowed back into Ashbourne Manor again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment of internal debate, she finally walked over to Gordon. "Gordon, today was my fault. I didn't realize how fragile Mom was. I'll be more careful from now on. I promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon gave her a glance but didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige didn't know what else to say, so she just stood there awkwardly beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle, left standing alone a few feet away, looked visibly uncomfortable. Truth be told, she hadn't even wanted to come. But with Mabel being the one rushed to the ER, she hadn't had much of a choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige came, and she couldn't just pretend it had nothing to do with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">God, I shouldn't have come.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Mabel to be this emotionally vulnerable. One upsetting conversation and the woman had collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all the upsetting talk? That was Paige's doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But clearly, the Ashbourne family wasn't just blaming Paige&mdash;they were holding Giselle responsible, too.</span><br><span>This is so unfair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about the way Caroline looked at her&mdash;eyes cold as death&mdash;still made her skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That woman is a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even hesitate to slap her own aunt in front of everyone. As for Giselle? She was a nobody by comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle never wanted to have anything to do with Caroline again. If she ever ended up marrying Caroline's cousin Leo, she'd keep her distance, like far, far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Caroline not been in such a hurry to get to the hospital, she likely wouldn't have been spared either.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle's stomach twisted in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it suddenly occurred to her that Caroline still ended up with a murderer, despite all her power and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the arrest went public, Caroline would become the biggest joke in town. Her reputation would tank, and even Ashbourne Group might suffer. Compared to that, her falling into the pool at her birthday party suddenly didn't seem like such a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking that brought Giselle a strange sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her neck was starting to ache from standing too long, so she rolled her shoulders and stretched. That was when she noticed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, walking toward her with a bottle of water in hand, passed it to Caroline. "Here. Drink something."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a stare on him, Alistair looked over and caught Giselle mid-gawk, her eyes wide like she'd just seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a small, amused snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So this was the girl who used to bully Caroline?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second their eyes met, Giselle jerked like a spooked deer and immediately looked away, glancing helplessly toward Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Paige was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Gordon, as if they were facing the crisis together.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Giselle hesitantly walked over and tugged at Paige's sleeve. Paige was lost in thought and didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor emerged from the emergency room.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a relaxed, reassuring smile. Gordon stepped forward immediately. The doctor reached out to shake his hand. "Mr. Gordon Ashbourne, good news. Madam Ashbourne is stable. She's going to be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon smiled politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't a smile of relief. It looked almost... empty. Like he wasn't quite sure how to feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige clutched her chest and exhaled loudly. "Thank God. Thank God she's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon glanced at her without saying anything. The look in his eyes made Paige's stomach drop, and she shut her mouth on instinct.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to those behind him, Gordon finally broke into a warm smile. "Did you hear that? Your grandma's going to be just fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That line was clearly directed at Caroline. But as he spoke, his gaze lingered&mdash;almost imperceptibly&mdash;on Alistair as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was for both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to the doctor and said quietly, "Thank you. Do you have a moment? I'd like to speak with you privately about my mother's condition."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor nodded. "Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a friendly nod to Alistair, who was approaching from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a coincidence&mdash;Jaxon was on call again today.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon raised an eyebrow.</span><br><span>They know each other?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Paige, finally starting to calm down, noticed something strange in Giselle's expression. She glanced behind her and froze. There, standing calmly in the hallway, was someone who shouldn't have been there.</span><br><span>Alistair?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's jaw dropped. "What are you doing here? Weren't you just arrested&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's icy stare sliced straight through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police hadn't released any public information about the case. So how did Paige know?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way anyone from Ashbourne Manor had told her. Gordon had gone to great lengths to keep Mabel and Eloise in the dark. He'd specifically instructed Alban not to let a word slip.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So then... how did Paige find out?</span></p></div>
