        <h1>Chapter 83 Caroline Likes Someone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline pretended to be annoyed and said, "What do you mean? Are you saying that Rebecca is better than me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was stunned. He wondered if Caroline had lost her comprehension because of the fever last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course not. I mean, it's beneath you to compare yourself to her. She's far inferior to you," Alistair said helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline stared at him seriously, trying to figure out whether he was lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more she looked at him, the more she thought that Alistair's appearance was exactly to her taste. If Alistair were a dish, she would want to gobble him up right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I won't beat around the bush. To be honest, I've fallen for a guy, but I'm afraid he won't like me..." Caroline feigned distress. At this moment, she was no longer the tough and decisive CEO but a little girl troubled by love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair felt an inexplicable sense of despair in his heart.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Does Caroline have a crush on someone? How could she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he thought that Eloise would soon call someone else "Dad", he felt very uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Alistair thought of the scene where Caroline would call another man "honey" and sleep with that man and be deeply in love with him. He suddenly found it even more unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how shocked he was inside, Alistair remained calm on the surface, and his smile remained. "Don't sell yourself short. You're so excellent and beautiful. No man would look down on you unless he's a clergyman." Alistair refuted himself in his heart.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Clergymen are also human beings. They also have emotions and desires...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's eyes lit up slightly. "Really? I feel more confident now that you said that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Caroline's smile, Alistair felt extremely distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To hide his unusual state, Alistair picked up the water glass in front of him and pretended to take a calm sip. "When are you going to express your feelings to that guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline frowned worriedly. "But what if he doesn't like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was stunned. Even someone as excellent as Caroline would feel uneasy when it came to the person she liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair pretended not to care and casually asked, "He must be great, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's eyes were filled with tenderness. "Yes, he's the most wonderful man I've ever met in my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair tried to ignore his own feelings and cheered her on. "Don't back down. There's no medicine for regret in this world. When the chance comes, you should hold on to it firmly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline frowned and remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Alistair felt a pang of jealousy in his heart.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Who on earth is that man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since that man could catch Caroline's eye and make a genius like Caroline hesitate, he must be an extremely outstanding person, someone that Alistair thought was out of his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That indescribable feeling of frustration made Alistair's mood sink to the lowest point. Not to mention that he was a down-on-his-luck loser who didn't even have a high school diploma; even if he hadn't been blocked by others' schemes and had successfully gone to college, he still wouldn't be worthy of Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At best, he was just an ordinary person who worked hard. Compared to an absolute genius, Alistair was like a worthless ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was ridiculous. A person as useless as he was actually dared to imagine being with Caroline. He thought he was incredibly shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was a bit angry. She had said that she liked a guy, but Alistair didn't show any reaction at all. She thought that Alistair should at least show a bit of concern to please her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was too good at pretending. He was so jealous that he was almost dying inside, yet he could manage not to show any emotions on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair pretended to be concerned and asked, "Does he get along well with Eloise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no doubt that Eloise was extremely important to Caroline. An important prerequisite for Caroline to choose a partner was that Eloise should like her new lover. It was precisely because he had won Eloise's trust that he had the honor of being Eloise's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alistair asked this question, his heart was pounding wildly. He didn't know what he was nervous about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline nodded. "Eloise likes him very much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair clenched his fists, and the sourness in his heart turned into waves of bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He should know his place. Among so many men, he wasn't the special one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair belatedly realized that, ever since he had moved in, apart from when Eloise was in kindergarten, he had been taking care of her at other times. That meant this man wasn't someone Caroline had recently met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair pondered. Since Caroline had already found the man she loved, he didn't understand why she had persuaded him to register for marriage. If the man Caroline had a crush on found out about this, it would definitely be detrimental to the development of their relationship. Alistair's heart sank slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given the absurdity of her first marriage, Alistair almost immediately thought that perhaps because Caroline didn't know the man's feelings for her, she deliberately used Alistair to test that man.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">But if that's the case, she could just pretend with me. There's no need to even get a marriage certificate with me...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was in a state of confusion. On the one hand, he felt that his inference was reasonable, but on the other hand, he also felt that there were so many contradictions that it couldn't withstand scrutiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was restless, but he managed to keep his emotions in check on the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's eyes were filled with tenderness. "He's gentle, kind, steady, down-to-earth, mature, and reserved..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said a lot of words of praise in one breath, making Alistair wonder if there really was such a perfect man in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps Caroline had a filter on her crush and thought he was perfect. Alistair couldn't help but wonder if he had ever met this person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he dismissed this question. His social circle was too small, so he thought that Caroline's crush should be a public figure. With Caroline's status and social standing, she should know all the people who often appeared on TV or the Internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Caroline praised the man she loved to the skies, she stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair couldn't hold back and asked, "Do I know this person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline nodded. "Of course you do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair silently clenched his fists, and the image of him picking up his luggage and leaving flashed through his mind. He felt an overwhelming sense of desolation in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had never expected that the day of separation would come so quickly. He had naively thought that he could really accompany Eloise to grow up, but it was obviously impossible now.</span></p></div>
