        <h1>Chapter 138 Done With His Blood Family</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When your parents sold me off for two million and used the money to buy a big house, when the three of you lived in comfort under that new roof, did it ever cross your mind that I was family? When you used part of that money to study abroad and live it up, did you think for even one second that I was your kin?" Alistair's voice was sharp, his words like blades.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You never could beat me, Caleb. Not once. Even when your family used the dirtiest, most despicable tricks to drag me through the mud, I still got back up. I won. And you? You'll always be the one who lost. That's the truth, one you'll never change."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't wait for Caleb's reaction. One final glance at that defeated face, and Alistair turned and walked out of the hospital.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, he had already spoken to the doctors. Caleb's condition wasn't looking good. If he survived the next forty-eight hours, it would be a miracle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, that might be the easy way out for him. If he somehow pulled through, he'd be facing the full weight of the law, years of punishment for attempted murder. A lifetime of misery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair scoffed at the thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to resent Liam for caring more about his stepson than his actual son. But back then, Alistair had blamed himself, thinking maybe he just wasn't good enough, or maybe he didn't behave the way a son should.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, when they cut ties completely, Alistair had a flash of suspicion. What if Caleb wasn't a stepson at all? What if he was Liam's biological child?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To find out, he quietly sent off hair samples from both Caleb and Liam for DNA testing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The results came back quickly. And he felt nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Alistair had already stopped expecting anything from Liam. Learning they were actually father and son didn't even make him flinch. It just made him feel sorry for his mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she passed, and the haze of grief finally lifted, Alistair realized that Liam had erased every trace of her from the house. He claimed it was to avoid painful memories, that the living had to move on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair knew the real reason. He didn't want Celeste to feel uncomfortable. That was how little his mother had meant to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Alistair didn't even have a photo left. When the nights got long and quiet, he had to rely on memory alone to recreate her face, piece by piece, just to feel close to her again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cruel irony was that while Liam pampered Caleb like a treasure, it was the "disappointing" son who handled the final arrangements.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Caleb shoved him down the stairs, Liam bled out and died on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had no intention of holding a funeral. He had Liam's body sent straight to the crematorium. His ashes were buried somewhere in the wilderness, beneath a nameless tree.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sunlight streamed down, warm and blinding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam was dead. Caleb was almost gone. Celeste was about to go to prison, and with any luck, she'd spend her remaining years suffering the pain of burying her own child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she survived prison and somehow made it back into the world, Alistair wasn't the least bit concerned. If she tried anything, taking her down would be effortless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, his hatred for his blood family had reached its final chapter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not all debts had been paid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still Rebecca. Alistair didn't need to deal with her personally. She'd already met her match, and he was content to let one monster devour another.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you okay?" Caroline asked softly, seated in the car, waiting for him like always.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave her a reassuring smile. "Told you I'd be back in a few. You didn't have to worry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached for his hand, not just to hold it, but to interlace their fingers tightly, deliberately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her way of telling him, "Whatever happens, I'm here. I'm your family now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about pizza tonight? Viv's Brickhouse sounds good?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Viv's Brickhouse, run by Vivienne, had been doing great lately. Alistair had even seen some new locations popping up. Clearly, she was expanding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her a warm smile. "Perfect."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, the three of them went to Viv's Brickhouse together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had reserved a table by the window on the second floor. While they ate, the city lights flickered outside, and Alistair sat surrounded by the people he loved most. For the first time in a long time, life felt simple and complete.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ma'am, there's a Ms. Whitfield here to see you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's her full name?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca Whitfield."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Geez..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you'd rather not see her, I can say you're out."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine. Let her in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne closed the monthly report on her pizza franchise and walked to the window, staring absently at the bustling streets below.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A knock at the door. She turned around, cleared her throat, and said, "Come in."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw who walked through the door, her heart skipped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been so long since she last saw Rebecca.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the perfect blend of innocence and allure, Rebecca now looked utterly drained. Her complexion was dull, her eyes lifeless, and her once-glamorous curls had been hastily tied into a limp, brittle ponytail.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Vivienne didn't even recognize her, her former best friend, the girl she'd grown up with.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the raspy voice. "Vivienne."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne's eyes widened. She had never seen Rebecca look like this. The Rebecca she remembered wouldn't be caught dead stepping outside unless she was picture perfect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scandal had rocked the city. She'd heard about the Whitfield family's collapse. Rebecca's name was now mud. All those admirers had vanished overnight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whitfield Group was dragged down with her, and lately, the company had been struggling to stay afloat. Vivienne's parents were convinced that if things kept going this way, it was only a matter of time before the entire Whitfield family went bankrupt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had wondered aloud, "Who on earth did they cross to end up like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne, knowing how sensitive Rebecca could be, quickly forced a smile and tried to mask her shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too late. Rebecca had already seen it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for once, she didn't seem to care.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she almost looked grateful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least Vivienne had tried to hide it. At least she still had enough dignity to pretend she didn't pity her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was more than Rebecca had gotten from anyone lately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, sit," Vivienne said, and poured her a fresh cup of coffee.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca took it with a murmured, "Thank you," then stared at the steaming cup in silence, her heart heavy with grief for the life she could never return to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, neither of them would have said things like "thank you." Once, they had been closer than sisters.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had run away from home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The house had turned into a tomb of silence and tension.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father had collapsed from rage the last time they fought and had to be rushed to the hospital. He survived, but the damage to their relationship was irreversible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mother no longer looked at her with kindness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her son, the golden child, now seemed like a demon to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca? What's wrong? If there's something you need to talk about, just say it. Don't cry." Vivienne scrambled to grab tissues, her voice breaking with worry.</span></p></div>
