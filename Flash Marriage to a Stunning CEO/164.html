        <h1>Chapter 164 A Grave Mistake</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you just&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo never finished the sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eyes bloodshot, he lowered his head, hiding the shock and dis</span><span>appointment written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd caught wind of the scandal surrounding Alistair after the news of Stellar Films' terminated contract. It was all over the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it had never occurred to him that the screenwriter "Alistair" was the same man married to Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In hindsight, it made no sense. Why would someone like Caroline, so meticulous and so exacting, ever marry a divorced man?</span><br><span>That just wouldn't fit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly gutted him wasn't Alistair. It was the fact that his mother had known everything, and still chose to bring it up in front of Mabel.</span><br><span>Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the age difference, she didn't yield an inch, standing face to face with Paige. Her eyes locked onto hers, cold, steady, and merciless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better hope my grandmother pulls through," she said quietly, each word cutting like glass, "because if anything happens to her, I will make sure you live in hell for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Leo, who had grown wary of his mother, couldn't help the chill that ran through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Paige wasn't blameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he also knew Caroline wasn't bluffing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't throw threats around for fun. When she made a promise, she meant it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it involved him, his mother, or even the entire Reed family, Caroline would deliver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo felt cold all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he was scared of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, he would've defended his mother without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what if Caroline was simply protecting herself? What if his mother really had crossed the line?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Paige, Caroline's threat was almost amusing&mdash;though that didn't stop her from flinching under Caroline's glare just moments earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gentle smile, Paige spoke in a tone as soft as spun sugar, "Even if you don't acknowledge me as your aunt, I'm still your grandmother's daughter. Your father's sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a taunt, masked as grace. Her meaning was clear.</span><br><span>You think you're powerful because you're an Ashbourne? So am I. Your threat means nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline, however, wasn't the type to take the bait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what?" she replied coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the two women stared each other down, Alistair was already working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had met Paige face to face, there was no doubt in his mind&mdash;the tension between her and Caroline had nothing to do with his wife. It was Paige. She wasn't just cold. That woman was toxic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that, he understood all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two options appeared in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Option 1: Spend 100 system credits to activate "Secret Obliterator", a reusable asset designed to detonate reputations.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Option 2: Keep thinking.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clicked "Confirm" without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were harmless, some shameful, and some so devastating that if exposed, they could annihilate careers, families, or entire lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Possessing someone's secret was like holding a knife to their throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His goal was simple&mdash;uncover Paige's most dangerous secret. Use it to silence her. Make her vanish. Crush her if needed. As long as she stayed away from Caroline, he didn't care how ugly it got.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the accident involving Nathaniel and Cordelia occurred, Alistair had purchased an "</span><span>E</span><span>vent </span><span>T</span><span>race"&mdash;a full thread of the timeline, including everyone involved and every hidden layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he expected, Paige had her fingerprints all over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what surprised him was that she'd pulled someone else into it, a person who, in Alistair's opinion, didn't need to be there at all. Now that was interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't feel a shred of pity for the scapegoat either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That "scapegoat," Giselle, hadn't been dragged in blindly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She harbored clear resentment toward Caroline. If she hadn't, she wouldn't have walked into Paige's trap so willingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What really caught his attention, though, was how clean Paige's work was. Efficient, and invisible. Even if the real culprit got exposed, she wouldn't be touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No way this is the first time she's done something like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That system tool? Worth every credit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let the authorities run around for now. Alistair would wait and then strike, when the timing was right, without ever revealing himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight between Caroline and Paige had cooled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood a few feet apart, like two strangers who happened to be stuck in the same hallway. Not screaming, not arguing. Just watching and waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a hospital, after all. Mabel was inside, fighting for her life. This wasn't the place to lose control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline leaned slightly into Alistair, her eyes falling on Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in that moment, Alistair realized something important. Caroline had another card to play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Leo ever found out the truth, that Miley was gone, who would he blame? He'd go straight to the one who tore them apart in the first place, Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline wouldn't have to do a thing. That wedge would drive itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had chosen the wrong enemy. She had made a grave, unforgivable mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doors to the operating room opened. A doctor walked out, calm but focused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone moved in at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled down his mask. "Madam Ashbourne is stable. She's out of danger. She'll need rest, but she's going to be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air in the hallway shifted. Tension drained from their shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Alistair notice the way his and Caroline's hands were still clasped, damp, cold, almost clammy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sure whose palm was sweating. Maybe both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thank God she was alright. Even if he hadn't been responsible, he would've been heartbroken if something happened to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything they'd been through, Mabel had come to feel like family. He wanted her to live a long, dignified life. She deserved that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, in her private room, Mabel lay propped up slightly, eyes closed, a drip line in her arm. Everyone had been told to stay quiet while visiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved Paige and Leo away, keeping only Caroline and Alistair behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes fluttered open, and she looked between them, visibly frustrated by her own weakness. Her lips moved slightly, but no sound came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline leaned close, tears pooling in her eyes. "Grandma, don't believe whatever Paige said. Alistair and I would never do anything illegal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone had leaked his conflict with the Whitfield family. Pair that with Rebecca's dramatic street-side apology, and the internet went wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people played detective, trying to piece the whole story together. A large camp applauded Stellar Films for cutting ties just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others just grabbed popcorn and watched the chaos unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The damage spilled into the Ashbourne Group. Their stock price had taken a hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair nodded solemnly. "We want Eloise to grow up seeing the right kind of love. We're not going to ruin this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel's face softened. She smiled faintly, the corners of her eyes creasing with effort. "You're good kids," she whispered. "That's all I needed to hear."</span></p></div>
