        <h1>Chapter 172 A Gold-Digger</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wouldn't be delivering lunch to Caroline today&mdash;he had to spend time with Mabel instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nugget noticed him pause and stuck out its tongue, nudging Alistair's hand with its head. Alistair stroked the dog absently while forcing a smile for Mabel. "How about I pick up Eloise this afternoon? She'd love to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no." Mabel waved him off. "I'm still not feeling myself. If she comes over and I don't have the energy to play with her, she'll just end up bored."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled, but his heart sank. The nagging suspicion that had been eating at him suddenly felt like certainty.</span><br><span>Something's definitely wrong with her health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She adored Eloise&mdash;under normal circumstances, she'd never turn down a visit from her great-granddaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair said, keeping his smile, "Eloise said that when she grows up, she's going to become an inventor and create a medicine that'll make you young again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel's face lit up with delight. "That little angel is going to do amazing things!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So when should I bring her by?" Alistair pressed gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about Saturday? Day after tomorrow," Mabel suggested, her smile softening. "Let her sleep in that morning, then bring her over when she's well-rested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds perfect," Alistair agreed, though worry still gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before lunch, Alban popped up in the doorway and said Paige and Giselle wanna see Mabel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel's expression soured instantly. "For crying out loud, didn't I specifically say I wanted peace and quiet today? No visitors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd even sent Gordon packing for the same reason, despite his plans to stay in New York for a few more days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alban left to relay the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige actually brought Giselle along," Mabel muttered, shaking her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's been pushing Giselle at Leo since they were kids, like I don't know my own grandson. Leo made it crystal clear he was not interested. Why can't Paige take a hint?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The servants finished setting the table, and Alistair helped Mabel to her seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vibrant woman now moved with careful, measured steps. She seemed to have aged years in just a few weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight made his chest tighten. He thought of his grandfather and the pain of losing him. He wasn't ready to go through that again so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at me," Mabel said with a bitter laugh. "Can barely get around anymore. Getting old is hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Alistair, it was another hint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was convinced that she was keeping something from him, dropping breadcrumbs so he wouldn't be blindsided when the truth came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each veiled comment was her way of preparing him for the news she couldn't bring herself to deliver directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept his voice playful. "Just hang in there, Mabel. When Eloise grows up and invents that youth serum, you'll be as good as new."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed, "I'll be waiting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alistair and Mabel shared their lunch, Alban was firmly but politely turning away Paige and Giselle at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being refused entry to her own mother's house&mdash;and in front of Giselle, no less&mdash;clearly stung Paige's pride. Her smile remained perfectly pleasant, but her words dripped with sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So I'm her daughter&mdash;an Ashbourne by birth&mdash;but now that I'm married, I can't even visit my own mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alban smiled, offering no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recognizing she was getting nowhere with the butler, Paige shifted tactics. "Is Carol in there? And that suspect she married? If they're with Mom, I suppose I can stop worrying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth drained from Alban's expression. "Mrs. Paige Reed," he said, "please watch your words carefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dismissal in his tone sent Paige storming off with Giselle in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let it get to you." Giselle soothed as they walked away. "Maybe Madam Ashbourne really is resting. We can try again another day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom's losing it," Paige snapped. "I get that she loves Carol&mdash;blood is blood, even if Carol's clueless. But Alistair? After what he's done to the Ashbourne Group? Our stock price tanked, our reputation's in tatters, and she's having cozy lunches with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is Carol's husband," Giselle offered diplomatically. "Madam Ashbourne probably tolerates him for her sake. You know how grandparents are. But surely Gordon won't let this slide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of Gordon only darkened Paige's mood further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been certain that when Gordon discovered Caroline had secretly married, he'd explode. With Mabel in the hospital, she'd expected him to unleash hell on Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige felt not a shred of guilt about her role in Mabel's hospitalization. She'd been giddy waiting for Gordon's inevitable meltdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her disappointment, nothing happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Mabel and Gordon seemed content to let Caroline do whatever she wanted, leaving Paige thoroughly bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it hit her&mdash;of course. No matter how strained their relationship, Gordon and Caroline were still father and daughter. Blood trumped everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm curious about Alistair," Giselle said, her interest clearly piqued. "What makes him so special?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marrying into the Reed family was Giselle's goal, and she only cared about Alistair because he was Caroline's husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Caroline was famously untouchable. Any man who'd managed to win her over had to be extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The internet was buzzing with stories about Alistair and the Whitfield family scandal, but photos of him were mysteriously scarce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few that existed showed only his back or were too blurry to make out his features, adding to his enigmatic appeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Special?" Paige scoffed. "He's a calculating gold-digger who sleeps his way to the top."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's description only intensified Giselle's curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank God you've always had your heart set on Leo," Paige continued, sounding relieved. "At least you'll never fall for some scheming gold-digger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do have good taste," Giselle said. "Though Leo's always been so distant with me."</span></p></div>
