        <h1>Chapter 208 The Murder Case</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashbourne... are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's assistant looked at him with deep concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd followed Gordon for years. Unlike other CEOs who wore suits by day and masks by night, Gordon seemed born for the boardroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Work was all he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sleep. Eat. Work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every day, he did the same things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like a routine that would never end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women threw themselves at him constantly. All of them varied from sizes to appearances, but he never cared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Gordon was a man who'd been scarred by marriage. When it came to love, all he offered was cynicism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the woman he once believed had betrayed him... turned out to be just another casualty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, if this was all a misunderstanding, maybe you could still find her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Find her? Where?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon gave a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He staggered to his feet, but the moment he straightened, a wave of dizziness rushed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashbourne!" the assistant cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon reached out, grabbing his arm to steady himself while shaking his head to calm him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the door, Derek was being blocked by two bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Gordon's word, no one got out, not even a fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter?" Derek sneered. "Afraid I'll go public with your dirty laundry? Tryin' to kill me off now? Please. I didn't show up here just to beg for my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's gaze was sharp, but his voice stayed level. "After all these years, why now? Why tell me this today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek wasn't about to sell out the mysterious person who helped him. He stuck to the lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said he'd known something wasn't right for a long time. He didn't know who had set him up, only that someone had. And that for years, he'd been digging, trying to find the truth. In fact, Derek had done his searching, but he failed to find anything himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon believed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was true. Nothing fueled obsession like hate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek slouched back in his chair, his tone flat. "So what's it gonna be, Mr. Ashbourne? If you're gonna kill me, do it already. I'm not afraid of dying. Just give me a clean exit. You're the big man here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon looked at him for a long moment, then gave a hollow laugh. "Kill you? For what?" he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She would never come back anyway...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a video posted by a local resident on HitTalk showed a man being killed and stuffed into a wooden crate. The body had been discovered during transport, and the suspect had already been taken into custody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The story caught like wildfire in dry brush and spread rapidly across every major platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, Alistair and Caroline were out with Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The AI Technology Innovation Expo would run for three days, from ten in the morning to nine at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise was fascinated by the robot Caroline's company had developed. After dinner, the couple brought her to the venue so she could see it in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On a weeknight, the crowd was noticeably larger, and there were more children around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many families came in the evening, and adults who couldn't make it during work hours rushed in after clocking out. The place was busier than it had been all day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise's eyes were wide with curiosity as she listened intently to the staff from Vireon Technologies explaining the functions and uses of the JR000.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alistair was checking the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Videos of the murder case were all over the internet, filmed from multiple angles by different witnesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a society governed by law, a violent killing like this instantly drew massive attention. Some users even went so far as to link it to the car crash involving Nathaniel and his wife, once again dragging an uninvolved Alistair into the mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, Alistair himself happened to see that particularly popular comment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He preferred to keep a low profile, but somehow he never managed to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't matter. There was a saying&mdash;Blessings sometimes come in disguise. From another perspective, while others paid for exposure, his competitors handed it to him for free. His name was back on the trending list, and "If There's a Next Second" would gain more attention too. That wasn't a bad outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things were going even better than Alistair expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron was a buried gem. If he'd been born in a more chaotic time, he might've become a legendary outlaw&mdash;smart, fearless, and sharp. Being just a local gang leader was beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had pulled off Alistair's plan flawlessly. He switched Derek with a double, kept him safe, and released news of the murder at just the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Alistair was now completely sure of Aaron's loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron could be a weapon, and Alistair could give him a future. It was a win-win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline leaned over just as Alistair finished reading, and he casually locked his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave him a look. "Why won't you show me? Hiding something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could respond, she grabbed the phone from his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had fingerprint and password unlock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline placed her thumb on the sensor, and the screen actually lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The headline he had just been reading was still there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline stared at it in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There was a murder on the outskirts of town," Alistair said, noticing her stunned reaction and frowning slightly. "Babe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Caroline to be shaken by something that had nothing to do with them. As far as he knew, she wasn't the type to scare easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made him wonder&mdash;maybe he didn't know her as well as he thought he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe the case had triggered something in her. A horrifying childhood memory, maybe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Alistair thought of that year she'd spent locked away. Quickly, he took back the phone, locked it, and wrapped her in his arms. "Don't worry. I'm here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline murmured, "Why... does my fingerprint work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally realized he had misunderstood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline stared at him and repeated, "Why can I unlock your phone with my fingerprint?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't Paige. She had a sense of possession, sure, but not the kind that suffocated. Maybe it was because Alistair had always made her feel secure. Therefore, during all their time together, Caroline had never once tried to snoop through his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when she grabbed it today just for fun, she was shocked when she managed to unlock it. This was utterly confusing. How? Why? She didn't remember ever saving her fingerprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair said nothing, just smiled quietly. Caroline caught on fast. "When did you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you were asleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered it clearly. It was not long after they got together. That night, they had stayed up late. She had fallen asleep in his arms, but he couldn't sleep at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just kept looking at her, so full of joy he didn't know what to do with it. He kept kissing her, over and over again, like he still couldn't believe this was real. He actually had a family, someone he could cherish. Even if he had to die for her, he would face death without blinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, for some reason, Alistair wanted Caroline to know that he had nothing to hide. Well, except for the fact that he had a system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, he secretly registered her fingerprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held no secret in his phone, and she could check it whenever she wanted.</span></p></div>
