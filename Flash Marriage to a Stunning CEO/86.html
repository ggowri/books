        <h1>Chapter 86 Daniel Was Wrong</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gina, who was handling the matter personally, stiffened. The words she had prepared to say were blocked by what Rebecca said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gina knew that Daniel was a difficult child. Fortunately, he had a reasonable father. Whenever Daniel caused trouble in the kindergarten, his father would come and apologize humbly to the parents of the bullied child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Generally, when other parents saw his sincere attitude, they would say some polite words and let the matter go. Even if there were some parents who were difficult to deal with and said some unpleasant words, Alistair would endure it, leaving them no room to complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the situation of Daniel's conflict this time was different from the simple bullying in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gina had figured out the whole story from the two teachers of the middle class. With her wide experience, she was fairly calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as Rebecca arrived, she firmly believed that her son was the one being bullied. This was not the right attitude for handling the problem. She wanted to overpower others in terms of momentum, but the thing was that Eloise's parents wouldn't let their child be bullied either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Rebecca came, Daniel had been making a fuss, and Gina couldn't subdue him. But as soon as Caroline arrived, with just one look, the little devil didn't dare to cry anymore and stood obediently aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A voice colder than Rebecca's sounded. "Isn't your son the little jerk who bullied others? If you're blind, you'd better go to the hospital. Before that, please ask your son to apologize to my daughter first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca met a pair of icy eyes and was stunned. This woman was the one who had affectionately taken Alistair's arm before and warned her to stay away from Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca pursed her lips tightly and was filled with chagrin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she had known that she would meet this damned woman today, she would definitely have put on delicate makeup before going out and worn her most beautiful clothes to make Caroline feel inferior with her beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was so focused on outshining Caroline that she didn't notice that Caroline had come without makeup and was just wearing casual clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was naturally beautiful. Even without makeup and in casual clothes, she was more eye-catching than Rebecca. In terms of appearance, Rebecca was completely outshone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the tense atmosphere, Gina quickly explained the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca snorted coldly, "According to what you said, it's all Danny's fault. Doesn't she have any fault at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline didn't want to waste words with her and directly motioned for Gina to bring out the surveillance footage for her to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After watching the surveillance and being sure that Daniel had been the one provoking trouble from start to finish, Rebecca felt a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were other parents, Rebecca might have symbolically apologized to them and let the matter go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But facing the woman who had stolen Alistair, Rebecca was full of hostility. Asking her to bow her head and admit her mistake to Caroline was more unbearable than killing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is just the surface, Rebecca said with a straight face, "Maybe in places where the surveillance couldn't capture, your daughter said something that provoked my son, which made my son rush over and push your daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gina and the two teachers were speechless after hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise snuggled in her mother's arms and looked at Rebecca curiously with her big eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is Daddy's ex-wife? She looks so fierce. Daddy's previous child isn't a well-behaved one either.</span><br><span>Eloise suddenly felt sorry for Alistair in the past. Fortunately, he was her father now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise secretly vowed that she must be extremely good to Alistair so that he wouldn't regret being her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline wasn't agitated when she heard Rebecca's groundless accusation. Such a woman wasn't worthy of stirring up her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline smiled and retorted, "Then, may I ask, do you have any evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was taken aback. She didn't know why. Even though she had tried her best to put on airs, she still felt that she was being suppressed by this woman in every way, which made her very unhappy and anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could lose to anyone, but she didn't want to lose to Caroline, because this woman had stolen Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had thought that Alistair's father didn't care about him and his stepmother was shrewd and mercenary. After leaving Rebecca, Alistair would surely be homeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, as long as she beckoned, he would obediently come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for Caroline's interference, Alistair would have obediently come back to take care of Rebecca and Daniel as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca hated Caroline so much that she wished she could die immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was unreasonable and extremely domineering. "Just tell me if there's such a possibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline looked at her as if she were a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was so mad. She could tell this woman thought she was dumber than Daniel, that five-year-old kid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a blatant humiliation to her, but Rebecca really didn't have the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gina wanted to smooth things over, but Caroline gave her a cold glance, and Gina immediately backed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gina knew the power of Rebecca's family and Caroline's family. The Whitfield family was much inferior to the Ashbourne family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, more importantly, Eloise was indeed wronged today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gina wiped the sweat off her face and said, "Ms. Whitfield, the facts are clear. Daniel was wrong this time. How about you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had a cold expression and firmly refused. "You want me to apologize? No way! Isn't it normal for children to have a little quarrel with each other? You couldn't even handle such a small matter and had to call me here to deal with it. Do you know how precious my time is? Can you afford the losses caused by your careless mistake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a series of questions thrown out, even Gina, who wanted to resolve the matter amicably, couldn't help but frown.</span></p></div>
