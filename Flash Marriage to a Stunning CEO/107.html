        <h1>Chapter 107 The Adopted Child</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why isn't Mom up yet? Is she feeling unwell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During breakfast, Eloise didn't see Caroline. Glancing at the firmly closed bedroom door, her little face revealed obvious concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had anticipated the question and prepared his response carefully. "Mom had some unexpected work last night and stayed up very late, so she needs to catch up on her sleep today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lying wasn't good, but this was a necessary white lie told with good intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before taking Eloise to kindergarten, Alistair made a point to check himself in the mirror. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He buttoned his shirt all the way to the top collar, making absolutely certain that none of the suspicious, intimate marks underneath were visible. Only then did he feel comfortable leading Eloise downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing the front door close, Caroline stirred lazily under the blanket. Every inch of her body ached as if she had been completely disassembled and then roughly put back together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet she knew perfectly well that Alistair had been very restrained and gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She drifted back into a hazy sleep. Some time later&mdash;she wasn't sure how long&mdash;she sensed someone watching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, when she'd experienced sleep paralysis, she'd often felt someone standing by her bed. The terrifying sensation of wanting to open her eyes to check but being completely unable to was something she'd never forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, even though she clearly sensed someone watching her from beside the bed, she felt completely at ease. She knew without a doubt it was Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't slept enough and wanted to drift off again, but she also wanted to see the person by her bed. Even though he was completely hers now, and she could look at him whenever she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she finally opened her eyes and saw him, memories of their intimate night together flooded back. She shyly pulled the cotton blanket up to hide her blushing face, revealing only her large eyes, slightly misty with sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A twinge of guilt washed over Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had been the first time for both of them. Despite how careful and gentle Alistair had tried to be, he'd still caused her discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next time, he promised himself, he would be even more attentive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of next time, and the time after that, and countless more times in their future together...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's shy, vulnerable expression made Alistair's Adam's apple bob involuntarily. "Are you hungry?" he asked in a soft voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then get some more sleep. When you wake up, I'll make you whatever you want to eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was an excellent cook!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though so far, he'd only demonstrated his skills once for Caroline and Eloise, making them simple pasta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was afraid of tiring him out and wouldn't give him a chance to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's eyes narrowed slightly in a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair gently stroked her head. "Get some sleep," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair waited until she was sound asleep before reluctantly placing a kiss on her forehead and quietly slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was thinking about making chicken noodle soup for Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to simmer it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he took out the ingredients, the cook hurried over to stop him. "Let me handle this! This isn't work for you to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After much persuasion, he finally convinced the cook to let him make it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You two lovebirds are so sweet together. Madam Ashbourne must be relieved now. Mr. Harlow, I can tell you're a good man, and Ms. Ashbourne is a fortunate girl," the cook said with a genuine smile as she untied her apron, showering Alistair with heartfelt compliments before leaving early for the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooking for loved ones was truly a pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The chicken noodle soup had been simmering on low heat all morning, filling the kitchen with an irresistible aroma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had finally gotten enough sleep and regained some of her energy; however, she would need several more days to recover completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Caroline's half-teasing, half-resentful stare, Alistair rubbed his neck, offering an awkward smile. "Sorry, I'll definitely be more careful next time," he promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline pounced on him playfully, pretending she would bite him to avenge her poor, helpless self. "Be careful about what exactly?" she demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline gazed with satisfaction at Alistair's reddening earlobes. She loved seeing him blush like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling Alistair's mischievous gaze on her, Caroline suddenly snapped to attention. He quickly turned the tables, gripping her slender waist and pulling her upper body against his. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a playful smirk, he leaned in close and whispered seductively, "What do you think, honey?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline struggled to maintain her composure. "What?" she managed to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair smiled, "Honey, would you like me to help you shower? I could scrub your back for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The brilliant business tycoon, who dominated the corporate world, finally acknowledged her defeat. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With flushed cheeks and burning ears, she glared at Alistair, pushed him away, and fled into the bathroom, slamming the door with a thunderous bang. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone witnessing this would have thought Alistair was some kind of dangerous monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair chuckled softly to himself as he set aside his teasing mood and started making the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had mild OCD and couldn't stand disorganized items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he pulled back the covers, his gaze suddenly froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The blanket was white, and the sheets were white too. Against this pristine backdrop, several bright red rose stains appeared, impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why?</span><br><span>Alistair stared blankly at the spots, completely lost in thought. He didn't even notice when Caroline emerged from the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline hugged him from the side. "What are you looking at, Honey? You seem so captivated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stammered, "You... you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline sighed, "Eloise is my adopted daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Alistair had boldly guessed this possibility, hearing Caroline confirm it with her words still shocked him deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline emphasized, "Eloise is not my biological daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't told Alistair before because the timing wasn't right. She treated Eloise as her daughter and didn't want to constantly highlight their adoptive relationship to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took Alistair a long moment to find his voice again. "Does... does Eloise know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she had been adopted as an infant, she probably wouldn't know, since she was only five years old now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to his surprise, Caroline was quiet for a moment before responding, "Yes, she knows."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Caroline adopted Eloise, she was already over two years old, a tiny, skinny little thing who shied away from everyone. She cried often and got sick easily. Caroline had spent considerable effort gaining Eloise's trust and acceptance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both of them fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After what felt like forever, Alistair broke the silence. "Why did you name her Eloise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise was eager to know what special meaning her name held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline chuckled softly, "The day I met her, it was this soft golden hour&mdash;the sun was setting, and she was crying her eyes out. The name just felt right in that moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair couldn't help but smile. He wondered if Eloise was satisfied with that answer.</span></p></div>
