        <h1>Chapter 204 Feel a Bit Uncomfortable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, thanks to his internal clock, Alistair, who had gone to bed late, woke up at his usual time. Like every other morning, he snuggled up to his wife, showered her with kisses and hugs, and </span><span>goofed around for a while before finally getting out of bed. He got dressed, brushed his teeth, washed his face, and then had breakfast with his wife. After that, one headed to the office while the other stayed busy with his own things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the filming </span><span>of "If There's a Next Second," Alistair would take some time in the morning to visit the set and check on the progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His first novel was quite short compared to those multi-million-word blockbusters in the literary world. It wrapped up at just over 300 </span><span>thousand words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, he was pouring all his energy into taking care of his family and the movie "If There's a Next Second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once things calmed down, he planned to gear up for the SAT.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People tended to crave what they didn't have. Alistair had an unwa</span><span>vering obsession with a college diploma, something that used to be within his reach but now seemed so far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he arrived at the filming location, Yves greeted him with a big smile and some great news. "Leo's agent called me early this morning.</span><span> Leo wants to compose and sing the theme song for our new movie," Yves said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled, "That's awesome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves added, "Don't get too excited just yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair guessed, saying, "Does he have some conditions we might not like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You're off the ma</span><span>rk. I mean there's even better news. Leo is doing it for free. No payment at all," Yves said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled.</span><br><span>What was Leo up to? Trying to butter him up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nah, he was just a nobody. There was no way a music prodigy like Leo would stoop so low to curry fav</span><span>or with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was clearly trying to impress little Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next time they met, Leo could brag to Eloise, "I composed and sang a song for your dad's new movie!" Eloise would be thrilled, and that would bring them closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy was really good at w</span><span>inning people over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves joked, "Alistair, you know what I dread the most? It's when people try to pull strings. Sometimes, after I've already cast the actors, someone forces me to include a total misfit with zero acting skills. It's like ruining a great m</span><span>eal with a fly. But someone like Leo? The more, the merrier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alistair's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't bother to step away from Yves. As Alistair took out his phone, Yves casually glanced at the screen and saw the name "Gordon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves twitched his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched as Alistair calmly stared at the screen for a few seconds before answering the call. Yves was more convinced than ever that this guy was something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly went back to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before calling Alistair, Gordon tried to reach Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>all he got was a polite yet cold automated message. "The number you have dialed cannot be reached at this time. Please try your call again later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Great. Just great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon was a bit frustrated. Hadn't she taken him off the blocked list yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd thought t</span><span>hat their recent encounters had gone well and that their relationship was on the mend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe she'd just forgotten to unblock him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon tried to console himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he called Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was glad he'd gotten Alistair's number last time. </span><span>Otherwise, he'd have to go through Julian every time he wanted to see his daughter. How embarrassing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was quite polite and picked up the phone quickly. "Hello, Mr. Gordon Ashbourne," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was smooth, his tone upbeat, but there was a </span><span>hint of formality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Gordon frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd started to feel a bit uncomfortable hearing Alistair address him so formally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what could he say? He'd been so rude to Alistair at the beginning. Now, asking for more respect would just make him look like a </span><span>jerk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Gordon was the type who could adapt. Despite the unease churning inside him, he managed to soften his tone and asked, "Alistair, are you guys going to Ashbourne Manor tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair replied, "We just went there yesterday, so probably </span><span>not today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd just had a get-together yesterday, and no one bothered to tell him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slammed his phone down on the office desk, then got up restlessly. He stood by the window, looking down at the bustling city below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon</span><span> had set up camp at Ashbourne Group's New York branch for the time being, choosing to stay here instead of heading back to the Atlanta headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel wasn't in good health and refused to accompany him to Atlanta. He simply couldn't leave her alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At</span><span> the same time, he saw this as an opportunity to patch things up with his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would've believed that the richest man in America had been blocked by his own flesh and blood?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole mess started when Paige had her birthday. Caroline, her niece, </span><span>didn't show up. Paige was heartbroken, and Gordon called Caroline to ask why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, it dawned on Gordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deteriorating relationship with Caroline wasn't just because he'd been too busy to spend time with her. Paige seemed to be mixed up in this som</span><span>ehow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon rubbed his temples in frustration as he sat back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about Paige made his head pound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd gradually realized that his own sister wasn't the same person she used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money couldn't fix everything. Even a billionaire like Gor</span><span>don had his own set of hidden troubles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, when he was alone, Gordon often found himself wondering.</span><br><span>What if he hadn't been so stubborn back then? What if he'd just turned a blind eye and pretended he saw nothing? What if he hadn't demanded an explanat</span><span>ion to save his so-called male pride? Maybe their family wouldn't have ended up like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon remembered how lively and adorable Caroline was as a kid. After her mother left the Ashbourne family and he rarely visited her, their father-daughter bond gre</span><span>w weaker. Eventually, Caroline treated him like a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon was lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he wondered if he'd been wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he could go back in time, would he really be able to swallow his pride and act like nothing had </span><span>happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind was in a whirl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a while, Gordon managed to calm down. What was done was done. There was no point in second-guessing or wallowing in regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned a married secretary with children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go and buy a gift for a five-year-old g</span><span>irl. I've got no clue what she likes, so you pick something suitable and get it to me before I leave the office this afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing, Mr. Gordon Ashbourne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there were no opportunities, he'd just create his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was alw</span><span>ays a way around a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he showed up at their place with a gift for his little granddaughter, would Caroline really kick him out in front of her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Gordon's face brightened with a newfound determination.</span></p></div>
