        <h1>Chapter 93 Do Whatever It Takes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suspicion instantly flashed across Rebecca's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She recalled how greedy Liam and his wife had appeared six years ago.</span><br><span>For a measly two million dollars, he was willing to sell his own son. What else wouldn't he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca let out a scornful laugh. "Liam, what's your game? I see through you. You're trying to con me into giving you more perks, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam shot back, "No way, I'm being dead-on honest. That little rascal really knows the whole deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca believed she'd seen right through his feeble attempt at pulling the wool over her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a second thought, she hung up the phone and promptly blocked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thank God Alistair takes after nobody in his father's mold. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to rest easy having him by my side for six long years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Near Stuyvesant High School, Liam was utterly exasperated, his forehead creased with annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I thought if I told Rebecca, she'd be all worked up and rush to figure things out with me, to handle Alistair. But no, she thought I was pulling her leg!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Well, at least it shows Alistair hasn't given her any grief yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam grumbled through gritted teeth, "Damn it! I've really got myself a 'wonderful' son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When he sees someone rich and powerful, he doesn't dare to mess with them. Instead, he takes it out on his own family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait! That's not right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair isn't a coward who only picks on his own. He won't let anyone off the hook; he's just going after them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam tried calling Rebecca again. "Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off. Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam was so furious that he nearly smashed his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The brief moment of relief he'd felt vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That woman is either stupid or just plain evil. She thinks Alistair won't do anything to her, so she's just sitting back and watching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If it weren't for her seeking me out all those years ago, I wouldn't be in this mess today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite his seething anger, all Liam could do was vent his frustration about Rebecca, which was utterly futile in getting him out of this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was so furious that he fantasized about going back 24 years and choking baby Alistair in his crib.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But without a time-travel device, it was nothing more than a wild dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had given him a string of bank card numbers and demanded that he deposit five million dollars into them within a week, promising to let the past be the past. What made it worse was that he hadn't even left a contact number, leaving Liam feeling cornered and desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Liam wanted to grovel for forgiveness, he had no clue where to find Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And reaching Rebecca was equally impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca looked down on them. Other than those rare phone calls, she'd always kept her whereabouts a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Alistair was the crux of the matter, tracking him down was the only hope for a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam gritted his teeth and swore, "As long as that little punk spares me, I'll do whatever it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With no other viable options, Liam made a beeline for the gates of Stuyvesant High School.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even though Alistair dropped out years ago, perhaps his former teachers could help me establish contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After badgering the school guard for a bit, Liam finally managed to get inside the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was in luck as he quickly found Emilia Clarke, the teacher who had taught Alistair. However, that was where his good fortune ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even after six years, just the mere mention of Alistair was enough to stir up a storm of indignation in Emilia. She unleashed a torrent of angry words on Liam, almost drowning him in her fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're his dad? Well, if you don't know how to get in touch with him, how do you expect me to know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What were you up to six years ago? That boy was a real genius, a sure-shot for a top-tier university. How could you just let him drop out like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't have his contact details! In all my years of teaching, I've never come across such an irresponsible parent. Your son was here at this school for ages, and you never once bothered to check on his studies. You don't even have his contact info. All we knew about was his late grandpa. We were pulling our hair out trying to find you six years ago. Did you even give a damn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a huge waste of a great kid, all because of you irresponsible parents!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam's face alternated between flushing red with embarrassment and paling in shame. He didn't dare utter a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Usually, in his suit, he looked like an important person. But in front of this enraged teacher, he cowered, looking as docile as a lamb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stammered, "Ms. Clarke, are you really sure Alistair could've gotten into a top-notch university?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is totally different from what Celeste told me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if Alistair were truly a slacker, there'd be no reason for Emilia to lie to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By now, Emilia had calmed down and realized she'd been too worked up, losing control of her emotions for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was mainly because she felt so sorry for Alistair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd just dropped out of school out of the blue. Any sensible person could tell that he must have run into some trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a pity that the boy had just left without leaving a contact. Emilia wanted to reach out and see if the school could offer any help, but there was no way to find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd even gone to the address left in the student records, only to find that he'd moved out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam left Stuyvesant High School with his tail between his legs, having been thoroughly berated by Emilia, and had nothing to show for his visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the blazing sun, his face was grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that Alistair wasn't a poor student at all. In fact, he was one of the top students in his grade!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell? Celeste told me he barely scored anything on exams. Did that old woman misread?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It doesn't matter if she's losing her marbles, but she's really screwed me over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And then there was Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I asked her about Alistair's grades back then, and she kept quiet. I thought Alistair's grades had really tanked, and there was no point in his continuing school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But then again, did Celeste really misread?</span></p></div>
