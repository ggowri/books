        <h1>Chapter 221 Don't Shut Me Out</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The house hadn't been lived in for years. A thick layer of dust covered the tile floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine was pinned to the floor, her cheek scraping against the dirty tiles, leaving her looking utterly broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone upstairs shouted, "Ms. Ashbourne, the box i</span><span>s empty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing above her, Caroline looked down with calm indifference and said to her men, "Make sure she talks. If she leaves out a single name or tries anything funny, kill her grandson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Ms. Ashbourne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flooded Lorraine's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had n</span><span>o idea how Caroline had pulled this off. The courtyard had originally been filled with their people. When had Caroline's men taken over without anyone noticing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only now that she realized she had picked the wrong person to provoke. Yet it was way to</span><span>o late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Paige, who they believed was always a step ahead of the game, clearly hadn't seen this coming. She never imagined her niece, Caroline, would be this terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Lorraine had known that one misjudgment would wipe them out entirely, she would</span><span>'ve let Paige rot in that asylum forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man upstairs called again, "Ms. Ashbourne, it's completely empty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's gaze darkened as she stared at Lorraine. "Where is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine flinched. "I</span><span>-</span><span>I don't know! Paige gave it to me years ago. I never e</span><span>ven opened it! I swear I meant to make a fair trade. I'll cooperate, I promise. I won't let anyone slip through. I'll give you every name. Just please don't hurt my grandson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated Paige with everything in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had stayed loyal and followed orders</span><span> without question, but Paige played her like a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's eyes narrowed with disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected much, though, since Paige was nothing if not calculating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her driver had been waiting outside for a while. Caroline hurried out to the </span><span>car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd already missed dinner with Alistair and Eloise. She wasn't about to miss storytime too&mdash;not when that meant curling up beside Alistair and feeling the weight of his arms around her as she fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after the car started moving, her ph</span><span>one rang. "Ms. Ashbourne, Mr. Gordon Ashbourne's men just arrived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Him?" Caroline raised an eyebrow. "If he wants to get involved, let them take over. You've all done enough. Julian will issue bonuses tonight. Take some paid time off and get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Ashbourne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ended the call. The car turned onto a wide stretch of road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline leaned back, eager to get home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the red light, her eyes dropped to the bracelet resting lightly on her wrist. Just seeing it made the ache to </span><span>return even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was Alistair doing right now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he drawing with Eloise?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching cartoons?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still wasn't home. Was he thinking about her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up ahead, she spotted a car parked on the side of the road. A tall figure stood beside it, upright and</span><span> unmistakably familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline knew it was unlikely, but she couldn't stop herself from looking again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It couldn't be... could it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline told herself she was just looking to satisfy her curiosity. Just a glance. It didn't count as a betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still ta</span><span>ngled in the guilt of being late, she let her eyes drift toward the man on the curb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she turned her eyes to the man, the headlights lit up his face and&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop the car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver slammed the brakes. The vehicle jolted to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline stared in </span><span>disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man squinted against the headlights, saw her, and then started walking over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His coat billowed in the wind, revealing a slim waist beneath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't move. Just sat there like she was frozen, her gaze locked on his every step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't a</span><span>sk. He simply opened the door on the other side and slid into the seat beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline whispered, "Honey?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd told him earlier she'd be late. But seeing him here, like this, caught her completely off guard and stirred just a hint of guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinct</span><span>ively, she reached for his arm and shook it, half-playful, half-apologetic. "Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair finally exhaled. "You weren't home. I got worried. So I came to find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reality started to click back into place, and Caroline blinked. "How did </span><span>you know where I was?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had covered her tracks so carefully. None of her people would dare leak anything&mdash;not without her direct order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So how?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did he find her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair met her gaze, completely serious. "Sweetheart, there's no place on Earth I would</span><span>n't find you. Nothing can stop a man from picking up his wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline just stared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been thinking about him, and the next moment, here he was. It felt like something out of a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out and pinched his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth, the text</span><span>ure, the unmistakable realness... Yes, he was here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips curled into a smile, soft and radiant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't ask any more questions. She didn't need to know how he did it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who cared how he found her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Eloise was right. Maybe Alistair really was bett</span><span>er than Superman. Because he would always show up when she needed him most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned into his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was still frustrated. But the arm that slipped around her waist betrayed his softness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't had the System, how would he have found her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no idea how frantic he'd been the moment she disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered the fear and the gnawing sense of helplessness&mdash;how every second without her had felt like a slow unraveling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair murmured, "You kept something from me. It's fine if </span><span>you don't want to talk about it. I respect that. But next time, I&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline straightened up. "Next time, what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair grumbled, "You know exactly what I mean."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline gave in, her tone filled with regret. "I'm sorry. I've been investigating Paige for</span><span> a while. I found out there was a group behind her. I've been trying to take them down in one shot. They're well hidden. This was the first chance I got. I couldn't let it slip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She studied his face carefully, rushing to reassure him. "Honey, I'm not reck</span><span>less. I'd never have gone if I wasn't absolutely sure it was safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Like hell I'd leave you and Eloise behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't told him because she didn't want him to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't shown up tonight, she probably never would've told him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Which was e</span><span>xactly what made him feel so powerless. Because Caroline always chose to carry things on her own. "I just want you to promise me something," he said quietly. "Whatever it is, don't shut me out. Not anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meeting his gaze, something shifted inside </span><span>her. Like she'd been quietly hypnotized. Somehow, she came to a sudden, unwavering realization&mdash;he saw through everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing she could hide from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a capable, rational adult. But just then, she found herself looking at Alistair wit</span><span>h a kind of blind, childlike awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel that he wanted her to lean on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And somehow, she knew he could carry her whole world if she let him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, she let herself believe it. She stopped overthinking and dropped the walls, the cau</span><span>tion, the fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd spent all this time trying to be the one protecting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It never even occurred to her that maybe, just maybe, she could be the one getting protected. And that giving herself to him, completely, without hesitation, could feel so safe.</span></p></div>
