        <h1>Chapter 101 Who Would've Thought</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Anne called, Rebecca pretended not to not</span><span>ice. These days, she just wasn't in the mood to talk to Anne. Chats with her only added to Rebecca's annoyance instead of soothing her troubled mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also couldn't be bothered with the text messages Anne sent later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne had a new boyfriend, and she was head over heels for him. All day long, she was like a broken record, gushing about how amazing he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Anne, he was from a humble background but had a steely determination. He'd worked his way through an overseas school, maintaining excellent grades while juggling a job. Anne made him sound like the most perfect man on the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca couldn't care less about someone else's Mr. Right. She had no interest in being an audience to Anne's romantic euphoria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, when Anne called again that evening, Rebecca initially ignored it. But when the phone rang a second time, she hesitated for a moment and then picked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had already lost Vivienne, and she didn't want to lose Anne, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd endured so many losses recently; it had been a real emotional rollercoaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was deathly afraid of ending up a lonely and forgotten soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Rebecca could even get a word in, Anne asked in a conspiratorial tone, "Rebecca, take a guess who I ran into today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca went along with it, her voice calm. "Who?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But truth be told, she couldn't have cared less at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne exclaimed, her eyes wide and her expression over-the-top, "I saw Alistair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca, who had been slouching lazily on the sofa, sat bolt upright in an instant. Her voice took on an urgent edge without her even meaning to. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alistair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne was champing at the bit to spill the beans and rambled on non-stop. Rebecca hung on to every word, not daring to miss a single syllable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She kicked herself for ignoring Anne's call during the day; it felt like she'd missed out on a goldmine of information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You should've seen him. He was decked out in a custom-made suit, and his shoes were a limited-edition one. And that car he was in... I never would've thought he had it in him. He must've snagged a rich girlfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's initial excitement started to fizzle out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truth be told, she'd had a hunch about this for some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne said, flashing a sly smile, "No wonder Vivienne was head-over-heels for him. You know, once he's all dressed up like that, he's actually quite a looker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I'm scratching my head over why Vivienne couldn't win his heart. Maybe the woman he's with now is more loaded."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca swallowed down the irritation welling up inside her and tried to sound casual as she asked, "Where'd you spot him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Near Kingswood Road. Oh, and there was a little girl with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne recalled how Alistair had sneered at her, and her teeth ground together in anger. "Getting in with a rich woman has really gone to his head. He even said my IQ was lower than a three-year-old's. It really ticked me off! If he hadn't taken off so fast, my boyfriend wouldn't have let him get away with that crap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the topic switched to her boyfriend, Anne's tone went from boastful to deeply worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She poured her heart out to Rebecca about all his problems, practically beside herself with anxiety. Anne also said she knew she had to roll up her sleeves and make more money to pull him out of his family's mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne had always nursed a dream of becoming a star. She was good-looking, but in the cut-throat world of show business, good looks alone weren't going to cut it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And her acting skills were practically non-existent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rumor had it that with her dad's help, Anne managed to meet a producer. The producer promised to give her a substantial supporting female role in the next big-budget movie helmed by a well-known director.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The "roll up her sleeves" Anne talked about meant throwing herself wholeheartedly into shooting this movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Anne mentioned above her boyfriend's surgery, Rebecca couldn't help but speak up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gently warned her, "What kind of surgery costs five million dollars? Are you sure he isn't pulling your leg?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne got irritated right away. "Rebecca, I'm beginning to think you just can't stand seeing me happy. When you were with Richard, I was always cheering you two lovebirds on. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now that you've found your happy ending and are being showered with love, why do you have to rain on my parade and ruin my mood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca took a couple of deep breaths, trying to compose herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, she managed to speak in a relatively calm tone, "Anne, I'm telling you this because you're my friend. The truth can be tough, but if you don't want to hear it, just act like I never said a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If it were Vivienne... Well, Vivienne would never be so smitten and believe everything someone tells her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca felt completely drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She regretted not being firmer and answering this call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne said petulantly, "Fine, then I'll put it like this. Even if he's really lying to me, at least he's made some effort. I don't care about the money. I'm happy to pay for what he claims to have done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, she had an urge to burst into laughter and mock Anne for being a hopeless romantic, completely smitten and blind to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then, a sense of self-awareness hit her. She quickly realized she had no grounds to laugh at Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I was just as bad as her in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A wave of melancholy washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she blurted out, "Anne, I've broken up with Richard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a mess she hadn't shared with anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne let out a surprised "Ah" and instantly forgot about their little tiff. Her eyes sparkled with the thrill of gossip. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why? You two were like a match made in heaven. And you waited for him for ages! Are you really okay with this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it because of Alistair? I knew it! Even though he's with some rich woman now, he's still sore that you didn't pick him. So he must have stirred up trouble and caused misunderstandings between you two. You can't let him get the upper hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca felt like her heart was about to shatter into pieces, and tears welled up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If only her split from Richard were due to Alistair. It would have meant that Alistair still held a torch for her, and that thought would have sent her over the moon with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But alas, Alistair had nothing to do with this breakup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was simply because, during their relationship, she'd finally seen Richard for who he really was. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And she just couldn't bear the thought of being with him any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At eight in the evening, Alistair caught sight of the additional five million dollars in his bank account and arched an eyebrow in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who would've thought that old man has such tricks up his sleeve?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd managed to scrounge up five million dollars in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed that selling his son was becoming a piece of cake for him.</span></p></div>
