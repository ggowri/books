        <h1>Chapter 9 A Quick Marriage</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She hung up without another word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair stared at his phone in disbelief. From what he knew about her, this was the calm before the storm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He placed his phone beside his pillow, muttered "psycho" under his breath, and rolled over to go back to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as he closed his eyes, something occurred to him. He quickly grabbed his phone again and blocked Rebecca's number. Only then did he close his eyes with a sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Let someone else deal with that bad-tempered princess. He was done with her nonsense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca sat on the sofa with her arms crossed and fury written all over her face. Having issued her ten-minute ultimatum, she began a silent countdown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One minute passed. Then two, and three...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By the seven-minute mark, Rebecca was pacing impatiently around the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At eight minutes, she kicked over a chair in frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By nine minutes, Rebecca's anger turned to harsh laughter.<br>Well, well, Alistair. Nine minutes have passed and you're still not here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ten minutes passed without any sign of Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca couldn't believe he'd dare challenge her authority like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fuming, she called him again. For the first time ever, she heard the automated message. "Sorry, the number you are calling is unavailable..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her first thought was that Vivienne must have already reached out to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How pathetic was Vivienne that she needed to pick up my cast-offs?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The idea of Alistair and Vivienne chatting away, possibly hooking up behind her back, drove Rebecca crazy. She kept calling him obsessively, but by the tenth attempt, reality finally hit her&mdash;Alistair had blocked her number!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Alistair's attempt to catch up on sleep wasn't going any better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Another ringtone soon woke him up. He naturally assumed it was the mentally unstable Rebecca calling from another number to yell at him after discovering she'd been blocked. He was fed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is ridiculous. We're done with each other now. Why should I keep putting up with her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair answered the phone with obvious irritation. "What?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The caller seemed startled by his tone and responded timidly, "Hello, Alistair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The voice on the phone wasn't Rebecca's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who is this?" Alistair asked, confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's Vivienne," she replied with a light laugh. "We've met before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair immediately placed her. Vivienne was one of Rebecca's best friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca had two close friends&mdash;Anne and Vivienne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anne was... Well, he didn't really want to talk about her. But Vivienne was different. She was cut from a completely different cloth than Rebecca and Anne. Actually, she had decent values. Alistair still remembered how she'd come to his defense once when Rebecca was giving him a hard time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Can I help you with something?" he asked cautiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she was calling about Rebecca, he'd hang up immediately and block her number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It occurred to Alistair that if he really wanted to cut ties with Rebecca completely, he should change his phone number. He'd do that first thing after getting out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well," Vivienne said, sounding a bit embarrassed, "I was hoping you could do me a favor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What kind of favor?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nothing could have prepared Alistair for her request&mdash;she wanted him to come over and cook a meal at her place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As it turned out, her mother, Miranda Everett, had undergone surgery to remove uterine fibroids. During a visit, Rebecca had brought some chicken noodle soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Miranda, who'd had no appetite since the surgery, suddenly found herself hungry again. She couldn't stop talking about it afterward, claiming it was the best chicken noodle soup she'd ever tasted and that it reminded her of childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, it was actually Alistair who made that soup himself. Though Miranda couldn't stop thinking about it, she felt too awkward to ask for it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tomorrow was Miranda's birthday, and Vivienne suddenly thought of that chicken noodle soup while brainstorming unique gift ideas. Worried he might refuse, she quickly added, "Don't worry, I wouldn't expect you to do this for nothing. I'll pay you. How about 100 thousand dollars to make one dinner?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As a wealthy heiress, Vivienne didn't think twice about spending 100 thousand dollars just so her mom could taste that soup she'd been craving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Getting paid that much for cooking one meal was clearly a sweet deal for Alistair, though money wasn't exactly tight for him these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since becoming the female CEO's kept man, his monthly allowance had reached one million dollars. To put it bluntly, even if he wanted to be poor again, he probably couldn't manage it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">During his six years with Rebecca, the only skill he'd truly developed was his increasingly impressive cooking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair considered the request carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If anyone else had asked, he would have flat-out refused. But this was Vivienne, someone who had shown him kindness and even defended him when Rebecca had given him a hard time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wasn't the type to leave debts unpaid. Besides, her request wasn't unreasonable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Your ex-wife's best friend has made a request. How will you respond?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Option one: She's Rebecca's friend. To avoid unnecessary complications, make up an excuse and decline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Option two: Rebecca is Rebecca, and Vivienne is Vivienne. You won't deliberately distance yourself from someone who means you no harm just because you're keeping your distance from Rebecca.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Choose option one for 50 system credits. Choose option two for 50 system credits."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For once, the system had set up equally balanced options.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm sorry, but I need to think about this," Alistair said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Vivienne was just grateful he hadn't immediately turned her down. "No problem!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How many people will be attending the birthday party?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If there were too many guests, it would put Alistair in an awkward position. He worried about handling everything alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn't about the money. He'd already written off the 100 thousand dollars. He'd only agreed to help as a favor to repay an old debt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Vivienne sighed with relief, "Don't worry, it's just family. About ten people or so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair hesitated before asking, "Will Rebecca be there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Vivienne paused and then understood. He didn't want to see Rebecca.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Rebecca's temper, it was no surprise she'd give Alistair the cold shoulder. His hesitation made perfect sense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"My mother doesn't like big gatherings," she explained. "We always keep birthdays to family only, no outsiders."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair agreed without hesitation, "Fine by me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thanks so much," Vivienne said gratefully. "See you tomorrow then!"</p></div>
