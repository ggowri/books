        <h1>Chapter 89 I Met Your Ex-wife</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What if you want to go back on your word later? I won't agree." After a pause, Alistair suddenly realized that it was rather overconfident of him to say such words to Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Caroline didn't want him anymore, she had a thousand ways to make him disappear from her sight immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair understood the cruel gap between them. He felt a little depressed for a while and then continued in a tone almost like a child's pettishness, "Even if you drive me away then, I won't leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's eyes lit up suddenly. Only a fool would drive him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought that it should be Alistair who was worried about the possibility of her wanting to abandon him. If that happened, she would really tie him up with a rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Caroline wouldn't tell Alistair this, for fear that he would be scared by her brutal side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he stayed by her side obediently, she could guarantee that she would never show her brutal side to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline looked up and said, "Honey, I want to spend the rest of my life with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meeting her gentle eyes, Alistair's heart melted like water, and he unconsciously responded, "Okay, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's heart trembled. She thought he was so gentle and felt an even stronger urge to kiss him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Caroline was thinking this, she found Alistair's face getting closer and closer. She instinctively held her breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Caroline thought Alistair was gentle, in Alistair's eyes, she was like a tempting fruit on a branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under some kind of bewitchment, he instinctively lowered his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Caroline felt Alistair's breath on her face, despite being a woman worth tens of billions of dollars, she held her breath and nervously closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as Alistair's lips were about to land on her delicate and glistening lips, Caroline turned her head and dodged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was stunned for a moment, and his mind, clouded by lust, went completely blank.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What am I doing? I shouldn't have been so hasty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they had a meeting of minds and reached a consensus to be a real couple, just because he was ready didn't mean Caroline was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sick. I don't want to infect you with the virus." Caroline shyly buried her face in Alistair's chest. Afraid that Alistair would think too much, her voice involuntarily carried a hint of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair let out a long sigh of relief, and his heart, which had stopped for a moment, began to work again. He had thought that his eagerness had made her feel disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was a reasonable need for him to have intimate contact with her now, since they had always kept their distance before, it wasn't appropriate to suddenly get closer without some transition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was reluctant to let go of her. After holding her for a while, he turned around to pour her a glass of water. Besides taking medicine on time and getting enough rest, drinking plenty of warm water properly would help Caroline get better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline held the water cup with both hands. Seeing that Alistair was sitting opposite her, she wasn't satisfied. So she stood up and, under Alistair's puzzled gaze, sat down closely beside him and gently rested her head on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just wanted to stick to Alistair all the time, especially after knowing who Alistair was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this posture, she drank a full glass of warm water in small sips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amazingly, the water, which originally had no taste, actually tasted sweet when it entered her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Alistair recalled that he had accidentally drunk the water with medicine from her cup in the morning. If he was really going to be infected, he should have been infected already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the support of "Robustness", the virus shouldn't be able to defeat him. But he somehow felt a sense of regret, as if he had missed something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, I met your ex-wife today. Rebecca, right?" Caroline said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline didn't hide it from Alistair. Even if she didn't say it, Eloise might say it. Eloise shared everything with Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alistair heard that Eloise had been bullied by Daniel in kindergarten, he angrily pounded the sofa and said, "That little punk actually dared to bully Eloise. I have to teach him a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that Eloise had been pushed down, Alistair asked nervously, "Did Eloise get hurt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He treated Eloise as his own daughter. No matter who bullied Eloise, he was determined to show that person who was in charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he understood why Caroline had left in a hurry. At that time, Alistair had been in a daze because of the shock of their transformation from a contractual couple to a real one and hadn't noticed Caroline's abnormality at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline shook her head and said, "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair said, "Why didn't you tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to give Daniel a good beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline joked, "His mother was also there. I was afraid that you would rekindle your old feelings with your ex-wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I slapped her twice. You won't feel sorry for her, will you?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair felt a bit speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I slapped her once on your behalf because she used to bully you just because she had money. And I slapped her again for Eloise because she didn't discipline her son well and let him bully Eloise," Caroline said.</span></p></div>
