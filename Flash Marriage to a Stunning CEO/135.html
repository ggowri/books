        <h1>Chapter 135 Daddy's Little Sweetheart</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either Alista</span><span>ir's memory was playing tricks on him or the weather really was getting hotter. By late April, temperatures had soared to 90&deg;F, making long sleeves impossible to wear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was definitely time for Eloise to break out her pretty dresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair never had to</span><span> worry about clothes. They were delivered regularly, all designer brands and custom pieces he couldn't possibly wear through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline clearly didn't expect him to wear every single item. She just loved taking care of every detail for her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankful</span><span>ly, Alistair hated shopping, or he would have robbed her of that simple pleasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Caroline took a different approach with Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that their daughter was growing up, they needed to respect her own taste and preferences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When buying clothes for </span><span>Eloise, they let her choose what she liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise had grown taller, and none of her cute dresses fit anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When picking her up from school, Alistair noticed some of the other kids wearing pretty dresses. "Eloise, would you like to wear dresses </span><span>too?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise nodded, swaying her head playfully. "How can a princess not have princess dresses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair burst out laughing, "You're absolutely right! Come on, let's go buy you some new dresses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise jumped up and down with excitement. "Dad, </span><span>you're the best! You're the greatest dad in the whole world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">See how easy kids are to please?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, having survived five years with Daniel, Alistair knew not all children were this sweet and innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Eloise was the absolute cutest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As th</span><span>ey walked hand in hand, Eloise bounced along beside him, her pigtails bobbing up and down with each happy skip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young shop assistant greeted them with a warm smile. "Welcome to our store." Her eyes landed on Alistair and lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hot damn, what a gorgeo</span><span style="font-style: italic;">us guy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too bad she was working&mdash;no chance to ask for his number. Then, her gaze dropped to the little girl, and her heart melted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What an adorable little cutie! If only I had a daughter this precious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her professional smile, her mind was racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Are</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> they brother and sister? They are just too cute together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't mind one bit if her mom decided to have another baby, especially if she got a sister as pretty and sweet as Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as that thought crossed her mind, Eloise looked up with the swe</span><span>etest voice imaginable. "Daddy, which dress do you think looks prettier on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant froze, her inexperienced face unable to hide her shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A hot guy who looks my age is actually a little girl's dad?! No wonder I've barely seen any gorgeous men i</span><span style="font-style: italic;">n my twenty-something years. All the good ones get snatched up early! So unfair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair knew exactly what to say. "You're beautiful. You look great in everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise grinned from ear to ear, mimicking his answer. "You're handsome too, Daddy. You loo</span><span>k good in everything you wear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't have a humble bone in his body. "Well, of course I do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise acted like a little grown-up as she browsed through the clothing racks with Alistair following behind, offering his opinions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This one's pretty.</span><span>.. that one's nice too... oh, and I really like that one over there," Eloise muttered, overwhelmed by all the cute options in the children's store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair shrugged. "If you like them, let's get them all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone with deep pockets like him, buying ev</span><span>ery pretty dress in the store to make his daughter happy was as casual as breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise finally picked out two dresses, but Alistair wasn't satisfied. "Just two? Grab a few more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise shook her head. "No need, Daddy. Two is plenty for me. I know </span><span>how hard you and Mommy work for your money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's heart melted at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For that sweet comment alone, he'd happily buy every princess dress in New York if she wanted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After paying, he led Eloise out of the children's boutique, thinking about wha</span><span>t treat he could get her next. Just then, his phone vibrated in his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked the caller ID, and his expression tightened. After listening to the person on the other end for a few moments, he replied with a terse "I understand," and ended the call</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair knelt down to Eloise's level with a smile. "Eloise, I have to take care of something. Would you mind going to great-grandma's for now? Mom and I will come get you as soon as I'm done, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, Daddy. Go do your work," Eloise replied obedien</span><span>tly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the car carrying Eloise had driven away, Alistair's face darkened as he put the phone back to his ear. "Where is he now?" he demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The caller was one of the bodyguards assigned to protect his family. The guard had just informed him that a </span><span>suspicious person had been following them from the kindergarten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard had taken photos of the man and sent them to Alistair to see if he recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair identified him immediately. It was Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heartbroken and unemployed, he stood there </span><span>in plain jeans and a white button-up. All the life had been drained from him&mdash;no trace of his former confidence remained. His unshaven face and disheveled appearance made him look like a stray dog that people crossed the street to avoid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the intersection</span><span>, Caleb scanned the crowds desperately, trying to spot Alistair and Eloise again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd followed them all the way from Eloise Academy without any problems until someone bumped into him. When he looked back up, they were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swore under his breath. So h</span><span>e'd lost them today&mdash;fine. There was always tomorrow. "I'm not giving up that easily, Alistair," he muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking for someone? Me, perhaps?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mocking voice behind him made Caleb nearly jump out of his skin. He spun around to find Alistair</span><span> standing there with an amused half-smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bustling intersection, Alistair cut a striking figure in his perfectly tailored suit. His calm, confident smile and relaxed posture formed a stark contrast to Caleb's disheveled state. Something about Alist</span><span>air's commanding presence made Caleb instinctively step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crossed Alistair's face. "You wanted something from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was furious with himself for showing weakness in front of Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's there to be afraid of? He's just some gold-</span><span style="font-style: italic;">digging loser who got lucky with a rich woman. If he hadn't married into money, he'd be nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb shot him a cold smile. "Drop the act. You think I can't tell how smug you are right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair clicked his tongue. "Caleb, I'm seriously worried abou</span><span>t you. I'm not just feeling smug. I'm absolutely gloating right now. Are you blind? How can you not see that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was speechless. He glared at Alistair, rage and helplessness written all over his face. "Our family is ruined because of you. Happy now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Please," Alistair scoffed. "You guys did this to yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb's jaw tightened. "You'll get what's coming to you!"</span></p></div>
