        <h1>Chapter 183 Clearing the Cancer Cells</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's heart lurched. What the hell kind of thing was that to say?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't ever say that again," he said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline, unusually forceful in front of him, snapped back, "Well, that's how I feel. If anything ever happens to you, I won't live through it either."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He softened his tone, caught between tenderness and helplessness. "Don't be silly. I'm fine. Things are just starting to look up for me, and I'm nowhere near done. How could I ever leave you and Eloise behind? I want to grow old with you, watch Eloise grow up."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a long breath. "And I mean it. Don't say things like that again. You've got Eloise to think about. You've got Grandma, and everyone else who cares about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear his reminder had tugged at the part of her that still carried responsibilities beyond just him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair felt a pang of guilt. This was on him. He'd worried her sick.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this wasn't the time for the two of them to collapse into each other, crying over who hurt more.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slipped an arm around Caroline and steered her toward the car. "Is Grandma still here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She didn't leave," Caroline said, shaking her head. "She's at Ashbourne Manor. But, honey... you're going to see her now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly misunderstood. Lowering her voice, she said, "Gordon didn't tell her anything. You spent the whole night locked up. You must be exhausted. Let's go home first. Take a shower, get some rest. I'll ask the chef to make your favorites, something nice to welcome you back. If you still want to visit Grandma, we can all go together later this afternoon with Eloise."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she gently cupped his face, her brows drawing together in distress. "You've lost weight."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair let out a dry laugh. It had only been one night. How much weight could he possibly have lost? He probably just looked drained. Or maybe it was all in her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he realized Mabel was still in New York, Alistair let out a silent sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon hadn't given him a definite answer yesterday when he was taken away, but he hadn't flat-out refused either.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somewhere deep down, Alistair had felt sure Gordon wouldn't say no. Maybe it was because of Caroline. Maybe it was something else. Either way, it didn't matter. Mabel was still here. That was all that counted.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entire body relaxed. As he glanced down at Caroline, he finally took in the signs&mdash;her complexion pale, lips bloodless, faint shadows under her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't get much sleep, did you?" he murmured, lightly brushing her cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hummed in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Much sleep? She hadn't slept at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been worried sick, but in front of Eloise, she hadn't dared show even a crack. Alistair had been taken away so abruptly, and Eloise had sensed something was off. She kept asking questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked before bed. She asked again the moment she woke up. If she hadn't trusted Caroline so much, it would've been impossible to get through the night without breaking down.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they got in the car, Alistair suggested, "Let's go see Grandma now. We can have lunch there too. I owe her an apology for leaving without a word yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded like a suggestion, but really, it wasn't up for discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything they'd just been through&mdash;an entire night of mental and physical torment&mdash;nothing mattered more to Caroline than having Alistair back by her side, whole and unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even think twice. Whatever he wanted, she'd do it, as long as it was within her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded gently. "Alright. Whatever you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car glided smoothly along the overpass.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One vehicle after another zoomed past, engines roaring as they left them in the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their driver wasn't in a rush. Safety came first.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was never the impatient type, but right now he couldn't help it. He wished he could sprout wings and fly straight to Ashbourne Manor or tear open space itself and just blink himself there.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had only been a day. The system item "No Cancer" still had six days left before it expired.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Technically, there was no need to rush. But this wasn't just any matter. Every extra hour that passed without clearing Mabel's cancer meant more pain&mdash;physical and emotional&mdash;for her to endure in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still at Ashbourne Manor, yes. But Alistair wasn't taking any chances. The sooner he could cure her, the sooner he could breathe again.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect trouble, but trouble had arrived anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they got out of the car, they spotted an ambulance parked in the courtyard. Their hearts both jumped.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp pulse of dread shot through Alistair.</span><br><span>Am I too late?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaxon had just told him yesterday that Mabel had at least six months left. There was no way it could've worsened so fast...</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had only been one night. If he'd known&mdash;if he'd known it would come to this&mdash;he would've used the system right then and there, even if it meant being accused of trying to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline rushed to a maid, panic written all over her face. "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this house, Mabel was the oldest and most frail. If an ambulance had come, chances were it was for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd just been in the hospital not long ago. Now this?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambulances showing up this often at Ashbourne Manor... it sent a very loud message.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid choked on her words. "Madam Ashbourne fainted again this morning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline didn't wait for her to finish. She bolted toward the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sprinted after her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, a team of medics in masks and scrubs came rushing out, a gurney rolling fast between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline broke down. "Grandma! Grandma!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time Mabel fainted, they hadn't been there to see it. But now, seeing her with their own eyes&mdash;eyes shut tight, lying pale and still on that stretcher&mdash;was gut-wrenching.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair darted forward and, in the chaos, quickly grasped Mabel's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, he heard the system chime in his mind.</span><br><span>"'No Cancer' activated. Patient's cancer cells are now being cleared."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That robotic voice, clear and mechanical, sounded more beautiful than it had the day he first bonded with the system.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair finally exhaled.</span><br><span>She's going to be alright.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really said that in front of her?" Gordon's roar practically shook the ceiling. "You know she can't take emotional shocks, and you still went on and on like that? Don't act like it wasn't deliberate! Last time she collapsed, it was because you couldn't keep your mouth shut either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was telling the truth," the other person fired back. "I just wanted Mabel to have the full picture. Why is that so wrong? If your daughter hadn't married that lowlife, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your mouth. Who the hell are you calling a lowlife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gordon, Mom might be losing her mind, but what's your excuse? Are you seriously considering welcoming a murderer into this family? Let's see if he even makes it out of the precinct this time!"</span></p></div>
