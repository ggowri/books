        <h1>Chapter 222 Nothing Left Unsaid</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, where's Eloise? With Grandma?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was building a snowman with her. Then Leo came by, so I asked him to help look after her. He's been staying at </span><span>Ashbourne</span><span> Manor lately, so I'm guessing he took her </span><span>back there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline paused for a long moment before speaking softly, "My father got involved in the matter. As long as the result is what I wanted, I don't care who takes over. I handed it off to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she wanted was for Paige to be locked up in tha</span><span>t psychiatric hospital for the rest of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair let out a quiet sigh. "Don't do that again. I was really worried."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline responded with a soft, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The streetlights along both sides of the road began to glow one by one, winding ahead like </span><span>a necklace strung with dazzling pearls by a giant hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave Leo a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was right. Eloise had indeed been taken to Mabel by Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline turned and wrapped her arms around his arm, resting her chin on his shoulder. "Let her stay at </span><span>Ashbourne</span><span> </span><span>Manor tonight. We can bring her home tomorrow evening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Saturday tomorrow. Eloise didn't have school, and Caroline was clearly giving her and Leo a chance to bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair couldn't help but feel moved. His outwardly cold but inwardly tender wife mi</span><span>ght appear indifferent toward Leo, but deep down, she did care about her cousin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, there had never been any real animosity between Caroline and Leo. Their strained relationship had always been Paige's doing. Now that she was no longer there to</span><span> sow discord, the tension between them seemed to melt away like a spring breeze sweeping across a frozen lake. The change was visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think that's a good idea," Alistair said with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roads were unexpectedly clear, and they arrived thirty minute</span><span>s earlier than Caroline had expected. It was only ten thirty when they got home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they stepped inside, Caroline instinctively leaned into Alistair's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed a moment to recharge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They held each other close for a while, cheek to cheek.</span><span> Then Caroline murmured, "Honey, I actually knew you a long time ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is she finally ready to tell me everything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline wrapped her arms around his neck, her voice laced with guilt. "I never dared to tell you before. I </span><span>was afraid it would change how you saw me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gazed at her tenderly. "How could it ever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had made up her mind. She wasn't going to keep it from him anymore. "We used to be neighbors. Bet you didn't see that coming, right? You never </span><span>noticed me, but I used to see you almost every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, of course, already knew. He had known everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hearing Caroline tell the story herself carried a weight no one else could understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their thoughts drifted to twelve years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw h</span><span>er today," Caroline said quietly. "She called me trash&mdash;filthy, worthless, and too stubborn to take a hint."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had sat at the window in a daze, staring blankly outside, and that was when she saw the boy standing there&mdash;looking up, smiling at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So </span><span style="font-style: italic;">even something as ugly and unwanted as me... didn't make him look away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, she began to observe the boy next door&mdash;casually at first and then more deliberately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she wasn't discreet enough. He noticed her quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lifted his head, </span><span>flashin</span><span>g</span><span> that clean, handsome smile, and waved at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't dared to wave back. Back then, she had thought she was too broken, too hideous to be seen by anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If he really saw me, he'd probably be terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, the stagnant pool of emotions insid</span><span>e her had finally started to ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid he'd be annoyed by her presence. She was afraid that the next time he looked up at her window, his eyes would be filled with disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it turned out she had been wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he never tried to talk </span><span>to her again, she could feel it in the way he moved and acted&mdash;he was being considerate of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had started spending more time outside, clearly on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His house was a plain, slightly worn two-story building. He used to live downstairs with his grand</span><span>father but later moved upstairs. And when he was home, unless it was nighttime, his curtains were always open, the windows wide, showing his room to the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might have seemed meaningless to others, but to her, it was clear&mdash;this was his way of being t</span><span>here for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair felt a wave of emotion swell in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline was incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had actually picked up on what he had been trying to do back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was right. When he realized someone was watching him, he hadn't been creeped out. On the c</span><span>ontrary, with a heart still untouched by the cruelty of the world, he had tried his best to offer her a tiny spark of joy&mdash;just by existing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Caroline whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The memories stirred up a deep, relentless tide in Alistair's heart. He cupped her </span><span>face, unable to hold back any longer. "Sweetheart, I have something for you. I was planning to give it to you on your birthday, but I just can't wait. Christmas is coming, so let's call it an early Christmas gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's eyes lit up. "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ali</span><span>stair gave her a mischievous smile. "That's a secret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed his hands gently on her shoulders and guided her to sit down on the couch. Then he turned and walked into the storage room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before stepping out again, he made a request. "Close your eyes, swe</span><span>etheart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He returned to the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline sat upright, her back perfectly straight, hands resting primly on her lap. She looked more proper than a schoolgirl waiting for roll call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair tiptoed up to her and couldn't resist </span><span>leaning in to kiss her lightly on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline didn't open her eyes, but a smile tugged at her lips. "Is that my gift? Well, it's a little lazy, but I still like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair chuckled, the warmth of his breath brushing her skin. "Don't </span><span>underestimate me. My gifts are never half-hearted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt his presence draw back and grew anxious. "Can I open my eyes now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just one more second... okay, now you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline slowly opened her eyes. The first thing she saw was Alistair's glowing, ea</span><span>ger smile. Her gaze dropped and then froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair spoke gently, "Open it and see if you like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline stared at him in shock, as if trying to confirm something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her a look of encouragement. She leaned forward, slowly reached for th</span><span>e item on the table, and placed her hand on the wooden box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one firm push, she opened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat there, stunned, staring at the neatly arranged contents. Tears fell without warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't bother wiping them away. Her hands t</span><span>rembled as she picked up the topmost item&mdash;a photo album. Inside were pictures of her from infancy up to the age of twelve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silently, she set the album aside and picked up a notebook. The first page greeted her with a line in a familiar, delicate hand: [To </span><span>my dearest Caroline, my precious girl.]</span></p></div>
