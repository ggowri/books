        <h1>Chapter 69 Time Snapshot</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair hadn't come </span><span>unprepared. He wouldn't have shown up to stir things up without being absolutely certain of his position.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam believed that since the incident happened six years ago, even if Alistair discovered the truth, they could just deny everything and pretend nothi</span><span>ng happened if they stuck to their story. He was confident Alistair couldn't find any evidence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, when Rebecca transferred the money to them back then, the clever Liam and Celeste had insisted on making it look "perfectly legitimate".</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't worr</span><span>ied even if Rebecca turned against them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was the mastermind, though. Whether she'd acted out of a spoiled desire to be with Alistair or for some other unknown reason, she had nothing to gain if the truth came out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for how Alistair found </span><span>out...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To get Alistair on board quickly, they painted this dramatic worst-case scenario. They were banking on him not looking too closely at the details, which honestly didn't add up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vehicular manslaughter charge typically carried a maximum sentence of </span><span>three years, not to mention that insurance companies handle accident compensation, not individuals.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The timing was also suspicious. Rebecca had approached Liam immediately after he "hit someone". Once Alistair grew up and developed some critical thinking s</span><span>kills, he naturally started questioning the whole situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam and Celeste were bold enough to lie so blatantly because they weren't worried about eventually being exposed. Deep down, they believed their son was obedient and timid, a pushover who wouldn</span><span>'t question them. They were confident that with their silver tongues, they could explain away any inconsistencies.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they never anticipated was that Alistair would uncover the truth about something that happened six years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The System Store offered a</span><span> bizarre collection of items you'd never find in real life, things that seemed almost magical in their capabilities.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was the "Secret Obliterator", perfect for dealing with sworn enemies, and the incredible "No Cancer" that could apparently work mirac</span><span>les.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that the more outlandish and powerful an item sounded, the higher its price tag.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The system existed to guide Alistair toward making the right life choices, helping his journey run smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided against buying the "Secret Obliterator"</span><span> since it could only target one person, and those who had screwed him over weren't just Liam and Rebecca. Celeste had definitely been involved too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weighing his options, Alistair chose a different item called "Time Snapshot".</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This allowed past events</span><span> to replay before his eyes, provided they had actually happened and he could specify when they occurred and who was involved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alistair suspected Rebecca had met with Liam, he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, which created some risk.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she'd contac</span><span>ted Liam by phone or through someone else, the Time Snapshot might not work at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being forgiving sometimes depended on the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Alistair's life, and if he couldn't stand up for himself and demand justice, that would be selling himself sho</span><span>rt. He absolutely wouldn't let this matter drop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone involved would pay the price.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair hesitated for just a moment before deciding to trust his judgment. Thankfully, it worked!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the footage, Rebecca looked nearly as pale as when she'd found him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he'd initially suspected, she had gone alone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An unmarried pregnancy was scandalous enough, and with her hidden agenda, she clearly wanted as few people involved as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam looked her up and down, noting her expensive clothes that suggeste</span><span>d she came from money. Despite his confusion, his tone remained respectful. "Can I help you, young lady?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's expression was cold, but Alistair recognized that familiar arrogance in her demeanor. "Yes. Are you Alistair's father, Liam?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I'm his classmate," she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Liam looked surprised before something seemed to click in his mind. He immediately became anxious. "Did that punk do something to you? Don't worry. When he gets home, I'll teach him a lesson he won't forget!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reb</span><span>ecca fell silent for a moment, clearly caught off guard that Liam had assumed Alistair was at fault before even hearing what happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him with a flash of contempt in her eyes. How could she not realize he'd only jumped to conclusions after s</span><span>eeing her expensive clothes? He knew she was someone not to be messed with, so he immediately took her side to avoid trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Rebecca's own parents had condemned her based on someone else's word, she would have been heartbroken and would have </span><span>raised hell until justice was served.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca cut straight to the point. "I want your son to drop out of school and be with me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam froze, clearly caught off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca didn't waste time with small talk. "I can give you a million dollars if you agree</span><span> to stay out of his business," she said bluntly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of money, Liam's eyes lit up immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had a shred of common sense, though. "But... what about his SAT? Wouldn't this affect his studies?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, Celeste burst int</span><span>o the room and launched into a tirade. "What studies? His grades are absolute garbage! He scores 20 or 30 points on tests worth 150! Keeping him in school would just be embarrassing for everyone!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That can't be right," Liam said, confused. "My dad </span><span>told me Alistair's grades were good and he'd have no problem getting into university."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste let out a scornful laugh. "Is there anything about Alistair that Robert didn't think was perfect? He just said that because he thought Caleb was too brilliant, a</span><span>nd he was afraid his precious grandson would look bad in comparison!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw Alistair's test papers when he was here last. He really did score 20 points. I can't remember if it was physics or something else. Caleb says with grades like that, he couldn't eve</span><span>n graduate from high school!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam turned to Rebecca. "Is it true his grades are that bad? If so, there's really no point in him continuing school."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca remained silent, which Liam took as confirmation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid he might still be hesitating, Celeste push</span><span>ed harder. "Let me make one thing clear. Now that Robert is gone, there's nobody to pay your useless son's tuition. He won't qualify for public school, and I certainly don't have money to send him to a private one!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Rebecca, then pulled Liam</span><span> aside. "This girl is pretty and loaded. It's your son's good fortune if she's interested in him. You'd be better off letting him be with her. Caleb has a classmate who's going abroad, and he's been thinking about doing the same..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam wavered almost imm</span><span>ediately after Celeste started talking. She then stepped in and pushed the price up to two million dollars, which Rebecca agreed to without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Rebecca left, Celeste spent half the day beating herself up about it. She was more upset than if sh</span><span>e'd lost 100 million dollars. "I was just testing the waters. I didn't think she'd actually say yes," she groaned. "If I'd known, I would've asked for five million dollars instead..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair watched the footage of how he'd been sold to Rebecca years ago </span><span>with an eerily calm demeanor.</span></p></div>
