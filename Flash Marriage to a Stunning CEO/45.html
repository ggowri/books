        <h1>Chapter 45 Carol's Family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more she convinced herself, the more certain she became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regret swelled like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She leaned back against the seat, eyes fluttering shut, and the memories flooded in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rebecca, dinner's ready. Want me to wake you up now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I ironed your clothes. They're hanging in the closet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I already sent gifts to your parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Danny's not feeling great. I'm taking him to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simple, ordinary moments she'd once ignored&mdash;maybe even found annoying&mdash;now shimmered in her mind like the purest, rarest kind of love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Last night was a mistake. I was drunk. It didn't mean anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget me. Forget everything between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I love you. I miss you so much it's killing me. Let's go home and get married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you really that blind, Rebecca? Your parents don't even treat you like their daughter anymore. Can't you see it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm giving you one last chance. If you keep acting like this, I'm gone. For good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard's voice crashed into the memories, ruining everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She clenched her fists, trying to shake him from her mind&mdash;but he stuck like glue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked around. The scent in the car was his cologne. The seat was adjusted to his height. The mini fridge was stocked with his drinks. His tie and blazer were thrown casually in the back. Even the playlist was his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She used to crave his presence so much that she'd cover her bedroom with his photos, sleeping with his shirts just to feel close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, it all made her nauseous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air felt heavy and suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without thinking, she rolled down the window and started tossing everything out&mdash;his tie, his jacket, even the car's air freshener.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she remembered&mdash;he'd been driving this car for days. The driver's seat was his. She reached for the seat cover, about to rip it off&mdash;</span><br><span>A knock on the window startled her. A security guard held up the discarded items, frowning, "Miss, please don't litter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Ashbourne Manor, Alistair's second visit felt more like coming home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alistair, there you are." Mabel beamed. "Come in, sit down! Lila made fresh pastries&mdash;they're still warm!" She spoke to him as if he'd grown up at her side like Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair sat down obediently, taking a bite. Soft, chewy, and just sweet enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel's eyes twinkled. "Is it good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded. "Delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll have Lila make more this afternoon. Bring some back for Caroline and Eloise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She chuckled and then added, "Caroline's picky. Doesn't really care for sweets. Thankfully, Eloise doesn't take after her. That little girl loves them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caroline's picky? Really? That's news to me. She told me she wasn't picky about food at all...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel had invited Alistair over today not just to spend more time with him but&mdash;clearly&mdash;for Caroline's sake.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before getting into that, though, she gave him a brief and sharp rundown of what had happened with Agnes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alban brought Agnes back, she actually assumed Mabel wanted to rehire her, thinking maybe Mabel hadn't taken to the new staff. She even hinted at a raise, bold as brass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she saw Mabel standing there&mdash;alive, well, and clearly not buying her act&mdash;and the whole truth came crashing down. Agnes realized Preston's plan had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel had spent years cultivating a warm, kind image. But the steel underneath had never gone dull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under that calm pressure, Agnes cracked. She confessed everything&mdash;her collusion with Preston, every sneaky move, every lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And then, unbelievably, she tried to blame it all on Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said she'd always been loyal to the Ashbourne family, that it was Caroline's cold-hearted decision to fire her sister that pushed her into Preston's arms, and that none of it would've happened otherwise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel just pulled out proof showing that Agnes had already started working with Preston before her sister was ever let go. That shut her up real fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Mabel wasn't the kind to let someone off lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially someone who'd whispered poison into Eloise's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Mabel was no tyrant. She didn't abuse her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, she found proof that Agnes had been skimming off the top for years&mdash;misusing her position to take "small advantages," which, added up, amounted to a prosecutable offense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't petty theft and was enough to send her to jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Preston? Mabel didn't care that he came from money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His little stunt was dangerously close to attempted murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She compiled every piece of evidence and had it sent directly to the Vaughn family, along with a message&mdash;if they didn't handle this themselves, she would.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ashbourne name carried weight&mdash;not just in New York, but across the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they wanted, they could take down the Vaughns without lifting more than a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one in their right mind would willingly go up against the Ashbournes, especially when they were clearly in the wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hence, their patriarch showed up in person, pale and trembling, dragging Preston along like a sacrificial lamb. By that same night, Preston had been put on a plane and shipped out of the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When&mdash;or if&mdash;he returned would be entirely up to the Ashbournes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that, as Mabel said, was the end of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had always known the Ashbournes were powerful, but today, he realized just how far that influence stretched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did I accidentally attach myself to a juggernaut?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then Mabel turned serious. "Alistair, has Carol ever told you about her family&mdash;aside from me?" </p></div>
