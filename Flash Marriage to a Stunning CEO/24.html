        <h1>Chapter 24 I Divorced Him</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These past few days, Alistair's phone had been flooded with calls from unfamiliar numbers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn't answer a single one. Only after changing to a new number did he finally regain peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Growing increasingly suspicious, Cordelia reluctantly decided to call Alistair herself&mdash;only to find the number disconnected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Refusing to let it go, she pressed Rebecca for answers. Rebecca simply confessed, "I divorced him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What?" Cordelia was thunderstruck. "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why else?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Of course, it's because my first love came back. Alistair, now superfluous, had to step aside to make room for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca didn't explain. Instead, she clutched a pillow over her head and cried out in distress, "Mom, can you just stop asking? Since you never liked him, isn't this divorce exactly what you and Dad wanted? I can find a better husband&mdash;isn't that enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Rebecca's emotional state, Cordelia assumed she was traumatized by the divorce and didn't dare push further. She immediately concluded it was all Alistair's fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Didn't I warn you? A freeloader like Alistair is worthless. Fine, it's too late now. Since he betrayed you, your father and I won't let him get away with it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca panicked, afraid her doting parents would go after Alistair&mdash;because that would expose Richard's involvement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The excitement she'd felt when Richard returned was now eclipsed by regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hesitantly, Rebecca said, "Mom, don't go after him. We parted on amicable terms."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You poor, deluded girl. You're still defending him? How do I make you see the truth?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Furious, Cordelia scolded, "I give you 500 thousand dollars in allowance every month, and you spend every last cent without fail. Did you waste it all on him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca couldn't answer&mdash;because all that money had gone to Richard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Every time he came over, he only ever wore those two outfits, always acting meek and obedient. I actually thought he was decent. Well, that little bastard fooled both me and your father&mdash;how impressive. This isn't over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So this is why you kept making excuses to keep him from visiting us. He was probably using your money to chase other women. We're not letting you handle this anymore&mdash;your father and I are stepping in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Out of options, Rebecca turned to Anne for advice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her goal was simple&mdash;no matter what it took, make Alistair admit he was the one at fault for the failed marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before reaching out to Anne, she had even contacted Alistair's father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he stammered and told her Alistair had cut ties with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It suddenly dawned on Rebecca that, right after the divorce, Alistair had somehow vanished into thin air. Seeing him again now seemed impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anne said, "What's the big deal? Just tell your parents you're dating Richard. He's so outstanding&mdash;they'll adore him. Oh, Rebecca, by the way, last night I met this insanely hot guy&mdash;his build, his aura&mdash;just wow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca ignored the latter part and sighed, "Anne, it's not that simple. My parents wouldn't approve of Richard."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How is that possible? Compared to Alistair, Richard is like a cloud in the sky! If they don't even like Richard, then what kind of man could possibly meet their standards?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca fell silent&mdash;because Richard was illegitimate, the son of a mistress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rumors said Richard's mother had driven his father's legal wife to suicide before finally marrying into the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It had been a major scandal back then, but Richard's father had suppressed it. Younger generations didn't know, but the older crowd remembered it clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Morgan family's rise had depended on the first wife's influence. The moment her family lost power, Richard's father allowed the homewrecker to force her way in&mdash;even driving the first wife to her death. His heartless, backstabbing behavior horrified many, earning widespread disdain. Several elite families deliberately distanced themselves from the Morgans&mdash;the Whitfields among them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca had been charmed by Richard's refined, scholarly demeanor and fell head over heels. But after merely mentioning his name a few times, her parents immediately warned her to stay away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She ignored them and secretly dated Richard anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At a party, after one too many drinks, Richard helped her to a hotel room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca steered the conversation back to Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What? Alistair has a wife&mdash;and a daughter as old as Danny?" Anne perked up. "Rebecca, Vivienne seemed pretty into him, didn't she? How could he... Is his wife fat, old, and ugly? Maybe he knew Vivienne wouldn't take him seriously, so he used his looks to latch onto some rich woman and became her daughter's stepdad? Damn, he's got skills."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's mind flashed to those cool, detached yet resolute eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their owner was neither old nor ugly&mdash;on the contrary, she was stunning. So stunning that even Rebecca, who prided herself on her beauty, felt inferior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That woman..." Rebecca admitted reluctantly, "She's not ugly. She's young."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then she must be an actress Alistair hired. He's doing this to mess with you. If you take it seriously, you're falling right into his trap."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's eyes lit up slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is that it? It must be.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Otherwise, how else would Dad just "happen" to see him dining with her? He knew Dad would tell me.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He looks like an honest man, but he's actually so cunning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But... is that really it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair's eyes surfaced in her mind again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was an emotion in them she had always overlooked&mdash;disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It felt like invisible hands were tightening around her throat. Suddenly, she could barely breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Rebecca, come to my office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The abrupt call carried Nathaniel's unusually stern voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It seems Mom ignored my plea. Dad already knows my marriage fell apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the spacious, sunlit office, Nathaniel paced with his hands behind his back, brows furrowed. He stopped abruptly, sharp eyes locking onto the composed young man sitting nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alistair, do you dare take responsibility for what you said today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair smiled calmly, "If you don't believe me, what's the point of swearing? Once your daughter arrives, the truth will come out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel's temple throbbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This world has gone mad!</span></p></div>
