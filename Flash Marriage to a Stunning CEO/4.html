        <h1>Chapter 4 The Opportunity</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the supermarket, a small indoor playground buzzed with the chatter of children.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A little girl nestled in Alistair's arms, her tiny frame soft and warm, carrying the faint, sweet scent. She was engrossed in </span><span>stacking colorful blocks, her focus unwavering.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sat patiently by her side, waiting for her mother to arrive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For once, he wasn't being dragged around by that little tyrant, nor was he stuck wearing an apron while juggling dinner prep. For the firs</span><span>t time in years, he had all the time in the world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look! Check out my castle!" the girl chirped, her mood shifting as quickly as only a child's can. Moments ago, she'd been sobbing, and now, her face lit up with a radiant smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was knowing her m</span><span>om was on the way, or maybe it was the comfort of this kind stranger's presence, but her fear had melted away. She </span><span>beamed,</span><span> her joy infectious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't hold back his praise. "Wow, that's incredible! Look at my castle, it's nowhere near as good as yo</span><span>urs."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pointing proudly at her creation, the girl declared, "This is my castle. I'm the princess, my mommy's the queen, and we rule it together!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tilted her head, her eyes sparkling with innocence. "</span><span>Wanna</span><span> live with us? I can invite you to stay in our ca</span><span>stle!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alistair could respond, a middle-aged woman stormed over, muttering under her breath, "You little troublemaker, running off like that! I've been looking everywhere!" She reached for the girl, her grip rough and impatient.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's reflexes </span><span>kicked in. He gently shielded the girl, pulling her out of reach.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that kind of tug would hurt her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman glared at him, barking, "Who are you?" Then she turned to the girl, impatiently waving her over. "Come on! I've still got dinner to make. S</span><span>top messing around here!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl clung tighter to Alistair, clearly frightened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's voice sharpened. "Who the hell are you? Hand her over right now, or I'll call the cops and tell them you kidnapped her!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stood his ground, his tone calm </span><span>but firm. "You've got some nerve. You're the one who lost her, and now you're blaming others?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this had happened with Daniel, Rebecca wouldn't have let him off the hook, and he wouldn't have forgiven himself either.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mommy!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl suddenly wriggled f</span><span>ree and bolted toward a young woman, throwing herself into her arms with a gleeful squeal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was breathtaking. The kind of beautiful that made time stop for a second.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair thought she looked better than any celebrity he'd ever seen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-</span><span>aged woman, caught off guard, tried to shift the blame. "Ms. </span><span>Ashbourne</span><span>, this man snatched Eloise while I wasn't looking. I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're lying!" the girl interrupted, her voice fierce. "You answered a phone call and just kept walking and walking, and then yo</span><span>u disappeared into that big crowd. I looked for you forever and couldn't find you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman's face was a mask of ice. "You're fired."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older woman's face fell. She knew she was in the wrong, but still tried to argue. "Fine, but you owe me this m</span><span>onth's pay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman's lips curled into a cold, mocking smile. "Pay? You're lucky Eloise ran into someone kind. If anything had happened to her, do you think you'd be standing here haggling with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeated, the woman slunk away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the </span><span>matter didn't end there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman lowered her gaze, tapped out a quick text, and sent a directive to blacklist the careless nanny from every company in New York.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair figured it was time to go, though he wasn't sure where the "go" meant anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had nowhere to be.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, that wasn't entirely true. He could always check into a motel like he had the night before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, his priority was waiting for that opportunity the system had promised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, I'm Caroline </span><span>Ashbourne</span><span>, this little mischief-ma</span><span>ker's mom."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman stepped in front of him, her eyes locking onto his with an intensity that caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes met, and Alistair froze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain he'd never met her, yet the way she looked at him felt oddly familiar, like a me</span><span>mory just out of reach.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of politeness, he shook her hand briefly. Her fingers were cool to the touch, and he let go quickly. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hi."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wasn't the kind of man to be swayed by appearances.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was beautiful, too, but he'd spent years keeping hi</span><span>s distance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, inner character trumped appearances every time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Caroline's beauty was impossible to ignore. Even the pickiest critic would struggle to find a flaw.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't wearing makeup, yet she was stunning in a way that felt almost </span><span>otherworldly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he'd pegged her for a celebrity, but he quickly realized her allure surpassed that. She carried an aura of authority, a quiet power that commanded respect, like a queen. Her decisive handling of the nanny only reinforced that impres</span><span>sion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline studied him discreetly. Beside her, Eloise </span><span>Ashbourne</span><span> nibbled happily on a small cake, occasionally glancing up at Alistair with a bright, innocent smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helping a lost child reach their parents or keeping them company until help arrived was</span><span>, for most people, a small act of kindness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair hadn't thought twice about it and was ready to leave. But Caroline insisted on thanking him properly, which was how he ended up at this upscale restaurant with a mother and daughter he barely knew.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lo</span><span>oked calm, but in truth, he was utterly out of his element.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd always been a loner, and after six years of isolation, he'd nearly forgotten how to function in public.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he'd experienced with Rebecca and Daniel hardly counted as "social interaction." B</span><span>ack then, he'd been reduced to something even lower than the hired help. He'd buried his dignity so deep he wasn't sure he'd ever get it back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise got frosting all over her hands and face, and Caroline's assistant escorted her to the restroom to clean u</span><span>p.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sincerely thanking Alistair, Caroline fell silent, and they ate quietly. She glanced at her phone a few times, sipped her juice, and then, out of nowhere, shifted gears. "So, do you have a girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so blunt that Alistair froze, unsure i</span><span>f he'd heard right. He shook his head automatically.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She followed up with another question, just as calmly. "What do you think of me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair froze, his mind struggling to process her words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her striking eyes held his, patient and serious, waiting for </span><span>an answer. He realized she meant every word. "Uh... You're great," he mumbled, the words feeling woefully inadequate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was a major understatement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of looks and presence, she was nearly flawless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never met anyone who shone as bright</span><span>ly as she did.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile tugged at Caroline's lips, softening the cool distance she'd projected. "I'm twenty-four, a single mom, and I run a publicly traded company with an annual income in the nine figures. Providing for my family is never an issue. I</span><span>'d like to ask you to marry me and build a family together."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stared at her, convinced he'd slipped into some kind of daydream. The kind of fantasy only desperate men indulged in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kind where a broke, jobless, friendless nobody gets plucked from</span><span> rock bottom by a beautiful, powerful CEO, who falls for him instantly and pulls him into a new life of luxury and love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a self-deprecating chuckle. That was the kind of daydream he used to have, before life beat the hope out of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a tho</span><span>ught struck him like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait a second... Could this impossible proposal be the opportunity I'd been waiting for?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline knew her proposal was bold, maybe even shocking. Anyone would think she was pulling some absurd prank.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she could</span><span>n't help herself. The urge to ask him was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand, resting on the table, clenched briefly before she spoke, her voice steady but earnest, "My daughter grew up in a single-parent home. She's incredibly well-behaved </span><span>and sweet to the bone. I ca</span><span>n give her the best life, shower her with all my love, but I can't fill the emotional void she feels."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, partly because he'd hit it off with Eloise, listened patiently. As her words sank in, a realization dawned on him. He understood Caroline was l</span><span>ooking for a father for her little girl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made a certain kind of sense, but the more he thought about it, the more bizarre it seemed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt if Caroline truly wanted a dad for her daughter, she could pick from a lineup of accomplished men in her circle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed with her looks and her status, there'd be no shortage of suitors eager to step into that role.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fathom why she'd zero in on a stranger she'd just met.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing his confusion, Caroline tilted her head and asked, "When you were with El</span><span>oise earlier, did you think she was easy to talk to? Easy to be around?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair nodded without hesitation. "Absolutely. She's adorable. Anyone would fall for her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought of her soft little voice, her warm giggle and the way she was always considerat</span><span>e of others. It warmed his heart. Compared to someone like Daniel, who only cared about himself, Eloise was a little angel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's voice softened as she said candidly, "Before the nanny found Eloise, I was already here..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair froze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She's been th</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ere the whole time? Watching us from a distance instead of rushing over?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry," Caroline said, exhaling softly. "Before I got there, I was imagining all sorts of scenarios in my head. I thought she'd be crying her eyes out. She's so shy, so reserved.</span><span> She doesn't warm up to anyone but me..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair frowned. That didn't match the Eloise he had just spent time with at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing his puzzled expression, Caroline gave a small smile. "You're surprised, aren't you? The Eloise you met isn't quite the one</span><span> I described."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair nodded, still processing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I saw her snuggled in your arms, laughing so happily, I was stunned," Caroline admitted, her gaze steady on him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was about her age, lean, with pale skin and a certain fragility in his </span><span>features that made her want to know his story.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His clothes were cheap, but his entire presence gave the impression of someone who had recently crawled out of a dark place and was starting anew.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides me, Eloise has never been that comfortable with anyon</span><span>e," Caroline said softly. "She likes you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair shrugged, deflecting. "Maybe I just happened to be there when she was feeling scared and alone."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline shook her head. "No, it's more than that. You might not see it, but you have this... warmth </span><span>about you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled, a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe she wasn't wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that why you want to marry me?" he asked, his tone skeptical. "I get that you want to give your daughter a complete family, but marriage isn't a game. Isn't this a bit reckless... f</span><span>or you, for me?"</span></p></div>
