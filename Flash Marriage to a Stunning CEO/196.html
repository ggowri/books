        <h1>Chapter 196 Uninvited Guest</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Reed Villa, a man was hell-bent on barging into the villa, shrugging off the butler's attempts to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Leo strolled out, looking detached as if nothing around him mattered. He was about to leave when the agitated man spotted him and charged straight at him. "Big star, huh? Paige is being a coward and won't come out to face me. Well, you're that bitch's son. You'll do just fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige heard the ruckus. Right now, she was in a daze, desperately trying to figure out how to win her son back. She simply didn't have the energy to deal with this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler didn't recognize the man and had no instructions from the mistress. So, he took it upon himself to call the security guards. And if they couldn't handle the situation, he was ready to call the cops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo frowned as he watched the man barreling </span><span>toward</span><span> him, spewing vulgarities about his mother. Normally, he'd be seething with rage if someone dared to call his mother a "bitch" to his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was in a daze, just wanting to get away from this place as fast as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned only because the man was blocking his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for what to do next, he had no clue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo'd canceled all his work. His agent was against it, but he just said casually, "Then I'll quit the industry," hung up the phone, popped out the SIM card, and tossed it into the roadside greenbelt. With his eyes closed, all he could see were the little girl's clear, big eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked so much like his mother, especially those eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo knew what he had to do. He wanted to see his daughter. Even if she didn't know he was her real father and just called him "Uncle" in that sweet, soft voice. Just a glimpse of her would make him content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man staggered </span><span>toward</span><span> him. He was disabled, with a lame leg. Leo easily sidestepped his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man tried to lunge at him again, but the quick-reacting butler grabbed him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler shouted at Leo in a panic, "Mr. Reed, call the police right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo just ignored him and kept walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man thrashed around, roaring in anger, "Your mother is a heartless bitch. She ruined my life! I'll tear her to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo just said, "Well, give it your best shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the butler and the man were stunned for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were like water dropped into hot oil. The man exploded. "You little prick, stop showing off. I'll kill Paige, kill you, and everyone in this place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Paige came running after Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood inside the half-open door, shocked when she saw the man's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could it be him? Does that mean...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly pulled herself together, looking down at the man with sheer disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just a pawn she'd played before, and she knew she could manipulate him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem was, this man had shown up at the worst possible moment. Paige watched as Leo walked away without so much as a backward glance. Her throat tightened, and she fought back the urge to break down in sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely enough, the moment the man laid eyes on Paige, his rage seemed to evaporate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face, once twisted in anger, relaxed. He was in his forties, his face etched with the lines of time, yet still bearing a faint air of refinement, like an old-school teacher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wriggled free from the butler's grasp and bent down to retrieve his glasses that had fallen during the scuffle. He wiped them on his shirt, put them back on, and fixed Paige with a menacing stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the security guards rushed over and were about to haul him away. The man let out a sneering laugh. "Chill out, guys. Ask her if she really has the heart to kick an old acquaintance to the curb."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler and the security guards exchanged a helpless look and turned to Paige, unsure of what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige frowned ever so slightly and snapped, "What do you think you're doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out a scoff. "Come on, you know exactly what I'm on about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige shot back, "I haven't got a clue what you're yapping about. But seeing you acting like a madman really bums me out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's temper flared up, and he was about to explode. But Paige quickly turned to the butler. "Show this gentleman in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler looked hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige said in a calm tone, "It's all right. He's a junior from my younger days in school. We've just got some kinks to work out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Paige had given the word, the butler bowed slightly and made a "please" gesture. "Sorry about the rough-handling just now, sir. Please accept my apologies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Reed family's turf, and there were a dozen or so servants around. Earlier, the situation had been so sudden that the butler had to deal with it alone and had a bit of a tough time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that they were ready, if the man lost his cool again, they'd step in right away to make sure Paige stayed safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man let out a snort, his sharp eyes boring into Paige as if to say, "Let's see what you're up to this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took long, aggressive strides </span><span>toward</span><span> the doorway. However, his limp leg somewhat undermined his otherwise imposing demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler stepped up to Paige and murmured worriedly, "Mr. Reed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's eyes clouded over. "Just let him be for now. I'll try to talk him around later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, she was completely at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't a little boy anymore. He had his own mind. How could she just smooth things over with a few sweet words?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew her son had always been infatuated with that Miley and had been on the hunt for her. But with her pulling the strings behind the scenes, all of Leo's efforts had come to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo had finally moved on and started a new relationship. Even though his girlfriend, Freya, bore a bit of a resemblance to Miley, it was a sign that he was gradually getting over his obsession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never could have anticipated that Leo would still manage to track down Miley, and Miley was already gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, Leo held her responsible for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the opulent living room, the butler served the coffee and then was sent off by Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the vast living room, it was just Paige and the man left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They engaged in a lengthy conversation. Eventually, the man took the ten-million-dollar check Paige offered him, smiling with satisfaction. Then, he hobbled out of Reed Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige stood on the second-floor balcony, her eyes icy cold. "Idiot," she muttered under her breath. "You've got the money, but do you really think you'll have the chance to spend it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loathed being threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he was looking for trouble, well, she would be rough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lame man climbed into a taxi. He glanced at the ten-million-dollar check that could set him up for life with a look of disdain, then carelessly stuffed it into his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fished out his phone, forwarded a newly-recorded audio to an unknown number, and impatiently blurted out: [Is this good enough? If I take this to Gordon, can we finally take that bitch down?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other person quickly texted back: [Calm down.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man grew even more impatient. [I can't wait any longer! If this still doesn't work to get rid of Paige, I'll just grab a knife and stab her to death myself!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other person replied: [...]</span></p></div>
