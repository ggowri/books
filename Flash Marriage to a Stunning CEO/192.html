        <h1>Chapter 192 Uncle</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline was so noble that it was as if she'd bathed in a dazzling golden radiance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When compared to Alistair, who'd only been Eloise</span><span>'s dad for a few months but couldn't bear to part with her, Alistair really paled in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, before Alistair, who was slowly being influenced by Caroline, could even start to feel ashamed, Caroline smoothly shifted the topic. "Honey, if you just can't let go, I won't let Leo meet Eloise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo had no clue that he had a daughter. Even if they were standing right in front of each other, it wouldn't ring any bells for him if it weren't for Eloise looking like a carbon-copy of her mom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was both tickled and enlightened by Caroline's unexpected way of thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly realized how narrow-minded he'd been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When kids grew up, how many of them spread their wings and soared freely into the big, wide world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And how many parents, out of sheer selfishness, would clip their kids' wings and force them to stay close by?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even biological parents couldn't have absolute control over their children, let alone Alistair, who was just a step-father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not that he didn't have the ability; it was just that he couldn't be that selfish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, now, suddenly, Leo showed up right in front of them. He seemed to be getting suspicious about Eloise's identity. Alistair was briefly flustered, but he quickly pulled himself together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, what was fated to happen would happen, sooner or later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd just have to face it head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Eloise stopped calling him "Dad," their bond wouldn't just vanish. The beautiful memories they'd shared together were like a precious treasure chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline was kind-hearted, giving Leo a glass of water. But Alistair didn't just immediately invite Leo in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this wasn't just his and Caroline's home; Eloise lived here too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Eloise didn't want that strange guy to come in, Alistair would flat-out say no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair turned to Leo and said, "Hold on a sec." Then he scooped Eloise up in his arms and walked away, whispering to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eloise, this guy's thirsty. He wants to come to our place for a glass of water. You okay with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise scrunched up her little face. "Daddy, do you and Mommy know this weird man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair nodded. "Yeah. Do you feel scared of him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise mumbled softly, "Not really, but he just seems so odd to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he keep staring at you in the hat shop?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!" Eloise suddenly spoke up, as if she'd just recalled something, "You and Mommy know him, but I don't. Maybe he knows me? Maybe he was just worried about getting the wrong kid, so he kept looking at me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise had come up with a perfectly good reason for that strange man's behavior. With a long, relieved sigh, she seemed to put her concerns aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair beamed with pride, "You're smart, Eloise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise looked up at him, her eyes full of curiosity. "Is he your and Mommy's friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd let her guard down around the strange man. Eloise wasn't sure if she liked him yet, but she was definitely intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair thought for a moment. "No, he's your mommy's cousin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise's big, round eyes went wide in surprise. "So he's my... uncle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was impressed. "You even know what an uncle is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Alistair's age, most folks were only children. And among Eloise's classmates, even though some had siblings, not many had uncles or aunts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise grinned from ear to ear. "Of course! Our teacher said that Mom's brothers are called uncles. I remember! Since he's my uncle, we should let him come in for a glass of water. Look at his red eyes. Maybe he's that thirsty. We can't just let him suffer like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair glanced back at Leo, who was peering over and slowly trailing behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Leo so down in the dumps, Alistair felt a whole jumble of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was once hailed as a genius in the music industry. He'd created one hit song after another, and his energetic performances on stage could easily get the fans going wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he seemed to have lost all his vitality. His slumped shoulders, numb expression, and bloodshot eyes showed that he was going through the toughest time in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could make it through, he'd still shine as a star; otherwise, a once-in-a-generation talent would fade away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter which situation it was, it had nothing to do with Alistair, yet it still made him sigh with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have a perfect life. One might think someone had a glamorous and regret-free life, but that was just because one didn't really know them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they got inside the house, Alistair fetched a pair of disposable slippers for Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family rarely had guests, but they always kept a pair of disposable slippers just in case. Who would have thought they'd be used for Leo?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair headed off to boil water and make coffee on his own. Leo, being here for the very first time, took a casual look around the room before sauntering over to take a seat. "Where's the servant?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair replied, "The servant comes in the morning to drop off groceries and do some cleaning, then comes back in the afternoon to cook dinner. They're not around most of the time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo nodded, getting the picture. "Carol doesn't like having too many people underfoot. She's used to a quiet life. And you two are newlyweds, after all..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trailed off. Something seemed to hit him, and a look of sorrow clouded his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise clambered onto the sofa gracefully and snuggled up close to Alistair. She eyed Leo with curiosity. When Leo looked her way, she blushed a bit, like she'd been caught in the act, but she didn't back down. Instead, she greeted him in a sweet voice. "Good afternoon, Uncle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl's soft-spoken greeting was like music to the ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, when grown-ups met a well-behaved and adorable girl like Eloise, they'd respond and then compliment her on how cute she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Leo just sat there, staring blankly at Eloise, not reacting at all for ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise looked up at Alistair, a hint of unease in her eyes. Had she gotten the name wrong? But as far as she remembered from what her teacher said, her mom's brothers were called uncles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And since this man was her mom's cousin, "Uncle" seemed like the right thing to say, didn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled down at her and reached for the pot, pouring coffee into the cups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was certain that Leo was eyeing Eloise with suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his search for his lost love, he must have learned that she'd given birth to a baby girl before she died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By doing the math on the timeline, it was almost a sure bet that the girl was his own child. Then, when Leo got back, he saw this little girl who looked incredibly like his first love. And this girl was adopted by his cousin. Plus, it was his cousin who'd given him the address of his first love. What more did Leo need to understand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, Alistair felt a twinge of admiration for Leo at that moment. His lost love was gone, but the memories were still as sharp as ever. And out of the blue, he discovered that she had a daughter, and here she was, right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't pester Alistair with questions. Either he had extraordinary self-control, or all these speculations were just that&mdash;speculations. Maybe Leo didn't know that his lost love had a daughter. He was just staring at Eloise because she looked so much like his lost love, which brought back all the sad memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with two possible scenarios, Alistair was more inclined to go with the first one.</span></p></div>
