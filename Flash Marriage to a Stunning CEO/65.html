        <h1>Chapter 65 Recognized After All These Years</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair turned to Caroline. "I need to step out for a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline raised a brow. </span><span>"</span><span>You</span><span>'</span><span>re not about to throw punches, are you?</span><span>"</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He</span><span> smirked. </span><span>"</span><span>What, you think he could take me?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If playing the villain meant standing </span><span>up to his monstrous father, so be it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chuckled. </span><span>"</span><span>Just don</span><span>'</span><span>t forget&mdash;he might bring backup.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair rose. </span><span>"</span><span>Let him.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise looked up, eyes wide. </span><span>"</span><span>Mommy, is Daddy going to fight someone? I wanna help!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She puffed up like a little soldier, tiny </span><span>fists clenched, trying her best to look fierce even as she trembled slightly. Alistair couldn't help but chuckle. He bent down and ruffled her hair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy's a peaceful man, remember? I'm just going to say hi to someone I used to know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That seemed to sati</span><span>sfy her. She grinned. "Okay. Come back soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he left, Caroline took Eloise&mdash;already yawning&mdash;over to one of Chicago's nicer hotels to nap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't worried about Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd made arrangements. Someone was watching from the shadows, ready to inter</span><span>vene the moment anything went sideways.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stepped outside, Alistair glanced back and gave them a bright, toothy grin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sun blazed overhead, and for a moment, his smile overlapped with a memory buried deep in Caroline's past&mdash;of a boy she'd once see</span><span>n, long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That same warmth. That same light. Twelve years, and she finally understood why he had always felt so familiar. Why she couldn't seem to let him go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had met before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather... she had seen him before. Known him, silently, from a </span><span>distance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked, her heart stuttering in her chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't lose control now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forced a smile back and then turned, carrying Eloise away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair crossed the street toward the wedding venue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was close enough now to hear Celeste's voice, high and</span><span> polished as ever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear, Alistair's been driving me and Liam crazy. Ever since his divorce, I've been losing sleep over him. If you know any girls who might be a good match, please let us know."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The groom's mother hesitated. "You know we're close, so I</span><span>'ll be blunt. Alistair didn't go to college, and he's divorced. In this day and age, what kind of girl would go for that? Now, if it were Caleb, that's a different story. He's got the looks, the degree&mdash;studied abroad. He'd have no trouble at all."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb Ha</span><span>rlow. Celeste's son from before the marriage. Once she married Liam, Caleb took his last name.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste beamed, proud. "Oh, Caleb's already seeing someone&mdash;no need to worry about him. As for Alistair... sure, he's not ideal. But he's still our child. It's no</span><span>t easy, watching him struggle. I mean, realistically, he's not going to attract top-tier women. But if it's someone with a kid, maybe a divorcee herself&mdash;we'd consider that."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The groom's mother seemed to think for a moment. "Actually... there's this girl. S</span><span>he's thirty, divorced, and her family's been trying to marry her off for years. They're even offering a million dollars for anyone willing to move in as a stay-at-home husband. Only problem is..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tapped her temple. "She's not all there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste didn'</span><span>t miss a beat. "Sure, that's not ideal. But sometimes girls like that are easier to get along with, right? Maybe you could reach out, just in case. If it's meant to be, it'll happen."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair let out a low laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yep. That was his stepmother, all right.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>ugar on the surface, poison underneath. She'd just managed to trash his entire worth as a man and still make it sound like she was doing him a favor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for the offer," he said, voice smooth and cold, "but I think fate might be a better match for your</span><span> son."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That shut the table up. All eyes turned to him. Confused and staring.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The groom's family hadn't recognized him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't seen Alistair in years&mdash;of course they wouldn't.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The funny part was, neither had Liam nor Celeste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just stood there, blin</span><span>king, trying to place him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste's brows drew together. She didn't like the tone. "And who are you, exactly?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the man was attractive, but this was hardly the time for random strangers to chime in with unsolicited sarcasm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's smile curled in</span><span>to something sharper. "Aw, come on. Don't tell me you've already forgotten the son who keeps you up at night with worry. It's me. Alistair."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam blinked like he'd just seen a ghost. "Alistair?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It clicked&mdash;this was the brat who'd told him off, </span><span>threatened to cut ties and acted like he didn't owe him a damn thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam's expression darkened. He hadn't heard from Rebecca since yesterday. God only knew what this brat had pulled now to get her all worked up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better show some respect&mdash;she's your m</span><span>other!" he snapped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's voice was ice. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mother's dead. If she wants the title, she's welcome to join her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room froze, along with everyone inside it.</span></p></div>
