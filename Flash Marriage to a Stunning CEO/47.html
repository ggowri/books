        <h1>Chapter 47 Meant to Be</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The window rolled halfway down. Caroline leaned over, waving lightly. "Bye, honey. Try to get some rest when you get home. As long as you're up in time to pick up Eloise, you're fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair felt like a kindergartner being tucked in for a nap by a doting adult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay," he said with a smirk. "I got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car pulled away, taking Caroline with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Julian waited at the next red light, a grin tugged at his mouth until he finally let out a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline gave him a death glare. "What are you laughing at?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian didn't even try to hide it. "I was just thinking... isn't your husband twenty-four?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And?" Caroline narrowed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian, undeterred and clearly asking for it, grinned. "Well... he acts like he's four."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her tone dropped about ten degrees. "Are you calling him immature?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, no!" Julian quickly clarified. "He's calm, level-headed, and observant&mdash;actually, I think he's a really solid guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline arched a brow. "Glad you're not completely blind, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian, risking his life, continued, "It's just that you treat him like he's Eloise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian held up a hand, unbothered. "Come on&mdash;you told him to go home and take a nap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline snapped, "That just means we have a strong relationship! You should spend less time being jealous and more time trying to find someone who'll even think about marrying you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian wisely shut up for a moment as the light turned green.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He eased into the intersection and then asked, "Alright, real talk. What exactly about Alistair attracted you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline turned her gaze to the passing scenery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She and Julian had grown up together&mdash;no blood relation, but emotionally closer than most siblings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was three years older, and the two of them had always clicked in a way that made real honesty possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Things she would never say to Mabel, she didn't mind sharing with Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought for a second and then said softly, "I don't know. I really don't. It's just... this feeling. Like he's the one I've been waiting for all along. Like he's meant to be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian's chest twisted with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously? Alistair gets to be the one for someone like her? Where the hell is my meant-to-be? Where are you, mystery girl who falls in love with me at first sight? I miss you, babe...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then again, he smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">On second thought, take your time. I'm still enjoying my bachelor life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stepped into the apartment, dropped his keys, and sank cross-legged onto the carpet in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beige plush carpet covered every inch of the space, soft underfoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He scrolled on his phone for a bit, but the more he scrolled, the more bored he got.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to take Caroline's advice and nap like a good little husband. But the truth was, he wasn't tired. He'd slept well last night and felt wide awake now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So this is what boredom feels like when you're not running around all day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apparently, being a "kept man" had its downsides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Rebecca, every day had been a grind. The moment he opened his eyes, he was running on fumes. Now? He'd leapt straight from survival mode into five-star luxury. And it was... quiet, too quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't even clean&mdash;Caroline had made it clear that wasn't his job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last time he'd gotten up early and cooked breakfast on a whim, both Caroline and Eloise loved it&mdash;yet by dinner, she'd sat him down and told him firmly to sleep in next time. Breakfast was handled. He didn't need to lift a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't about the food. It was the deal&mdash;he was there to keep Eloise company and handle public appearances when needed, nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was sticking to that arrangement with unnerving precision. Even when he offered, she wouldn't let him do more. As if she was afraid he might burn himself out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He scrolled on his phone until his eyes started to sting. For a second, he thought about finding a part-time job just to pass the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he dismissed it immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was responsible for Eloise. What if the school called? What if she got sick? He'd been through this before&mdash;kids her age were stronger than they looked, but group settings meant colds, fevers, and surprise pickups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He flipped on the news and tried to start a movie. Five minutes in, he turned it off again. Nothing held his attention. He picked up his phone and started scrolling all over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, by total accident, he clicked into a fiction app.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, under "My Account," he spotted a button that read, "Become a Writer." Something clicked. He didn't question it&mdash;just followed the prompt. After downloading the companion app and without quite realizing how it happened, Alistair was officially a writer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good afternoon," the app greeted him, "and welcome to Day 1 with Wattpad."</span><br><span>Suddenly, he wasn't bored anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt like he'd just found the game he'd been looking for. He closed his eyes, and in that instant, an entire story&mdash;messy, thrilling, soaked in drama and heartbreak&mdash;began to form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, he started outlining it using the app's built-in tools. By the time his alarm went off reminding him it was time to pick up Eloise, he had nearly completed the full outline of his debut novel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stretched, changed clothes, and headed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise had adjusted better than anyone expected. She hadn't cried once during her first day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Well&mdash;at least not in public. She'd whispered to Caroline later that she did cry but wiped her tears quickly so no one would laugh at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had nearly cried herself. She hugged Eloise for a full five minutes before letting go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of how well Eloise was doing, the teachers had decided to shorten her adjustment period. Starting today, she'd be dismissed with the rest of the kids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair arrived early. At first, the sidewalk was mostly empty. But as time passed, the space filled with parents and guardians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alistair?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned and saw a familiar face approaching. "It is really you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Eva Marsh, one of the maids who used to work for the Whitfields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since the divorce, Alistair had made a point of drawing a line between himself and that part of his life. But seeing her didn't rattle him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His conscience was clean&mdash;he had nothing to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva had always been talkative. Back when he was still Rebecca's husband, she'd treated him well enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Marsh," he greeted politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva stepped closer, smiling brightly, "Wow, Alistair&mdash;you look better than ever. Have you been working out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chuckled but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva leaned in slightly, dropping her voice. "You here for Danny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair shook his head just as she added, "I mean, look, I know Rebecca's a handful. Always has been. She messed up, no doubt. But that's how it goes sometimes. Families fight. Kids need their parents. So... when are you coming back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair blinked. "I never said I was coming back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva gave him a knowing look. "Oh, I get it. You're still hurt. Who wouldn't be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No, Ms. Marsh. You don't get it at all.</span></p></div>
