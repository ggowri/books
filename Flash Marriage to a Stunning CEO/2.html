        <h1>Chapter 2 The Real Dad</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without a moment's hesitation, he chose the second path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all the pain it took to escape that pit, he'd be a fool to dive back in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's temper had kept him on edge every day, always watching her mood, tiptoeing around her outbursts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel, her spoiled son, was a whirlwind of mischief, and as his nominal father, Alistair had no authority to discipline him. Every whim Daniel had, Alistair was expected to fulfill without question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Years of that oppressive, suffocating life had hollowed him out. He'd always been a quiet man, but lately, it felt like he was forgetting how to speak altogether.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Congratulations. You've made the right choice. Life Choice System successfully bound."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair blinked, caught off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even after six years detached from the world, he knew what a "system" was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Host has made a correct life choice. Rewarded with 100 system credits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"System Store unlocked. The host may use system credits to purchase desired items."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At some point, it started to rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair, dressed in thin clothes and worn slippers, trudged through the downpour. Cold water seeped in and crept up his legs, but he barely noticed. He just kept moving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Look, Mommy, that man's so weird. He's like a stray puppy nobody wants..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hush, don't say things like that. Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A mother and child hurried past, their voices fading into the rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair hesitated, then reached into his pocket. Slowly, he pulled out his hand, and under the glow of a streetlamp, he froze. His fingers held a stack of cash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd been penniless, but somehow, there it was. A thick stack of bills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It looked like it was a thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd spent one system credit in the System Store... and it had actually given him a thousand dollars in real, spendable cash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The system was real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair spent just over three hundred dollars on a new outfit, two hundred on a discounted pair of sneakers, and fifteen on a fast-food meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With the rest, he planned to find a cheap motel to crash in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he converted all his system credits to cash, he'd have 100 thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For someone with no material desires, that could last a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he held back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd noticed that the real-world money was the cheapest thing in the System Store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That meant the other items, things he couldn't buy with cash, were likely far more valuable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The store offered things like a Body Fortification Pill for thirty credits, a Rejuvenating Glow Pill for forty, and an Opportunity Card for fifty. The Opportunity Card intrigued him the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A hundred thousand dollars would eventually run dry, but for someone like him, who had no degree and no work experience, an opportunity was priceless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he could just grab hold of the right chance, he'd never go back to that miserable life. No more endless housework. No more cold glares from Rebecca. No more bending over backward for a spoiled, impossible child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a long, hot shower in a motel room, Alistair sprawled on the bed and, without hesitation, bought an Opportunity Card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Opportunity Card purchased successfully. It will take effect within forty-eight hours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next morning, Alistair jolted awake at six, heart racing. He glanced at the clock, his mind buzzing with panic.<br>Why didn't the alarm go off?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He leaped out of bed, scrambling to throw on clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For years, he'd risen at four-thirty every morning, no exceptions, not even on holidays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca had strict demands for breakfast, and Daniel was a picky eater. To prepare a nutritious yet tasty meal, Alistair would slip out of bed while the world still slept, quietly tying on his apron and getting to work in the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But no matter how carefully he tried, he could never fully please them. Rebecca and Daniel always found something to nitpick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Every complaint was met with a bowed head and a soft apology from Alistair, who would then quietly fix everything without a word of protest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He never forgot his place. He was the debtor, and Rebecca was the creditor. He knew his job was to repay her with perfect service, day in and day out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Halfway through pulling on his clothes, Alistair stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As full wakefulness settled in, he suddenly remembered he was a free man now. From today on, he could hold his head high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By nine that morning, he stood at the courthouse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The divorce proceedings went smoothly. When the clerk confirmed the divorce had been finished, a wave of relief washed over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was done. Rebecca was no longer a part of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, it was time to chase the opportunity waiting for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca could hardly believe her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment Alistair had been divorced, he looked... relieved. Almost weightless, as if a burden had been lifted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn't seem the least bit nostalgic about their marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca bristled. She'd let him stay by her side for six years, and she believed he should've been grateful for it. Honored, even.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing him act so indifferent, so unbothered, sparked an unexpected irritation deep within her. However, she couldn't quite put her finger on why it bothered her so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was over now. The years of tug-of-war with Richard, the man she truly loved, had finally come to an end. The placeholder, Alistair, the man she used to provoke Richard, had played his part and was now out of the picture. He was even sensible enough to leave without a fuss, and she should've been over the moon, awaiting Richard's proposal, ready to start their blissful life together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Last night had been perfect. Richard and Daniel got along like father and son, and Richard had been unusually gentle with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This should've been her happy ending, but something felt... off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, with her, Richard, and Daniel, finally poised to live as a happy family, everything was falling into place, just as she'd scripted it. Yet a nagging restlessness gnawed at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Alistair turned to leave without a word, that restlessness boiled over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey, Alistair!" Rebecca snapped, yanking off her sunglasses and fixing him with a cold stare.</p></div>
