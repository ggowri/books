        <h1>Chapter 227 A Little Brother?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, during the wait for the test results, Alistair remained calmer than Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the result was positive, it would be a </span><span>blessing. If not, he had no regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with that steady mindset, the moment he saw the results on paper, his brain went completely blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Caroline, who had been tense the whole time, finally let out a long breath of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, t</span><span>he results did not disappoint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stared at the report for what felt like an eternity. When the reality finally sank in, he swept Caroline into his arms and spun her in excited circles, only to remember halfway through </span><span>that things</span><span> were different now.</span><span> He needed to be careful. He gently set her down, his voice catching unexpectedly as he whispered, "Sweetheart, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline laughed. "Sweetheart, don't thank me like I did this on my own. This baby isn't just yours&mdash;it's ours. If anyone should be t</span><span>hanking someone, I should thank you too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair held her tightly, unwilling to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hospital was busy, with people coming and going all around them. The affectionate, picture-perfect couple stood out wherever they went, drawing plenty of curious </span><span>glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they both wore masks. No one recognized them for now. But with attention growing by the second, the risk of exposure climbed with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head out," Caroline said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, let's go. Should we tell everyone the good news?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ca</span><span>roline thought for a moment. "Not yet. Let's wait a little longer, at least until we're further along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to tempt fate. The early months were always delicate, and it felt too soon to say the words out loud. They'd wait just a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment they left the hospital to when they arrived home, Alistair couldn't stop smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky looked the same. The world hadn't changed. But to him, everything felt brand new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every cell in his body buzzed with energy. He didn't know what to do</span><span> with himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline sat on the couch, watching him bounce around the house. He poured her a glass of water, and when she took it from him, she couldn't help but laugh. "You look ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't even sit down. He crouched in front of </span><span>her, gazing up with warm, sparkling eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was just his imagination&mdash;or maybe it was real&mdash;but something about Caroline felt different now. Her whole aura seemed softer, more radiant.</span><br><span>Is this what people mean by the glow of motherhood?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently mass</span><span>aged her legs. "Oh, so your husband seems ridiculous to you now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline grinned. "Not at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you just said I looked ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She played dumb. "Did I? I don't remember that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair laughed. "</span><span>They</span><span> say pregnancy makes your brain foggy. I gues</span><span>s it really is true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline cradled her glass with both hands, smiling. "If I do get all foggy and forgetful, will you still love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair mimicked her tone. "You sound ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A little over a month passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike other expecting mothers who s</span><span>uffered from nausea and morning sickness, Caroline hardly reacted at all. She never vomited. Her appetite stayed the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, almost the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one thing that changed? She became much sleepier than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One early morning, Eloise came </span><span>bounding into the room with her long hair flying behind her. She looked so thrilled that Alistair couldn't help but ask, "Did you have a nice dream last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise </span><span>gasped,</span><span> eyes wide. "Wow, Daddy, you're amazing! How did you know I had a dream? Can you </span><span>guess what it was?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair made several guesses, and Eloise shook her head each time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I give up," he said, holding up his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned close, her voice brimming with excitement. "I dreamed that Mommy had a baby, and it was a little brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alista</span><span>ir froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't told anyone about the pregnancy yet. Not even Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somewhere in the back of his mind, Alistair recalled an old wives' tale&mdash;something about how kids could always guess the baby's gender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then again, wasn't there also a say</span><span>ing that dreams meant the opposite?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not that it mattered to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was a boy, he'd make the perfect partner-in-crime for Eloise. If it was a girl, the two of them would grow up as sisters, hand in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Either way, the baby was Caroline's, and that alo</span><span>ne was enough for him to love them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After brushing teeth, getting dressed, and doing Eloise's hair, Alistair was ready to take her to school. But not before they completed her very important morning routine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Alistair's lead, she tiptoed in</span><span>to the master bedroom, leaned over the edge of the bed, and whispered to the sleeping Caroline, "Mommy, I'm going to preschool now. See you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still caught up in her dream, Eloise glanced down at Caroline's belly. Then she looked up at </span><span>Alistair. He understood right away and gave a little nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise beamed and gently placed her hand on the blanket covering Caroline's abdomen. She murmured, "Little brother, when are you going to move into Mommy's belly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He already has," came Caroline's </span><span>sleepy voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes remained closed as she reached out and guided Eloise's hand under the blanket, resting it on her warm, soft stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise's eyes widened in wonder. "Mommy, there's really a little boy inside your tummy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline cracked her eyes o</span><span>pen just a little, and there he was, smiling at her with that soft, familiar look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not necessarily a boy," she said. "It could be a girl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise stared, still processing. "Mommy, are you really going to have a baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline gave a quiet "mm-hmm". "Very</span><span> soon, you're going to be a big sister. Are you excited?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise didn't answer. She just stared at Caroline's belly through the blanket. Then, without another word, she pulled her hand back and ran off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair and Caroline stared at each other in confusi</span><span>on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think she's upset?" Caroline asked, worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Eloise had really wanted a sibling, but wanting something and actually having it were two different things. From now on, she wouldn't be their only child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline hadn't forgotten Eloise's pas</span><span>t. Beneath her cheerful, outgoing demeanor, there had once been a little girl full of insecurity and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stroked her cheek. "She'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Eloise came racing back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been running at full speed, but right before she </span><span>reached the doorway, she suddenly slowed down, remembering something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quiet as a mouse, she walked to the side of the bed and placed something </span><span>beside</span><span> Caroline&mdash;a stuffed toy. "This is Snuggles," she whispered seriously. "Snuggles is my best friend. I'm intr</span><span>oducing Snuggles to the baby now so they can become friends right away when the </span><span>baby's</span><span> born. I have so many other treasures. I'll share them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinning ear to ear, she kept her voice soft so she wouldn't disturb the baby inside. "Too bad I have to go t</span><span>o preschool now. But Mommy, please tell the baby I mean it and I'll be back soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise practically glowed. Just the idea of becoming a big sister had her walking on air.</span></p></div>
