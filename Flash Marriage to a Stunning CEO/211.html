        <h1>Chapter 211 Forsaken by All</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The official police statement finally came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The case of Nathaniel and his wife's car accident was formally closed, and after thorough investigation, authorities concluded that Alistair, previously the prime suspect on social media, was completely innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police disclosed detailed information about the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the shock of the public following the investigation closely, the mastermind behind everything turned out to be the mother of the man whom Whitfield Group's heiress had obsessively pursued for several years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A substantial portion of the evidence presented by the authorities came directly from the investigative efforts of Caroline, CEO of Vireon Technologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her own husband had been falsely accused; it was only natural that this boss lady wasn't going to let it slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair turned off the television.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he'd anticipated, Paige's name never came up once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashbourne siblings, Paige and Gordon, were both extraordinarily clever. Only a few could be better than them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon had built a formidable business empire from nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, too, was no ordinary person; she'd made considerable achievements of her own in different areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Paige had used her brilliance the right way, she'd have accomplished so much more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, she'd twisted her talent into something dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet what made her truly cunning was the fact she'd committed countless wrongdoings without ever leaving enough evidence to condemn her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa, who'd now been arrested, likely couldn't fathom how the person she'd arranged to kill had inexplicably become her own brother Antonio instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one thing Theresa knew for certain&mdash;Paige was responsible for Antonio's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had killed her brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa repeatedly accused Paige in front of investigators, claiming she was the true culprit. But without concrete proof, the police naturally couldn't act on mere accusations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Theresa had produced evidence, the authorities wouldn't have been able to prosecute Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Paige held an ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card&mdash;a diagnosis certifying her as mentally ill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But holding that card didn't mean Paige could continue her life freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the very night Theresa was arrested, Paige, already shaken by the fear of permanently losing her son, was forcibly institutionalized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who arranged this was none other than her own younger brother, Gordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon had met with Derek, and after the initial shock and rage, confronted Paige directly, demanding an explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige spewed lies, desperately denying her involvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finally realized that Gordon couldn't be fooled, she revealed her psychiatric diagnosis, using it as her excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gordon was decisive. Without hesitation, he called both Leo and Leo's father to inform them, and before even completing those calls, he'd already contacted a psychiatric facility and arranged for Paige's immediate institutionalization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige struggled violently, crying hysterically, demanding to know how Gordon could treat her so cruelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's response was icy calm. "You're sick. I'm simply ensuring you get the treatment you need. How am I wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was utterly terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How ironic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her arrogance had long extinguished any affection from her husband, their marriage existing only in name. Her son despised her for causing the death of his loved one, mocked her openly, and ultimately severed ties. Her own mother couldn't stand her bitter cruelty, and now even her brother had realized she'd been the one sabotaging his happiness. All familial bonds were shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of reflecting on her own misdeeds after being abandoned by everyone she knew, Paige blamed Gordon for being heartless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Gordon wasn't alone in his coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Leo and his father received Gordon's calls, they each fell silent and then reached the exact same conclusion. If Paige was sick, she needed treatment. They had no objections whatsoever to Gordon's decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone as proud as Paige, being confined in a psychiatric institution meant losing all rights, freedom, dignity, and social standing. Every passing second was torture worse than death itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During her first couple days there, she still clung to the hope that Gordon was merely trying to frighten her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a few days later, reality sank in, and Paige began screaming and resisting wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even attempted suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how violently she protested, no matter how loudly she begged, not one person she desperately wanted to see would come to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not her husband, not her son, not her mother, not even her brother... not a single person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's life became a living hell. And because Gordon had anticipated all this, she'd been denied even the mercy of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After months of chaotic turmoil, the curtain finally fell on this drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, every step had unfolded exactly according to Alistair's plans. Everyone got precisely what they deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At long last, Alistair's life returned to peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time quietly slipped into July.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Summer vacation had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While summer breaks typically didn't matter to kindergarteners, Eloise began looking forward to a beachside summer getaway proposed by Leo, even though it filled her with mixed feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, reassured by Alistair's promise that he and her mother would visit every other week, Eloise joyfully agreed to accompany her great-grandmother on the trip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night before her departure, Alistair followed their routine&mdash;telling Eloise a bedtime story until she drifted off, then quietly stepping out of her room. He had just returned to the master bedroom, ready to coax Caroline to sleep as well, when someone knocked urgently at the bedroom door he'd just shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair opened the door, he saw Eloise dressed in cute anime-print pajamas while clutching her favorite stuffed animal, her curly hair loose and messy. Then, she threw herself straight into his arms, wailing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Alistair quickly lifted her into his embrace, flicked on the living room lights, and glanced around swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the bright lights illuminating every corner, he confirmed everything appeared completely normal. Nothing suspicious or alarming was visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The apartment complex they lived in was among the most upscale and secure in this city, with highly advanced security systems. Bodyguards assigned specifically to protect their family lived directly across from them. The possibility of a sudden, menacing intruder appearing beside the bed was virtually zero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd only just returned from Eloise's room. There was barely enough time for her to even blink, let alone have a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline, who'd been sitting on the edge of the bed scrolling through her phone, immediately rushed over in concern. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise sobbed uncontrollably, choking out between sniffles, "I-I don't want to leave you two..."</span></p></div>
