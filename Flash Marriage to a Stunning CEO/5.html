        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't about to jump at what sounded like a wild opportunity without thinking it through. It was too surreal. And honestly? He wasn't even sure it was that opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline </span><span>paused,</span><span> her expression t</span><span>houghtful. "I can tell you with absolute certainty that this isn't a spur-of-the-moment decision for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair raised an eyebrow, incredulous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It isn't a spur-of-the-moment decision?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's laughable that someone would make a lifelong decision in that ti</span><span style="font-style: italic;">me and dare to say it wasn't impulsive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm asking for your opinion," she said, her voice calm but firm. "Setting aside the fact that I have a five-year-old daughter, can you honestly say you'd find someone better in every way?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her question caught him of</span><span>f guard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth, then closed it. Truthfully... he couldn't think of anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated, then said softly, "We're from different worlds, Caroline. And you might not know this, but I'm not exactly a catch. I don't have a girlfriend, but I am d</span><span>ivorced. As of today, actually."</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he didn't need to tell her. She already knew.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she saw how easily Eloise took to </span><span>him,</span><span> Caroline had her people dig into his background.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her resources, it didn't take long to get the basics.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Alistair</span><span> Harlow, twenty-four, high school dropout, freshly divorced, and left with nothing.]</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before seeing his file, she hadn't pegged him as someone with a failed marriage at his age. But it didn't deter her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave a wry smile. "I'm a divorced guy </span><span>with no prospects. You're really okay with that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Caroline's charm and success, even as a single mom, she'd have men lining up. Meanwhile, he came with nothing but disadvantages.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He expected her to back off, but instead, she leaned forward, unfazed. "</span><span>I've got a daughter. You're divorced. Sounds like neither of us has room to judge."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to admit that Eloise was lucky.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, her mom was so devoted to giving her a full family that she'd consider marrying a total stranger.</span><span> Admirable, sure. But it was also the craziest thing he'd ever heard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's voice softened, patient. "Don't say no just yet. Take some time to think it over. I promise, aside from asking you to spend time with Eloise, I won't meddle in your life or yo</span><span>ur freedom."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She </span><span>paused,</span><span> her eyes sincere. "And if you fall in love with someone else, I'll let you go and wish you nothing but happiness."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair cut in, skeptical, "If that's the deal, why not just hire me as a nanny for Eloise? Why insist on marriage?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's smile turned bittersweet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a decisive, powerful woman like her faced obstacles she couldn't sidestep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed a husband, not just for Eloise, but to shield herself from the gossip and scrutiny that hounded her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marry me, and I'll give </span><span>you a million dollars a month for spending money," she said, her tone matter-of-fact. "And if you find your true love later, I'll hand you a fifty-million-dollar parting gift. How's that sound?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair blinked, stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A million a month? Fifty million t</span><span style="font-style: italic;">o walk away?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Was she serious? It sounded too good to be true.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Eloise bounced back, freshly cleaned, her face glowing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clambered into Caroline's lap for a quick cuddle, then shyly sidled over to Alistair, resting against his leg and </span><span>fidgeting with her fingers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair reached down, gently ruffling her hair with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He genuinely liked this little girl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bright, sugary smile was like a </span><span>balm</span><span>, soothing the wounds left by years of dealing with Daniel's tantrums and chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For</span><span> a fleeting moment, he even found himself thinking how wonderful it would be if he could have such a lovely daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise tilted her head up, her eyes wide and hopeful. "Alistair, will we see you again?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her expectant expression, Alistair hesitat</span><span>ed, then gave a vague but gentle reply. "If fate wants us to, I'm sure we will."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice chimed in his mind. "New life opportunity detected. Host, please make your choice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Option one: This mother and daughter are strangers with unknown intentions. Fresh o</span><span>ut of a disastrous marriage, you're wary of diving into something that seems even more absurd. You crave a simple, quiet life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Option two: Life calls for boldness. A stunning, enigmatic CEO as your wife, an adorable daughter, and a million dollars a month</span><span> in spending money... You're ready to take the leap!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Choose option one for 10 system credits. Choose option two for 200 system credits. Host, make your decision!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair let out a wry chuckle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The system was practically handing him the answer on a </span><span>silver platter. If he couldn't figure this out, he didn't deserve the Life Choice System.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was certain that this mother-daughter duo was his opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost comical.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His so-called golden opportunity seemed to be one where he got to live o</span><span>ff a woman.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he could do it with dignity, he wasn't opposed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he'd agreed to Rebecca's deal to save his father from prison, he'd stopped being the idealistic, proud young man he once was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair lifted his gaze to meet Caroline's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat</span><span> across from him, poised and patient, waiting for his answer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally said, "Okay," the tension in Caroline's shoulders eased, her heart settling back into place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did she realize her hands, clenched tightly in her lap, were slick with swe</span><span>at.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd negotiated billion-dollar contracts without breaking a sweat, but this? This had her nerves in knots.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thank goodness he said yes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If he hasn't, I wouldn't have hesitated to pull out all the stops to keep him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline knew she'd have gone to any </span><span>lengths, especially since her precious daughter genuinely adored him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And, if she was honest, Eloise wasn't the only one smitten.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cheerful ping of 200 system credits deposited into his account brought a wave of unexpected joy to Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, when do we</span><span>..." he started.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span>Tomorrow,<span>"</span> Caroline cut in, her tone decisive. <span>"</span>No need to wait for the perfect day.<span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">***</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At a high-end luxury boutique, Rebecca slid her card across the counter without a second thought, snapping up a 580-thousand-dollar limited-edition </span><span>handbag.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father was a well-known entrepreneur in New York, and as his only child, Rebecca lived a life of leisure without ever working a day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she didn't go completely overboard, her parents' wealth could sustain her, and her son, for </span><span>generations.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted from shopping, she sank into a plush chair in the store's VIP lounge, sipping coffee with her two best friends.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her friend Anne Thorne grinned, raising her cup. "Congrats, Rebecca! All those years of waiting finally paid off. When's the big day? I'm getting you the best wedding gift ever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca tossed her freshly styled, sultry curls with a playful smile. "Whatever you get, it better be good. Don't worry, when your turn comes, I'll return the favor with something just as fabulous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her other friend, Vivienne Everett, leaned forward, curiosity piqued. "What about Alistair?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne jumped in before Rebecca could answer. "Yeah, that guy's a walking headache!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca's tone was cool and dismissive. "A headache? Please. I kicked him to the curb, and that was that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne's eyes widened. "You just kicked him out? Just like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yup," Rebecca said, her voice brimming with confidence. "He was just a pawn to mess with Rick. Now that Rick's back, why would I keep him around?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Rebecca's closest confidantes, Anne and Vivienne had known from the start the secret her parents still didn't. They knew Alistair had been a tool in her game with Richard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne shook her head, her voice soft but firm. "Rebecca, don't be so harsh. We've all seen how he treated you and Danny these past six years. Honestly, sometimes I thought if you'd just opened your eyes to how good he was, you could've had a great life with him. Guys that thoughtful are rare."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca scoffed, her lips curling, "What, you've got a thing for him now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne smirked, half-serious. "Maybe I do. You knew I always thought he was a catch. If he hadn't been your husband in name, I'd have made a move ages ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, he's all yours now," Rebecca said with a shrug. "We finalized the divorce today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne let out a sly chuckle, her expression calculating. "Vivienne, you're so naive. You really think Alistair was good to Rebecca and her kid out of the kindness of his heart? He just wanted to stay close to Rebecca and live a high life. Talk about daydreaming. Rebecca would never fall for a broke guy like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne didn't argue. She had her own read on Alistair and didn't buy Anne's take.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne, eager for gossip, turned back to Rebecca. "So, when you told him to get lost, I bet he begged you to stay, right? I mean, I get it. Without you, he's got no shot at living in a fancy house or having that kind of lifestyle ever again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca's mind flashed to the moment she'd told him to leave. His face had been so calm, so devoid of emotion. He hadn't begged at all. He hadn't even looked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her thoughts drifted to their final encounter outside the courthouse, his indifferent expression haunting her. A flicker of irritation tightened her jaw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She kept her voice icy, masking the unease. "I told him to leave, and he left. Whether he begs or not, it's useless."</p></div>
