        <h1>Chapter 209 The Confession</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Richard, remember this&mdash;no matter what you face, nothing's truly over until the coffin is nailed shut. There's always room for a turn. Never panic, never lose your footing. Did you hear me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard you, Mom. You're incredible. I can't believe you sealed the deal just like that. If Dad had handed the company over to you from the start instead of listening to all that opposition, we wouldn't be struggling like this today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard's flattery made Theresa feel thoroughly pleased. She gave him a pointed reminder. "Get Rebecca to transfer the assets to your name as soon as possible. This is a rare window. Don't let cash flow slow us down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the funds weren't in place on time, they'd be slammed with a massive breach penalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mom. I've got it covered," Richard promised with absolute confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had worried, at first, that Rebecca might pull something sneaky. But by now, all that concern was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was completely submissive, did whatever he said, and obeyed his every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, there were drawbacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore the uniforms he picked every day, just as instructed, but somehow, she'd lost all the charm she once had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was like a flower that bloomed too fast and faded too soon. There was no appeal, no spark, just bland and boring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, a family of three walked into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Speak of the devil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same moment, Alistair spotted them too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a semi-public figure now, and to avoid unnecessary attention, he usually wore a mask when he went out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline, maybe to match his style or maybe out of habit, wore one too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with their faces covered, their posture, presence, and the air about them made them hard to miss. Anyone who knew them would recognize them in a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for Richard and Theresa to realize who they were. Right after, Alistair's family was surrounded, ambushed by a group that had come out of nowhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unclear whether they were journalists or some self-made influencers desperate for clicks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Harlow," someone shouted, "regarding the Whitfield Group case, you once told us time would reveal the truth. It's been a while now, and there's still no conclusion. Don't you think the public deserves an explanation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They crowded around uninvited, forming a blockade that startled Eloise. She darted behind Alistair, clinging to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair frowned and lifted her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then something almost magical happened. Eloise curled into him, burying her face in his neck, and all her fear disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she felt her dad was stronger than any superhero in her world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion began drawing attention. People nearby started crowding in, not knowing what was going on but eager to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the onlookers, Richard and Theresa stood just outside the circle, grinning smugly as they watched the drama unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the crowd recognized who Alistair was, the place erupted. Phones came out from every angle, snapping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several bodyguards fought to push the mob back, doing their best to form a human shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And over the noise, one accusation after another rang out. "You're only free because you've got the Ashbourne family protecting you, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Justice always finds its way. The law will serve you right. You think you'll get away with this forever? Think again. We're the people. As long as you avoid justice, we'll keep making noise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone turned on Caroline. "Ms. Ashbourne, are you truly unaware of what your husband's been doing? Or are you helping him cover it up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then someone else, malicious and bitter, decided to vent their own misery. "You're a proper heiress from a powerful family. What are you doing with a no-name divorced man? You into something... freaky?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's eyes turned sharp and cold, locking onto the sleazy man who'd just spoken. If looks could kill, he'd have died a thousand deaths on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man met her gaze, shuddered hard, and silently squeezed his way out of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was young, but God, was she terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, backing off now was too late. Every face in that mob had been caught on the mall's security cameras. Each one would be receiving a legal notice from Vireon Technologies' legal team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You rich bastards think you're untouchable, huh? I'll take you down myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone from the crowd lunged forward, driven by hate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bodyguard intercepted him instantly, slamming him to the ground. Alistair, with one arm wrapped around Eloise, pulled Caroline close with the other, shielding them both. His face was grim, his eyes cold as steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had "The Schemer's Bane". Those who hid behind the mask of justice, whether for profit, clout, or personal rage, would inevitably suffer setbacks. But that didn't erase the impact they were having on his life, on the peace he tried to protect, or on the harm they might still inflict on his wife and daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair ripped off his mask and slowly looked around, face devoid of emotion. The crowd, sensing he was about to speak, finally fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want all of you to remember this," he said, his voice low and razor-sharp. "If today's circus leaves my wife or daughter with trauma that haunts them for the rest of their lives, every single one of you here will be held responsible. And I will make sure of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there like a god of vengeance, radiating an oppressive force that crushed the air around him. His words landed like a blade, stabbing deep, and no one who heard them doubted he meant every syllable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People exchanged nervous glances, uneasy and pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, they suddenly understood something they hadn't before. Maybe it wasn't so unbelievable that the heiress fell for this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, just as things began to settle, Caroline's voice rang out clearly. "Some of you wonder why I love my husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was cold, but something in it drew everyone in. They had no choice but to listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look at Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coldness in her eyes melted the second they landed on him. It was like spring breaking through a frozen lake, soft, warm, impossible to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because," she said, "my husband, Alistair, is the best man in this entire world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before a stunned crowd, Caroline made her love known in the calm, measured voice she always used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair felt like someone had dropped his heart into honey. Warm, golden, overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Caroline wasn't finished. "I'm just glad," she added, "that no one else realized it before me. Because now, he's mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her meaning was clear. Whoever had an eye on Alistair now would never stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard's handsome face twisted with rage and jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it. This wasn't how things were supposed to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How the hell had it turned into their moment?</span></p></div>
