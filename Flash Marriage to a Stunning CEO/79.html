        <h1>Chapter 79 Hard to Discipline</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While taking a shower, Alistair closed his eyes in despair and felt that he was doomed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he was a beast for having such indecent thoughts about the extremely weak patient.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Caroline hadn't </span><span>been sick, he could have used his uncontrollable vigor as an excuse. Alistair's mind went blank, and he even thought about banging his head against the wall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how to face Caroline. He just hoped that Caroline hadn't noticed his abnormality. O</span><span>therwise, he really wouldn't have the face to live on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Alistair stayed holed up in the bathroom, Caroline outside was laughing merrily. Her efforts finally paid off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had the answer now. Alistair was straight, and... Just thinking of this, Carolin</span><span>e felt her face heat up, and she quickly picked up her change of clothes and walked into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had sweated a great deal when her fever broke, and she felt all sticky and uncomfortable. Her long hair, which she had just washed last night, was so</span><span>iled by the sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early in the morning, both of them took a shower.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair kept taking deep breaths. After mentally preparing himself, he walked out of the bathroom like a thief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crisp shout scared the wits out of the guilt-ridden Alistair.</span><span> When he focused his eyes, he saw his little angel, Eloise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise had just gotten up, and her long hair was all tousled from sleep. She stared at Alistair with her big eyes and pouted unhappily. "Why are you in this room? Did you quarrel with Mommy again?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was a bit speechless and was dissatisfied with Eloise's choice of words. He and Caroline hadn't quarrelled at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eloise, I didn't quarrel with your father. We promised you to stay an affectionate couple and accompany you as you grow up, remem</span><span>ber?" Caroline's gentle voice came.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's expression froze for a moment, but he quickly adjusted himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pretended to be nonchalant as he walked out and followed Caroline's words to say to Eloise, "Mommy is right. We keep our word. You should trus</span><span>t us more."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise blinked her big eyes and suddenly grinned. "Daddy, don't be so stressed. I was just teasing you. I know you and Mommy won't quarrel."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was stunned. He, an adult, had been teased by a five-year-old. Alistair couldn't help but be a</span><span>mused by this mischievous little girl.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a faint fragrance in the air, which was the smell of Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the corner of his eye, Alistair caught sight of Caroline wearing a comfortable set of home clothes, and her long hair was fluffy and refr</span><span>eshing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but wonder how long he had stayed in the bathroom just now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just blow-dried Caroline's hair last night. By his estimate, it probably took about ten to twenty minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He usually took a shower very quickly, but today, just to</span><span> rinse off the sweat, he had taken so much time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of Eloise, Alistair didn't ask Caroline if she felt better, for fear that the sensible Eloise would worry about Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Eloise around, the atmosphere wasn't as awkward as he had imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But</span><span> Eloise wouldn't stick to them all the time. Once she left, Alistair couldn't just pretend that nothing had happened anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "Do you feel better?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline looked over, and Alistair nervously clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were </span><span>shining and clear, just like a lake, and there was no extra emotion in them. She seemed no different from usual.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair silently let out a sigh of relief and laughed at his own overthinking inwardly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had accidentally had an erotic dream about</span><span> her, Caroline couldn't actually see his dream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the romantic embrace last night, it wasn't his fault either. She was the sick one, and Alistair couldn't bring himself to push her away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, even if Caroline was delirious with fever, she should k</span><span>now that she had slipped into his arms anyway. So, Alistair defended his fame as a gentleman, and as for that embarrassing dream, he could only attribute it to an accident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca said, "Daniel, the floor is cold. Get up now... Why are you biting me</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early in the morning, amidst Daniel's piercing wails, Nathaniel felt so annoyed that he couldn't eat. He threw the bread in his hand aside, picked up his briefcase, and said to Rebecca, "Hurry up and soothe him. Your mother and I are old. We can't stand</span><span> this noise!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia sighed and said, "Rebecca, I told you before that you should discipline Daniel when necessary. If you can't bear to discipline him now, it will be too late when he grows up!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca felt ashamed. The last time she had a fight with R</span><span>ichard, her parents had stayed with her at the police station for most of the night and hadn't slept at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that life would return to peace, but as soon as she opened her eyes this morning, Daniel started crying and making a fuss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last night, </span><span>this naughty boy refused to go to sleep. To coax him into sleeping, Rebecca had shown him a cartoon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw that the cartoon character had a magical pocket from which any magical things could be taken out, Daniel's eyes lit up, and he clamored to have</span><span> the same one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was so sleepy, so she promised him perfunctorily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel got into bed full of anticipation. The first thing he did when he opened his eyes this morning was to ask Rebecca for the magical pocket. Rebecca couldn't find such a thing tha</span><span>t didn't exist in reality, so she perfunctorily dismissed him again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Daniel, though young, wasn't stupid. When his wish wasn't fulfilled, he was so angry that he shouted that Rebecca was a liar. Then he stretched out his hands like a puppy and scr</span><span>atched at Rebecca's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca quickly dodged his attack. Since Daniel failed, he simply lay on the floor and started rolling around.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca knew she was at fault for promising something she couldn't do. So she mustered up her patience and apologized t</span><span>o Daniel, saying that he could make another request.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Daniel only wanted the magical pocket.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Rebecca tried to pull him up from the floor, he scratched, kicked, and bit her. Having no idea what to do with him, Rebecca left him there in a fit of </span><span>anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought that Daniel would calm down soon, but Daniel had so much energy that he showed no sign of stopping, even though his throat was hoarse from crying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eva thought she was experienced at taking care of children and believed she could soothe D</span><span>aniel. However, less than two minutes later, she came back with scratches on her face and bleeding bite marks on her wrist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While crying, Daniel howled, "Mommy is a liar, the biggest liar in the world! I want the magical pocket. Give me the magical pocket!</span><span>"</span></p></div>
