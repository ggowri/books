        <h1>Chapter 28 An Indispensable Part</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard clamped the wailing Daniel under his arm, shot Alistair a venomous glare, and stormed off to his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair turned back to see Eloise's pale, frightened face. Heart aching, he gathered her into his arms and patted her back. "Don't be scared. I'm here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise whispered, "Dad, I'm not scared. I have you to protect me. But that little boy's daddy is so mean. He's so pitiful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She really is a little angel, worrying about the little demon even now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He calmly got into the car, Daniel's cries still echoing faintly in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That brat's been spoiled rotten&mdash;someone needs to discipline him properly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But what if he becomes Richard's punching bag? He is Richard's biological son... Surely Richard wouldn't be that cruel?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not that it's any of my business anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Compared to a son who could tear the house down, a sweet, thoughtful daughter is definitely better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, this is my favorite toy. Do you want it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, have some water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, sit down! Let me massage your shoulders!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, can I rub your legs too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Caroline returned home, she found her usually well-behaved daughter fluttering around Alistair like an eager attendant&mdash;kneading his shoulders, patting his legs, the very picture of devotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was baffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Eloise is a sweet, obedient child. She'll massage my legs when I'm tired, hug me and say "Mommy, I love you, I'll always be with you" when I'm upset, and even bring me water and remind me to take medicine when I'm unwell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But this level of attentiveness? Definitely not normal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She soon learned why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After dinner, while Alistair went downstairs to fetch a package, Eloise tugged at Caroline's sleeve anxiously. "Mommy, today a kid tried to steal Daddy from me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline immediately recalled that Alistair had a non-biological son attending the same kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I should've transferred Eloise to another school.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise's voice trembled. "That kid is so greedy. He already has a dad, but he still wants mine? Even if Daddy used to be his daddy, he isn't anymore! Mommy, he's not a good kid!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline hugged her, smiling, "You said it yourself&mdash;he's not good. So your daddy won't like him. He won't be stolen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise sniffled. "But his new daddy isn't as good as mine. He'll want my daddy back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline stroked her daughter's cheek, her heart aching. "Don't worry. You have me. I'll make sure Daddy stays with you forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Guilt pricked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Eloise is actually a deeply sensitive, insecure child.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The fact that she's still afraid of losing him means I've failed as a mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair isn't just "important" to us anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's family. An indispensable part of our lives.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Eloise fell asleep, Alistair decided he needed to talk to Caroline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd noticed Eloise's unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline sat by the floor-to-ceiling window, the glittering skyline of New York stretching behind her. She held a glass of water, her delicate skin glowing under the soft light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The top button of her coffee-checked loungewear was undone, revealing a glimpse of collarbone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, she wasn't the calculating, untouchable CEO&mdash;but neither was she some approachable next-door girl. Her innate regality set her apart. Even silent and still, she seemed to exist on some higher plane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She took a sip of water, her deep eyes studying Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While he'd adapted easily to being Eloise's father, stepping into the role of Caroline's husband felt far more daunting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he struggled to phrase his thoughts, Caroline suddenly sighed, "I'm so jealous of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair blinked, confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You've only known Eloise for a few days, yet she's already this attached." Though she claimed envy, her tone and expression radiated warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Carol, there's something I wanted to discuss," Alistair said. Calling her "Carol" still felt unnatural&mdash;"Ms. Ashbourne" rolled off his tongue more easily, but that was too distant now. "My ex-wife's son attends the same kindergarten. I saw him today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd said "my ex-wife's son," not "my son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The distinction was deliberate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline, knowing the truth, caught the nuance immediately. She nodded. "Eloise told me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair looked remorseful. "I'm sorry. She seemed really unsettled. My reassurances didn't help much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes. She's terrified you'll abandon her." Another sigh, "The best decision I ever made was bringing you into her life. These past few days, she's been smiling more than ever. A stable family environment is so crucial for a child's growth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair wholeheartedly agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Raised in a home devoid of warmth, he'd grown into a withdrawn adult despite his grandfather's love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline frowned, "I'm thrilled Eloise is opening up, but I'm also... worried."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair straightened, adopting the posture of a subordinate awaiting instructions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline suppressed a twinge of irritation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why must he keep this distance? His boundaries are perfectly reasonable&mdash;I'm the one being strange.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's like I'm possessed, obsessing over his every reaction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't misunderstand&mdash;I'm not having second thoughts. I just worry you might... leave us too soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet Eloise's angelic sweetness and Caroline's respect had given Alistair a taste of heaven after years in hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This newfound happiness sometimes left him uneasy too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What if Caroline one day met her true love? However painful, he'd have to step aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair met her gaze. "First, I'm truly happy Eloise has grown fond of me. If possible, I'd love to watch her grow up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's heart leaped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Eloise is only five. Watching her "grow up" would mean over a decade together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was something about Alistair&mdash;when he spoke, others believed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't make promises lightly," she teased. "What if you meet your soulmate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Faced with this shrewd CEO, Alistair seemed guileless as blank paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He smiled then&mdash;a smile tinged with a disillusionment toward love he himself hadn't noticed.</p></div>
