        <h1>Chapter 189 Punishment or Reward</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was tied up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yes, it was the same ridiculous pink rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, though, Caroline had upped the intimidation factor. To make him confess quickly, she had somehow managed to get her hands on a whip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paced slowly in front of him, radiating all the haughty, regal energy of a dominatrix queen. With a quick flick of her wrist, the whip cracked through the air with a sharp snap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darling," she said coolly, "you better start talking. Aside from secretly asking Aaron to investigate behind my back, what else have you been hiding from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stared at the pink whip in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not satisfied with his silence, Caroline leaned in like a rogue in an old film, using two fingers to lift his chin until their eyes met.</span><br><span>"I'm talking to you," she said, her voice teasing but firm. "Lost your voice? If you're going to pretend I don't exist, then don't expect me to set you free anytime soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That snapped him out of it. He smiled up at her, all charm and zero shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd just been wondering&mdash;if she was already pulling out whips, were the pink handcuffs next?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly... he wouldn't mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline tried to keep a straight face. "No smiling. Answer the question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God, he looked adorable when he grinned like that. For a second, she nearly lost it. She almost threw the whip aside just to jump into his arms and kiss him senseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's getting sneaky! He's using cuteness as a weapon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her jaw and forced her face back into a stern mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too bad for her, it had zero effect on Alistair. If anything, he found it even more endearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she held his chin, he tilted his head toward her fingers with a subtle pout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The message couldn't have been more obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline froze. "No, stop this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't give in, Caroline! Do not give in! Stay focused!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to act unfazed, but her eyes kept drifting to his lips&mdash;healthy, pink, soft&mdash;and just close enough to kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the honey trap never went out of style. It worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she, the woman who prided herself on self-control, was about to be undone by one smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, sensing her hesitation, closed his eyes and leaned into the moment, the anticipation practically radiating off him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That bastard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline caved. She pressed the lightest kiss to his lips&mdash;a quick, fluttering touch&mdash;then immediately straightened up, forced her smile back down, and cracked the whip again for good measure. The sharp crack tore through the air like a gunshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair jolted hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline dropped the whip on reflex and pulled him into a hug, guilt washing over her.</span><br><span>"There, there," she said, patting his back like she'd just frightened a puppy. "Don't be scared..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair buried his face in her neck and started shaking even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced down and realized he was laughing. "You little&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned mid-laugh. "Okay, okay, I admit it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at him, half-laughing herself, half in disbelief. "Wait... so there really is something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sobered a little, eyes softening. "Eloise's sixth birthday is coming up soon, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline nodded. "In about three months."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her birthday was at the end of August.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still lying flat against the couch, Alistair relaxed into the cushions. "I've been secretly preparing a birthday gift for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's it?" Caroline blinked. "That's what you've been hiding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A surprise for Eloise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm-hmm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned, thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say anything, Alistair rushed to add, "I promise, next time I'll tell you first. No more secrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wasn't mad," she murmured, settling against his chest. "I was just thinking... I'm kind of amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was new. Alistair raised an eyebrow, amused by her sudden self-praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" he said, using the tone he usually saved for teasing children. "And what makes you so amazing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I found Eloise the best dad in the world. That's got to count for something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rested her chin on his chest, her eyes sparkling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, Alistair got it. All that praise? It had been for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze turned soft, warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to stroke her cheek but remembered his hands were still tied behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's brain short-circuited at that word. Her cheeks flushed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swear to God, Alistair had zero ulterior motives. But Caroline's reaction&mdash;her sudden silence, the color rushing to her face&mdash;brought back vivid memories of the last time he'd been tied up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His throat tightened. His breath hitched.</span><br><span>Okay. That's dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted, darker now, and sticky with unspoken heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline blinked, trying to keep her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why does it always end up like this?</span><br><span>Every time she tried to "punish" him, the situation veered completely off-track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't punishment anymore. It was a reward. A full-on incentive package.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Alistair lay sprawled in bed, thoroughly satisfied, lazily twirling a strand of her hair between his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to know what I got Eloise?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline nestled deeper into his chest. "Kind of... but not really. It's close enough now. I'll wait and see. Besides, I know you were trying to surprise both of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly, "Fair enough." After a beat, he asked, "Any word from Leo? He should know the truth by now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a week since Caroline had sent him the address.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mumbled sleepily, "Not sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was tired. Let her rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into a heavy, peaceful quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Caroline suddenly muttered, "Paige is such a damn snake."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair opened his eyes and gently patted her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was no fool. She left nothing behind&mdash;not a footprint, not a shadow. Even if the police started with the driver's cousin, they'd only be able to trace it back to the Morgans but not to Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like when she'd manipulated Giselle into launching that smear campaign online. All done through psychological suggestion. No direct evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So what now? Just let her get away with it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline would dig something up eventually&mdash;of that, he had no doubt. But if there was a faster route, why not take it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd been scrambling for days, reacting to hit after hit. Now it was time to go on the offensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wasn't interested in playing petty games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted Paige out of Caroline's life permanently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes again. Anyone watching might think he had drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But inside his mind, a stream of memories began to unravel&mdash;Paige's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had secrets. Paige had more than most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them made Alistair's eyes snap open. He stared down at Caroline, sleeping quietly in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twelve years ago, their lives had already crossed paths. They just didn't know it yet.</span></p></div>
