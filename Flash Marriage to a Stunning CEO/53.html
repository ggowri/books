        <h1>Chapter 53 Will You Behave in Your Sleep?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's semi-dry hair fell loosely around her shoulders in a fluffy cloud. She stared in frustration at Alistair's retreating back as he walked toward the bedroom door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After everything she'd said, after all this "self-sacrifice," if Alistair was still hemming and hawing, she had to wonder if she had any appeal as a woman in his eyes at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't help thinking back to their first meeting. When Alistair saw her, there hadn't been that spark of amazement in his eyes, had there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike other girls, Caroline didn't obsess over her appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, from people's reactions throughout her life, she knew she was pretty damn gorgeous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her looks were actually the least remarkable thing about her. She preferred keeping a low profile and staying out of the spotlight. But life had other plans. Her striking beauty always brought her the kind of attention she never asked for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline hated how guys would practically pop their eyeballs out staring at her. It made her skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet when someone&mdash;namely Alistair&mdash;completely ignored her beauty, she couldn't help overthinking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe she really did have double standards, just like Alistair had pointed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, the real reason was simple. She cared about Alistair. That was why his opinion of her mattered so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Alistair's hand already on the doorknob, Caroline blurted out impatiently, "What are you doing now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice carried a note of disappointment she didn't even notice herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair scratched his head. "There's only one blanket on the bed. I'm going to grab mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, sharing one blanket would definitely turn nothing into something!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh. Fine, go ahead then," Caroline replied coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Alistair left, Caroline covered her face, mortified. Thank goodness she'd kept her composure. She'd almost let Alistair see how flustered she really was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair returned to the small room he'd been staying in for several days, the one he'd already grown accustomed to, and silently said his goodbyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He picked up his meticulously folded blanket and trudged back toward Caroline's room with heavy steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sudden shout made Alistair jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise stood in front of her bedroom door, looking troubled. "Didn't you and Mom make up? Why are you still sleeping in your own room?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A mother really does know her daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder Caroline had insisted he sleep in her bedroom. She'd anticipated their little spy would be checking up on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In reality, it wasn't like that at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline simply didn't want to waste the perfect opportunity her precious daughter had created.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your mom doesn't have enough blankets," Alistair explained. "I'm taking one over to her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise sighed dramatically, like an adult. "I thought you guys were just pretending to make up. But Dad, can't you and Mom share a blanket? Snuggles and I share one every night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Snuggles was her little brown teddy bear. She couldn't fall asleep without clutching him tightly every night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair couldn't help but smile, "You and Snuggles are little kids. Mom and Dad are adults. It would be too cramped under one blanket."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the bedroom, Caroline heard this and sighed.</span><br><span>A seven-foot-wide blanket is plenty big enough for two people, thank you very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, she had overlooked this detail. If she were being honest, she didn't have the courage to share a blanket with Alistair right now either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything needed to happen one step at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For now, just sleeping in the same bed with Alistair was pushing the boundaries of intimacy she could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair returned to toss his blanket onto the white bed, then came back. "Eloise, it's getting late. If you don't go to sleep now, you won't be able to get up tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise obediently replied with a soft "Okay," climbing into bed and carefully cradling her little brown teddy bear in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair gently tucked the blanket around her. "Go to sleep, sweetie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise closed her eyes, but three seconds later, they popped open again. "Daddy, can you please not fight with Mommy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair decided to explain properly, "Eloise, I'm not fighting with your mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Disbelief was written all over Eloise's big eyes. "Then why don't you and Mommy sleep in the same bed? All my friends' parents sleep in the same bed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, that's because Daddy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A brilliant idea struck Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He snored really soundly, and it would disturb Caroline's rest. That was why he slept in a separate room from Caroline, not because they were fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd even thought of an excuse for when Eloise asked why he hadn't mentioned this before. He'd say he was embarrassed and worried people would make fun of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise would definitely say, "No, Daddy, it's not like you want to snore. It's something you can't control. I won't make fun of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And just like that, he'd have a perfectly reasonable explanation for why he and Caroline slept in separate rooms. He wouldn't have to give up his private space today or any day in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair felt like a genius. Caroline would probably thank him if she knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was a guy, and guys usually had thicker skin when it came to relationship drama. If even he couldn't handle it, Caroline, who appeared calm and composed, probably couldn't deal with it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a cool, detached voice interrupted him. "Eloise, it's getting late. Daddy needs to sleep too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously? I haven't even finished what I was saying! What a perfect opportunity wasted, one I might never get back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Goodnight, Daddy. Goodnight, Mommy," Eloise mumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her biological clock kicked in, and she yawned and closed her eyes, suddenly overcome with drowsiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline leaned down to kiss her forehead, then glanced at the reluctant Alistair. "Aren't you coming to bed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Alistair could, he would have sat there until dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline seemed so comfortable with the situation, making him feel awkward in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gritted his teeth silently. "Yeah, I'm coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair returned to the bedroom that was saturated with Caroline's presence. He walked to his side of the bed and lay down, pulling just the corner of the blanket over himself, his body stiff as a corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his eyes closed, all his attention shifted to his hearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He listened as Caroline approached her side of the bed. The light switched off, then the mattress dipped slightly beside him. After a brief rustling of sheets, everything went quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair could hear his own pulse and the anxious beating of his heart. The sound seemed deafening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quietly placed his hand over his heart, as if that might prevent the noise from disturbing Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Alistair pretended to be sound asleep until...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alistair, do you move around a lot when you sleep?" Caroline suddenly asked from the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she hadn't spoken up, he would have thought she was already asleep.</span></p></div>
