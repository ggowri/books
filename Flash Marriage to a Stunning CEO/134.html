        <h1>Chapter 134 Wolf Cub</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste had been arrested for attempted murder after attacking Alistair with a knife in broad daylight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was greedy and selfish</span><span>, sure, but she wasn't stupid. So why had she suddenly lost her mind and tried to kill Alistair in public without any plan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was later that Alistair wanted Aaron to tell Celeste the truth&mdash;that her precious Caleb's downfall and public disgrace had </span><span>been orchestrated by Alistair himself all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was already heartbroken watching Caleb plummet from rising star to absolute nobody. His future looked bleak, and she'd blamed everything on Alistair's demand for five million dollars. Her </span><span>family had been perfectly happy until Alistair returned after his divorce and turned everything upside down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now someone was telling her that this heartless monster had deliberately sabotaged Caleb's life. With Alistair around, Caleb would never recover. H</span><span>ow could she not hate him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her fury, she decided to take Alistair down, even if it meant going down with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who was she to drag Alistair down? Her life wasn't worth his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline refused to let Alistair put himself in danger. Instead, she found a </span><span>former special forces soldier who matched Alistair's height and build almost perfectly. With a mask and baseball cap, he'd appear in specific locations as a decoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, already tipped off and blinded by her assumptions, would believe it was Alistair. D</span><span>esperate to avenge her son, she'd rush in for the kill without thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole situation was laughable, really.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six years ago, Rebecca offered one million dollars to buy Alistair's future and freedom. Celeste, afraid Liam wouldn't agree, pushed hard fo</span><span>r the deal and shamelessly bargained Alistair's worth up to two million dollars, treating him like nothing more than livestock ready for slaughter. She'd been proud of that deal for years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the moment someone threatened her own son's future, Celeste imm</span><span>ediately went on the warpath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she was just bullying Alistair because he was a helpless kid with no mother to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she never expected was that the little cub they'd exploited was actually a wolf pup. Now that he'd grown up, nobody wa</span><span>s getting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam was paralyzed and bedridden. Celeste was facing years in prison. And Caleb, who once looked down on Alistair and thought him only worthy of shining his shoes, had become a total wreck with no parents, no job, no relationship, and a rui</span><span>ned reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To save money, Celeste had placed Liam in a nursing home with terrible conditions. The service was just as bad, barely managing to provide three meals a day to keep residents fed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The food situation at the nursing home was typical, with caf</span><span>eteria-style cooking that skipped on salt and skimped on oil. If residents found it unpalatable, that was their problem, not the home's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the lawyer, Celeste was looking at three to ten years, and he'd push for the maximum sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, </span><span>Alistair's revenge against Liam and his family was coming along nicely, but it wasn't over yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Liam and Celeste were down, he couldn't forget about Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was already miserable, failing in both his love life and career, and would surely blame </span><span>Alistair for his troubles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the idea of showing mercy wasn't in Alistair's playbook. He had no intention of easing up just because Caleb was already suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving the job half-finished would only come back to haunt him later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Elois</span><span>e was growing more attached to Nugget each day. With her new best friend taking priority, she stayed overnight at Mabel's place more and more often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her "abandoned" parents had no choice but to find comfort in each other's company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind their closed bedr</span><span>oom door, Caroline's subtle perfume mingled with the unmistakable scent of passion in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Babe." Caroline lay on her stomach, chin propped in her hands as she watched Alistair emerge from the bathroom after his second shower of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd also </span><span>taken a second shower, and had very cleverly, firmly, and ruthlessly turned down Alistair's offer to "help wash her back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a decision that saved her from being completely devoured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline learned the hard way that cutting corners never pays off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>B</span><span>eing too soft-hearted only led to trouble, and falling for his sweet talk was even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They said, "Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me..." But Caroline had been fooled again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tonight, though, she absolutely refused to </span><span>fall into his trap again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave his short hair a quick towel-dry before tossing it aside. He pounced on the bed like a hungry wolf and scooped Caroline into his arms. His skin felt cool to the touch. He must have lingered a bit too long after his s</span><span>hower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pull up the covers before you catch a cold," she said, struggling to grab the edge of the blanket and tug it over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair held her against his chest as he leaned back against the headboard. "Don't worry about me. Your husband's tough as nails</span><span>!" he said, his double meaning impossible to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline made herself comfortable using him as a human pillow. "How's everything going with the screenplay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair rested his chin on top of her head, breathing in the gentle scent of her shampoo. "The </span><span>final results are in. My screenplay made it through and got great reviews from both the judges and audience. Mr. Robinson called today to say they're getting ready for pre-production. Next up is casting and all that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In recent years, singing competitions,</span><span> acting showdowns, and reality TV had dominated the entertainment landscape, making audiences increasingly hard to please.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screenplay contest jointly held by Emerald Media and Yves was meant to discover quality scripts, not create another viral sensati</span><span>on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without big-name celebrities or trending idols to draw attention, the event had ended quietly with little fanfare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a wife, Caroline should have been proud of her husband's career taking off, but she couldn't help sighing, looking lost in troubling t</span><span>houghts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My husband's getting successful," she said in an exaggerated mournful tone. "Soon you won't need to live off my money anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair fell silent for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly declared his commitment to being fully supported by his wife. </span><span>"Honey, you're giving me way too much credit. A little screenplay like that won't earn enough to even buy you a decent outfit, let alone support myself. Looks like I'll be living off your generosity for life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wouldn't hold that against me, would you, </span><span>babe? Supporting your deadbeat husband forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To convince Caroline just how serious Alistair was about his role as a kept man, he gently turned her face toward his and gave her his best puppy dog eyes. "Look into my eyes and you'll see how completely ho</span><span>nest I'm being."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Alistair wasn't about to waste such an opportunity. Now that he had her face in his hands, he had to make the most of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planted a quick kiss on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd meant to stop at just one, really he had. But she was too soft, </span><span>too sweet. He simply couldn't help himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline froze, suddenly realizing her mistake. She'd thought refusing to shower with him would save her from his advances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How naive she'd been!</span></p></div>
