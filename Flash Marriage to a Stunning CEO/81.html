        <h1>Chapter 81 Which Dad?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing the two voices coming from the second floor, Cordelia shook her head with a sorrowful look. Anyway, Rebecca was her daughter, and she had to think of Rebecca no matter what.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cordelia was well aware that the best solution was to get Alistair back.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The person whom she thought she could just beckon over easily before was now extremely difficult to even meet. Cordelia couldn&#x27;t help but give a bitter smile.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before long, Rebecca came downstairs with Daniel. She applied thick makeup to cover up her swollen and red eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Daniel was given a lecture and finally became obedient. His clean little face looked listless, and he obediently held his mother&#x27;s hand while carrying his schoolbag. Rebecca said to Cordelia in a hoarse voice, &quot;Mom, I&#x27;ll send him to kindergarten.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Cordelia saw her pretending to be strong, her heart softened. &quot;Just stay at home and rest. I&#x27;ll send him.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rebecca said awkwardly, &quot;Mom, I&#x27;d better send him today.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Cordelia realized something and didn&#x27;t insist.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rebecca led Daniel and walked outside. Just then, Eva walked towards them. The corners of her mouth twitched, and then she put on a smiling face and greeted them enthusiastically. &quot;Danny, are you going to school?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, Daniel had a sullen face and ignored her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eva decided that if she meddled in other people&#x27;s business again, she would slap herself. So she let it go.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She gathered her emotions and started to finish the work at hand. Just as she walked into the living room, Cordelia held a first-aid kit and beckoned her over. Eva felt warmth in her heart.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just now, she was furiously complaining in her heart about Rebecca&#x27;s coldness. But Eva thought that Rebecca was just a girl who had been spoiled since childhood and was used to being self-centered. She didn&#x27;t really need to care about what Rebecca did.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><em>Cordelia is still nice to me. Knowing that I was injured, she even got the medicine for me.</em><br/>Just as she thought of this, Eva heard Cordelia say in a hurry, &quot;Danny just bit Rebecca&#x27;s hand. She didn&#x27;t even apply any medicine or bandage it, and I&#x27;m afraid her wound will get infected. You carry the first-aid kit and go to the kindergarten gate to disinfect and bandage her wound.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eva felt that all her self-moving thoughts just now were in vain. She barely squeezed out a smile on her face. &quot;Mrs. Whitfield, Ms. Whitfield will be back soon. I can bandage her wound when she comes back.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">A look of displeasure appeared on Cordelia&#x27;s well-maintained face. &quot;I just called her, and she said she had something to do and wouldn&#x27;t be coming back. I told you to go, so hurry up and go!&quot; She was on the verge of bluntly saying that Eva was talking too much.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eva went out full of complaints and took a taxi to the kindergarten. At the kindergarten gate, she met Alistair, Rebecca&#x27;s ex-husband.</p><p style="text-align:left;">According to the original plan, Alistair was supposed to send Eloise to the new kindergarten together with Caroline today, but Eloise was actually reluctant to part with her friend.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the morning, Eloise said she wanted to tell Zoe about transferring to another kindergarten. When Zoe heard that Eloise was going to change kindergartens, she cried pitifully.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then Zoe&#x27;s parents shyly made a request, hoping that Eloise could go to the kindergarten one more time so that Zoe could say goodbye to her properly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This was a reasonable request. Caroline had no reason to refuse. Besides, it was thanks to Zoe that she had the opportunity to let Alistair live with her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">So Caroline let Eloise go to kindergarten for the last time as a way to repay Zoe.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As soon as Eva saw Alistair, a feeling of guilt welled up inside her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Before, she had advised Alistair to be magnanimous and come back to live a good life with Rebecca. In fact, deep down, she thought that Alistair came from a humble background and wasn&#x27;t worthy of Rebecca, so it was only right for him to endure some grievances.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But after Eva was indifferently treated by the Whitfield family, she suddenly realized that these wealthy people were truly detestable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eva felt filled with remorse. Her so-called consideration for Alistair was clearly pushing him into the fire.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The spoiled and willful Rebecca deserved to be tortured by the jerk.</p><p style="text-align:left;">For a moment, Eva forgot about her task and, filled with a sense of guilt, stepped forward to greet Alistair.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alistair turned around and saw her. He asked, &quot;Eva, what happened to your face?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eva felt a warmth in her heart and thought that Alistair was really attentive and caring.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then a sense of resentment welled up in her. There was a long red mark on her face scratched by Daniel, and both Rebecca and Cordelia must have seen it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eva had worked wholeheartedly for the Whitfield family for several years. Her other sisters, who worked for other employers, got a raise every year, but Eva&#x27;s salary hadn&#x27;t increased at all. Eva didn&#x27;t have any complaints. After all, she was a person who was quite content with her lot.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The indifference of Rebecca and Cordelia made Eva feel very uncomfortable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eva instinctively touched her cheek, quickly looked around, and said in an ill-tempered and lowered voice, &quot;This was scratched by Danny. He was crying and shouting all morning, and Mr. and Mrs. Whitfield couldn&#x27;t stand it either.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alistair remained silent. He knew all too well how difficult Daniel could be.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He lowered his head and looked at Eloise. The well-behaved and sweet little angel was much better.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After handing Eloise over to the teacher, Alistair turned around and saw that Eva was still there.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alistair saw the first-aid kit in her hand and took it for granted that Daniel wasn&#x27;t feeling well, so he didn&#x27;t ask any more questions. He didn&#x27;t want to waste his energy on people who were unimportant to him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In the dark, Rebecca&#x27;s eyes closely followed Alistair&#x27;s figure.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He bent down, his eyes filled with a doting smile, and said something to the little girl. The little girl stood on tiptoe and kissed him on the face. He reached out and ruffled the girl&#x27;s head, then straightened up and watched the little girl enter the kindergarten with tenderness in his eyes. Finally, he turned around, nodded politely at Eva, and strode away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Rebecca sighed deeply. Her heart briefly felt full, but that feeling was gone in a flash—now she felt emptier than ever.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She asked absentmindedly, &quot;Danny, when Dad used to send you to school, did he ever ruffle your head like this?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Daniel was stunned for two seconds and asked blankly, &quot;Mom, which dad are you talking about?&quot;</p></div>
