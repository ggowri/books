        <h1>Chapter 228 Every Tomorrow</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dreams weren't always the opposite of reali</span><span>ty. At least, Eloise's dream wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mid-November, Caroline gave birth to a healthy baby boy, weighing 8.49 pounds. They named him Alaric </span><span>Ashbourne</span><span>, and just like that, their perfect family of four was complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feather Films' two blockbuster releases h</span><span>ad, by now, brought in over seven billion in total box office revenue. The studio had cemented itself as an unstoppable force in the industry&mdash;achieving both commercial success and creative acclaim&mdash;and launched two original IPs in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With sequels </span><span>greenlit, the company began expanding. They invested in new projects, partnered with other studios, and started developing a line of film-related merchandise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alaric turned three months old, Alistair fulfilled a promise he made to Eloise. He took twen</span><span>ty percent of the net profit from The Adventures of Elle the Little Fairy and used it to establish a charitable foundation, Little Haven Trust, dedicated to helping children with special needs grow up healthy and happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Support came flooding in. Gordon, Le</span><span>o, Yves, and the rising stars of If There's a Next Second all showed their backing through various channels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Alistair remembered that Liam had left behind a property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Liam and Caleb gone, and Celeste having wasted away behind bars, the only </span><span>remaining heir to their estate was the very person they had cast aside from the beginning, the so-called loser they refused to acknowledge, and that person was Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He contacted a real estate agent and put the property up for sale. The expected value </span><span>was just over three million dollars. Once the funds cleared, he would donate every penny to Little Haven Trust. In the end, at least one good thing could come from Liam's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The house was priced below market and sold almost immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was at </span><span>the real estate office finalizing paperwork when, without knowing why, he turned toward the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He caught a fleeting glimpse of someone in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After signing the final page, he stood, left the office, got into his car, and drove away without</span><span> looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, from a narrow alley near the real estate agency, a gaunt figure emerged. Rebecca. She stared in the direction Alistair had disappeared, her face blank, her body radiating an aura of gloom and unspoken grief that most people in</span><span>stinctively avoided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew how long she sat there, unmoving. When she finally stood up to leave, she turned and froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was standing a few feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dressed exactly as before&mdash;in a simple black sweatsuit and sunglasses. He was</span><span> a public figure now and dressed discreetly in public to avoid unnecessary attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was calm and composed. He looked confident, polished, and successful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By comparison, Rebecca seemed even more disheveled, worn down, and defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She avoi</span><span>ded his eyes, too ashamed to meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had come back for one reason. He had to be sure. Was she a threat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His life now was full of light. A beautiful wife, two children, and a flourishing career. He wouldn't allow even the slightest risk to t</span><span>hat happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vengeance was complete. As far as he was concerned, it was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca might still be breathing, but one </span><span>look</span><span> at her told the whole story. She was living in torment. Whatever Richard had done, it hadn't just broken her. It had left her</span><span> trapped in something worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard had never been a decent man. Even without Alistair's quiet interference, the greed of his family would've dragged Rebecca into ruin eventually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tragedy of Rebecca's life had been set in motion the moment </span><span>she fell for Richard. That part had always been inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what wasn't inevitable&mdash;was that she had chosen to hurt Alistair. That choice was on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had almost forgotten she even existed. But her sudden reappearance was enough to remind him to </span><span>stay cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been the victim. And yet, human nature was twisted. If Rebecca had become unstable, if she couldn't stand the sight of him happy and thriving&mdash;if she ever decided to act on that jealousy&mdash;then he would not hesitate. He would destroy her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his tone remained easygoing, a quiet force emanated from him. The kind of pressure only someone at the top could radiate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me this is a coincidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca clutched the hem of her coat, her eyes darting everywhere but his. She spoke w</span><span>ithout answering, her voice unsteady. "My dad died."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He passed yesterday, and she cremated him the same day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel, once a man of influence, had died without so much as a proper funeral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't feel anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What does that have to do with </span><span style="font-style: italic;">me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca bit her lip, then took a deep breath, and finally looked up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe this was her last chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life had already been filled with regret. She wasn't going to add to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Alistair, taking in his face like she was committing </span><span>it to memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew how deeply he hated her, but she still wanted to leave behind something&mdash;anything&mdash;less ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just... I came to say goodbye," she said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Goodbye?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between the two of them, was tha</span><span>t really necessary?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm leaving," she added quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair nodded and turned to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alistair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice cracked as she called after him. "I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears poured down her face. "I know I can't take back what I did... but I'm sorry. I really am. I ho</span><span>pe, somehow, you find the happiness I never could."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair paused for a beat and then kept walking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through tear-blurred vision, Rebecca watched him disappear from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wiped her face, laughing and crying all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't tell if she was la</span><span>ughing because she'd finally let go, or crying because she had wasted every opportunity she ever had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she returned home, the basement reeked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard, battered beyond recognition, had apparently died at some point without her noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since </span><span>Theresa's arrest, Richard had vanished. The Morgan family, in chaos, had assumed he fled the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one ever suspected he was imprisoned in the basement of Whitfield Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca stood beside his corpse, phone in hand, reading a message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It said Dan</span><span>iel had adjusted well to life with his new family. He was doing better, behaving </span><span>more kindly</span><span> and becoming a thoughtful little boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had nothing left to hold on to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She calmly handled Richard's body, then sat at her vanity, put on makeup with shaky </span><span>hands, and dressed in her favorite outfit. She swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills and lay down, composed and quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her will, she left all her remaining assets to the Little Haven Trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair returned home in a calm, even mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise came r</span><span>unning up with excitement bubbling in her voice. "Daddy, guess what? Alaric had a really good dream just now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair patted her head with a grin. "Oh yeah? Did he tell you that himself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes. "Daddy, he can't talk yet! But I saw him slee</span><span>ping and suddenly he smiled super big. What else could that mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair chuckled, "Then he definitely had a good dream."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise tugged his hand and led him to the cradle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her favorite things used to be reading, drawing, and music. But ever since Alaric</span><span> arrived, she had added a new obsession&mdash;watching her baby brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She watched him eat, sleep, kick his legs, and cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Eloise, "My brother is the cutest baby in the entire world. Even his crying is adorable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't get enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That nigh</span><span>t, after the house had gone quiet, Alistair spoke, "I met Rebecca today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline shifted her head against his chest. "Oh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she let out a soft laugh. "You know... I'm actually kind of grateful to her. If she hadn't been so heartless, I wou</span><span>ldn't be in your arms now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair could swear she'd said something like that before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and pinched her cheek. "And I wouldn't be this happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline wrapped her arms around his waist, her eyes fluttering shut in contentment. "And I get to have</span><span> you in every tomorrow too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair kissed her forehead. "Yeah. Every tomorrow, and the one after that."</span></p></div>
