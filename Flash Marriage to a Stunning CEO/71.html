        <h1>Chapter 71 Crazy About Each Other</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alistair couldn't bring himself to show mercy to Liam, he certainly wouldn't spare Rebecca, the woman who had orchestrated everything and tormented him for six years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carol</span><span>ine knew how much Alistair despised Rebecca for manipulating his life. Yet she couldn't help feeling conflicted, knowing how complicated human emotions could be. Six years of daily interaction had passed between them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What if Alistair felt something beyond</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> hatred for Rebecca?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finally confirmed that Alistair had absolutely no lingering feelings for Rebecca, Caroline let out a quiet sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Alright,</span><span>"</span><span> she said simply. </span><span>"</span><span>I</span><span>'</span><span>ll help you.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of emotion surged through Alistair</span><span>'</span><span>s chest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise was his little angel. And Caroline&mdash;she was his guardian angel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Thank you&mdash;</span><span>"</span><span> he began with a grateful smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Are we being formal now?</span><span>"</span><span> she teased, pretending to be annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Alistair, please remember who you are. You</span><span>'</span><span>re E</span><span>loise</span><span>'</span><span>s father</span><span>...</span><span> and my lawful husband.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair froze when he noticed the possessiveness flickering in Caroline's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, he almost believed he was Caroline's actual husband rather than someone who had married her through an arrangement for </span><span>Eloise's sake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It has to be my imagination. How could I possibly be worthy of someone like Caroline?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was gratitude softening his voice as he said, "I'm going to stay up. Why don't you try to get some sleep before Eloise wakes up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd need </span><span>to drive later anyway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair made a mental note to put learning to drive on his priority list. It wasn't fair that she had to do all the driving when the three of them went out together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline felt her heart melting under his gentle gaze. "Okay," she</span><span> murmured, kicking off her slippers and curling her legs onto the sofa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's brows furrowed in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is she planning to sleep on the sofa? Why would anyone choose that over a perfectly good bed?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't mind if I borrow your shoulder for a bi</span><span>t, do you?" Caroline asked softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not at all," Alistair replied, his mouth working faster than his brain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could think further, her intoxicating scent washed over him as she rested her head gently on his shoulder. But that wasn't enough. She wra</span><span>pped her arm around his waist, pulling herself closer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's entire body tensed. Anyone looking at them now would see nothing but a lovey-dovey newlywed couple.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had wasted twenty-four years of his life. Despite being married twice before, Alistair </span><span>remained emotionally inexperienced. He was still completely inexperienced when it came to romance, and Caroline was the only one who had gotten any real affection from him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The linked arms, the intertwined fingers, and now this embrace...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharing a bed did</span><span>n't count. Though they had slept in the same bed, they had kept to opposite sides without any physical contact.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What puzzled him was why Caroline would act affectionately now when no one was watching. But this didn't feel like an act. Her current clingines</span><span>s seemed genuine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A secret thrill bubbled up inside him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does Caroline... actually like me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why else would she willingly get this close to him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline was exceptional in every way, and even though Alistair had resigned himself to a life of solitude, he c</span><span>ouldn't help feeling flattered that such an impressive woman might be interested in him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His excitement didn't last long before another thought crossed his mind. They'd only known each other for such a short time. It seemed too early to talk about </span><span>feelings.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe, as Caroline had mentioned when they first met, he possessed a natural charm he wasn't even aware of. The same quality that had drawn little Eloise to him might have unconsciously attracted Caroline during their daily interactions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This tho</span><span>ught calmed him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Caroline appeared to fall asleep against him, he reached for the blanket and gently draped it over her shoulders.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for why she'd chosen to curl up on the sofa rather than sleep in a perfectly good bed, Alistair guessed she was afrai</span><span>d of falling into too deep a sleep and missing her departure time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Caroline leaning against him, Alistair couldn't budge an inch. Not that he minded in the slightest. He was actually enjoying it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been Rebecca instead, he would've wanted to f</span><span>lip her off the couch in an instant. Though comparing Caroline to Rebecca was practically sacrilege, a sin he wouldn't dare commit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After who knew how long, Eloise finally woke up. She didn't cry or fuss, just slipped on her adorable pink kiddie slippers a</span><span>nd shuffled out, rubbing her eyes and mumbling, "Daddy, Mommy..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stopped dead in her tracks, blinking rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mommy and Daddy are sitting on the couch... actually, Mommy's half-lying down. She's got her arms wrapped around Daddy's waist with her head</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> nestled in his lap, looking completely knocked out. Daddy's gently cradling her head so she stays comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise retreated behind the door, a grin spreading across her face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mommy and Daddy are so crazy about each other!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since starting preschool and </span><span>making several friends, Eloise had been shocked to discover how much these other kids knew that she didn't.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like how she used to not have a dad and was called a "single-parent child", and her mom was a "single mother".</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And apparently, the dad she had now w</span><span>as her "stepdad".</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All this stepdad, former dad stuff went right over Eloise's head. All she knew was that her dad was named Alistair, her mom was Caroline, and she absolutely adored them both!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her parents so lovey-dovey made her heart swell, though </span><span>Eloise didn't quite grasp what "lovey-dovey" meant. But she definitely understood "divorce". That's when parents fought all the time and didn't want to live together anymore, which would mean going back to life with just Caroline and no dad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise felt co</span><span>ntent being with her mom, but having her dad around made everything even better. With her father present, Caroline seemed genuinely happy too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how well her parents got along, Eloise felt reassured.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They seem so good together. They probably never fig</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ht, let alone ever get divorced.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair spotted Eloise peeking around the corner.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's the little munchkin up to? She just popped out and ducked back in. Why's she being so sneaky?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Caroline stirred and woke up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat up straight, her expre</span><span>ssion still fuzzy with sleep. Noticing Alistair staring at her, she snapped fully awake and quickly wiped the corner of her mouth with the back of her hand. "I didn't drool in my sleep, did I?" she asked self-consciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was at a loss for words. </span><span>She hadn't drooled, but he couldn't help imagining how adorable she'd look if she did.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise came running back in. "Mommy! Daddy!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alistair and Caroline sitting close together, Eloise wedged herself between them, placing one small hand on </span><span>Alistair's leg and the other on Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair scooped her up onto his lap. "Why didn't you come out when you woke up?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even innocent little Eloise had her clever moments. She didn't reveal everything. "I saw Mommy sleeping and didn't want to wake her </span><span>up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was their sweet little darling, after all. She really had been concerned about waking Caroline, so it wasn't exactly a lie.</span></p></div>
