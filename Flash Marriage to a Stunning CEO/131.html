        <h1>Chapter 131 Do as He Says</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady watched the feuding siblings with narrowed eyes, looking smug and self-satisfied. "Come on, Janice. All I asked was for you to have a few drinks with the producer. Why are you making such a big deal o</span><span>ut of this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only took an interest because you're pretty and willing to work hard. I was trying to mentor you, but you're just not getting it. How do you expect to make it in this industry with that attitude? Everything I'm doing is for your benefit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I </span><span>didn't want things to get this messy either. If you care about your brother, you should be more cooperative."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The artsy-looking guy turned to Brady. "Fine. If I do what you're asking, you have to promise the role still goes to my sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alistair couldn't help walking over to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the three people, Alistair only didn't recognize the girl. He knew the artsy guy. It was Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The irony wasn't lost on him. The same street tough who had terrified Liam</span><span> was now being bullied himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of real power, Aaron was just another nobody getting pushed around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady wasn't just some bigwig at Emerald Media. He was also the assistant director on an upcoming show. Compared to a nobody like Aaron, Brady h</span><span>ad serious pull and connections. He could blacklist an unknown actor without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron seemed ready to risk everything for his sister's career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had done her homework on Aaron before all this went down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't exactly a saint, but </span><span>she wouldn't call him truly evil either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron never picked on innocent people. Everyone he targeted had it coming in some way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that sense, he was kind of like those honor-among-thieves outlaws from old stories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Caroline had determined he wasn't a </span><span>threat to Alistair, she had left him alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair walked in, all three of them froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady's eyes narrowed, his darkening expression confirming he recognized Alistair immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron noticed a flash of surprise in Brady's eyes, though his face </span><span>remained composed, showing none of the embarrassment one'd expect from someone caught in an awkward situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Newman, what a coincidence running into you again," Alistair said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady's expression darkened as he glared back with dead eyes</span><span>. "Who are you? I don't know you, so stop acting like we're friends!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was clearly spooked by what had happened to Caleb and his female colleague, desperately trying to distance himself from Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair wasn't letting him off the hook. "Funny </span><span>how selective your memory is, Mr. Newman. It's only been a few days, but suddenly I'm a stranger? And don't bother playing dumb&mdash;I haven't forgotten how you tried to pressure me into dropping my screenplay for your own agenda&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop talking </span><span>nonsense!" Brady interrupted, trying to appear calm. "I could sue you for slander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair just smiled confidently, "Go ahead and sue. I'd love to see whose reputation ends up in tatters, yours or mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady's fat cheeks twitched nervously. He knew by </span><span>now that Caleb and Alistair were stepbrothers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he'd repeatedly warned everyone involved to keep their mouths shut about his plan to protect his reputation, who knew if Caleb had been clever enough to keep some evidence? What if he'd handed it o</span><span>ver to Alistair after Brady refused to help him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this got out, his career would be over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady's expression flickered through several emotions before he forced himself to smile. "Come on, buddy, this is just a misunderstanding. Why so serious? Look, I'm</span><span> so glad to see you here. Let me buy you a drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to figure out exactly what Alistair knew!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever evidence Alistair had&mdash;or didn't have&mdash;Brady needed to shut him up for good. The best approach was to get him involved first, then worry about the</span><span> details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No rush, Mr. Newman," Alistair said coolly. "Handle what's in front of you first. Though from where I'm standing, this whole thing seems like a misunderstanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Aaron and smiled slightly, "Long time no see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron frowned at him </span><span>but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady was surprised they knew each other. He forced a friendly smile. "Right. Just a misunderstanding. Janice, here's the contract. Sign it and you're all set. Be ready to start filming this afternoon. The role is yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a mi</span><span>nor part. Brady could give Janice the role without hesitation. He had bigger problems to deal with now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair walked shoulder to shoulder with Brady, both men wearing equally fake smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contract Brady had tossed landed right at Janice's feet, </span><span>the very thing she'd been dreaming of to launch her acting career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janice looked helplessly at Aaron. "Aaron, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron squeezed her shoulder. "Janice, I don't have much to offer, but the least I can do is protect your dreams."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, Janice ben</span><span>t down and picked up the contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady had already signed his name on the employer line. All she needed to do was sign as the employee, and her acting career would officially begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she tore the contract to pieces. "If my dream comes at the cos</span><span>t of your dignity, I'd rather never dream at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dimly lit private room, Brady's face twisted into something monstrous. "You little punk, you think you can challenge me? You're way out of your league!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just some crappy script. I'm doing</span><span> you a favor by buying it! Then you have the nerve to demand a million dollars from me? Take a good look at yourself. You're not worth that much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair slumped over the table, barely conscious. "What... what did you put in my drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady laughed, "I </span><span>added something that'll make you feel amazing and leave you begging for more! Enjoy the special treat I prepared just for you, kid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What a bunch of useless idiots Caleb and his colleagues were!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady had used the same old trick and caught Alistair right a</span><span>way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Heh, he picked the wrong person to cross. He has no idea what's coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a predatory gleam in his eyes, Brady was already planning to call some guys over to "take care" of Alistair and snap a few photos while they were at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair seemed </span><span>talented. Keeping him under control could give them an endless source of inspiration. It was not a bad plan at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Brady congratulated himself on his genius, he turned to go call his guys. But then, he noticed something off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, who should've bee</span><span>n slumped over the table in a daze, suddenly flashed a cold, mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That wasn't right. He should be burning up with desire and miserable by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady needed another look to be sure. He watched in shock as Alistair, who'd been limp just seconds ago</span><span>, calmly sat up straight and said, "I thought you might have some clever moves, but this is just pathetic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..." Brady stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone kicked the door open from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady's face lit up with relief. He quickly tossed a packet o</span><span>f drugs onto the table and ordered, "Hurry up and give this to that kid, then film it all for me. I'll enjoy it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Alistair calmly stood up and said to the men who'd rushed in, "Do exactly what he said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady stared blankly, finally real</span><span>izing something was wrong. He turned around and froze. "Who are you people?"</span></p></div>
