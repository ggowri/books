        <h1>Chapter 126 Conspiracy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alistair, you're still my family, my brother. Just forget about all that bad blood for </span><span>a moment. Are you free today? Let's go see Dad. He still cares about you; otherwise, he wouldn't have gone out of his way to meet your demands." Caleb forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The word "brother" made Alistair's skin crawl so badly he nearly threw up his lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He c</span><span>ouldn't tell if Caleb was deliberately trying to disgust him or attempting to play the family card to set up whatever scheme they were planning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair looked at him with mockery. He couldn't remember the last time he'd actually sat face to face with Cal</span><span>eb like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The irony wasn't lost on Alistair. Caleb was supposed to be the burden, but somehow Alistair had become the outsider. Funny how that worked&mdash;Caleb got to be the precious legitimate son while he was just the pitiful bastard. Fate really had a w</span><span>ay of twisting things around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caleb, don't pretend you don't know I've cut ties with Liam," Alistair said. "He's your father. I didn't bother competing for his attention when I was young, and I care even less now. He treats you well, so take good care of </span><span>him in return. Just don't waste the love he's given you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was done wasting his time. He stood up and headed for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb quickly followed. "We're all adults here. You really think you can just decide to end things and have no </span><span>connection to my dad anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stopped in his tracks. "I'm not selling my screenplay, so stop wasting your energy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb shrugged like it didn't matter. "It's your work, so that's your call. But I'm talking about my dad right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just </span><span>said it yourself. He's YOUR dad," Alistair shot back. "So what's that got to do with me? You think I can't legally cut ties with him? Fine, you're right. Tell you what? Go back and tell him to sue me if he wants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb stood frozen in place, his expressio</span><span>n dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever spell Alistair had cast on Liam was powerful. He and Celeste had repeatedly urged Liam to sue Alistair for the five million dollars, claiming the legitimate two million dollars was willingly given. After six years, they were confident Alis</span><span>tair couldn't prove he'd been sold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Liam, who used to do everything they asked, absolutely refused. When they decided to confront Alistair themselves, Liam had actually fallen out of his hospital bed in panic, desperate to stop them from causing troubl</span><span>e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair moved forward cautiously. He knew this couldn't be so simple. They wouldn't let him walk away that easily when they hadn't gotten what they wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, just as he was about to cross the street, a scantily-dressed young woman suddenly s</span><span>tumbled toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, already on high alert, dodged her immediately, not letting her touch even the edge of his clothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman screamed as she fell to the ground, completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb watched from a distance, equally shocked. Well, their </span><span>first attempt failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told himself not to worry. This was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's eyes filled with tears from the pain. She remained on her knees where she'd fallen, her chest practically spilling out of her low-cut top, drawing attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She l</span><span>ooked up at Alistair with tears in her eyes. "It hurts," she pouted. "Won't you help me, handsome?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was sweet and flirtatious enough to melt anyone's resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, however, proved himself completely immune to her charms. "Your arms and legs </span><span>work just fine," he said flatly. "Get up yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair could already see where this was heading. The whole "knight rescues damsel" routine was a trap, and Brady and Caleb had set him up perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he showed any interest i</span><span>n this woman, he'd immediately be dragged through the mud and publicly humiliated until he gave in to their demands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the most clever scheme, but it would've been effective on most men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for them, pretty women had zero effect on Alist</span><span>air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, who could possibly compare to Caroline? These amateurs were out of their league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the woman saw Alistair turning to leave, she played her trump card. "Take one more step and I'll scream that you assaulted me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair glanced around, l</span><span>ooking for witnesses.</span><br><span>"Don't bother," she smirked. "The security cameras around here are broken. It'll be your word against mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair could only stare in disbelief. He smiled, "You sure the security cameras around here are broken?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young woman go</span><span>t up from the ground, her face smug with the certainty she had Alistair cornered. "Absolutely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking his silence for fear, she flashed a seductive smile and deliberately pushed out her impressive chest. "Come on, handsome. Don't be </span><span>so boring. Between us, I think you're pretty cute. How about we go to my place and get to know each other better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talking with you doesn't sound very interesting. Let's bring him too." Alistair pointed back at Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span><br><span>An hour later, hysterical screa</span><span>ms erupted from an apartment, followed by a man's panicked explanations and another woman's furious shouting.</span><br><span>"Unbelievable, Caleb! I catch you in bed with her, and you still have the nerve to make excuses? We're done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene descended into </span><span>mayhem, with screaming women, tearing clothes, stinging slaps, heated arguments, and angry shouts all crashing together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sat calmly in his car outside the building, enjoying the drama unfolding above. While not the ideal spot for witnessing everyt</span><span>hing firsthand, he had a front-row seat to the fallout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As luck would have it, a social media influencer with hundreds of thousands of followers lived in the same building. They had managed to squeeze into the apartment as soon as the drama started, livest</span><span>reaming the cheating scandal to their eager audience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one corner, a young woman huddled half-dressed, her face scratched and tear-streaked as she sobbed uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Caleb, not even bothering to pull up his pants, desperately grabbed at hi</span><span>s girlfriend's hand, trying to explain. She responded with a vicious slap across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, someone called the police, who arrived to haul everyone down to the station for questioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb looked absolutely destroyed as an irritated officer pu</span><span>shed him forward. He glanced up just in time to notice a Bentley parked along the curb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered how Anne had felt sorry for him, offering to buy him a BMW. It wasn't quite a Bentley, but nothing to sneeze at either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb wanted to tear </span><span>Alistair limb from limb. Even though Alistair had seen through their plan, they'd still managed to lure him in. That meant they could move forward with the next phase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But somehow, the drugged water they'd prepared for Alistair ended up in their own drinks</span><span> instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Caleb couldn't control himself and things got heated with his female colleague, someone burst through the door. A resounding slap echoed through the room as he was shoved violently off the bed. The stinging pain on his face snapped him back </span><span>to reality, and he watched in horror as Anne scratched and clawed at his colleague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind went blank. Everything was ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Alistair was already nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd tried to set Alistair up, but Alistair had completely turned the tables on hi</span><span>m instead.</span></p></div>
