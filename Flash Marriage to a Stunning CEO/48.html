        <h1>Chapter 48 I've Remarried</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. and Mrs. Whitfield met that man. He's decent-looking&mdash;though not as pleasing to the eye as you, truly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva recounted everything to Alistair, including how Richard had been struck by Nathaniel's belt.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unaware of Richard's mother's disgraceful past, Alistair was surprised that Rebecca's parents would disapprove of Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Rebecca wants to marry Richard, does she have to give up all inheritance rights?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair couldn't make sense of the situation, and Eva didn't know the full story either&mdash;but one thing was clear&mdash;neither of them thought much of Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be because Richard didn't endure Nathaniel's whipping as obediently as I did?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alistair, I heard Mr. and Mrs. Whitfield say it themselves&mdash;that man isn't fit to hold a candle to you. They still think you're the better match for Ms. Whitfield."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva wasn't the type of servant to gossip about her employers. But deep down, she believed Alistair would eventually return to Rebecca, so she still considered him family. That was why she couldn't help but share the Whitfields' private affairs with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I'd known you were coming to pick up Danny, I wouldn't have bothered. That way, you two could have bonded properly. These past few days, he's been crying nonstop, saying how much he misses you. Just wait till he sees you&mdash;he'll be over the moon. Anyway, I should get going."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eva," Alistair sighed with a faint smile, "I'm not here for Danny."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva froze. "Then why are you here? Have you... left them for good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair replied calmly, "Rebecca and I are divorced. I have no ties to her&mdash;or the Whitfield family&mdash;anymore. I won't be going back."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh..." Eva assumed he was just upset and tried to console him. "Alistair, I know you're hurting. And I understand. But I don't think this is entirely a bad thing. Mr. and Mrs. Whitfield are starting to see your worth, and Ms. Whitfield will learn to appreciate you."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only a handful of people knew the truth about Alistair and Rebecca's relationship. Even her parents were in the dark&mdash;how could Eva possibly know?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair said firmly, "Eva, I'll be honest with you. I've already remarried. Today, I'm here to pick up my stepdaughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva gaped, "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Eloise emerged&mdash;this time, hand in hand with a girl about her height.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beaming, she introduced, "Daddy, this is my best friend! Her name is Zoe Stone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe greeted Alistair shyly, "Hello."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight left Eva utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After exchanging pleasantries with Zoe and her parents, Alistair took Eloise's hand and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire way, Eloise chattered excitedly about her day at kindergarten, particularly how she and Zoe had become friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair praised her warmly. "You're amazing, Eloise. You'll make even more friends in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Eva retrieved Daniel and returned to Whitfield Manor, her mind heavy with doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the day Richard had visited, Cordelia noticed something off about Daniel. When she checked, she found his bottom covered in red handprints. Furious, she initially assumed the preschool teachers were responsible&mdash;only to learn that Richard was the culprit.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cordelia knew Daniel was spoiled&mdash;loud, bratty, and utterly lacking in manners. Sometimes his shrieking gave her migraines, and she'd urge Rebecca to discipline him.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But blood ran thicker than water. </span><br><span>Rebecca, Nathaniel, and I&mdash;even Alistair&mdash;we have every right to correct Daniel. But an outsider? Never.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A paternity test might prove Richard was Daniel's biological father, but to Cordelia, he would always remain an outsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The discovery that Richard had struck Daniel infuriated her more than if a teacher had done it.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Richard hasn't spent a single day acting as a father. How dare he lay a hand on him?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's despicable&mdash;not just a hypocrite, but violent!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's a hundred&mdash;no, a thousand&mdash;times worse than Alistair!</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fearing Richard might harm Daniel again, Cordelia refused to let him leave&mdash;not even with Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She adored Daniel, but she hadn't forgotten that Rebecca was also a hopeless romantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gently holding Daniel's hand, Cordelia observed. </span><br><span>This child is unruly, but lately... perhaps because of the family turmoil, he's been less wild. Especially after that beating&mdash;he's been listless, missing the spark most kids his age have.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Danny, you've lost weight! I made your favorites. Come, let's eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva hesitated, then spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After settling Daniel in his high chair, Cordelia turned to her. "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva recounted her encounter with Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though he had declared his complete severance from the Whitfields, Eva still saw him as a family&mdash;convinced he would return someday.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had witnessed firsthand his tenderness toward Rebecca and Daniel, his respect and care for Nathaniel and Cordelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Six years of bonds don't just vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ms. Whitfield made a mistake, but she'll realize it eventually. And by then, Alistair's anger will have cooled. He'll come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was what Eva believed&mdash;what Nathaniel and Cordelia believed too.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alistair had told her outright&mdash;he had remarried.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The news left Cordelia stunned. Like Eva, her first reaction was disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is that possible?" Cordelia said. "For six years, he revolved entirely around Rebecca and Daniel. When would he have had time to meet another woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then she remembered&mdash;Nathaniel had once seen Alistair dining with another woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Was he already planning his exit while Rebecca was using him?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cordelia began to tremble, unsure whether from anger or fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was furious at Alistair's cunning&mdash;but terrified he might never return.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Rebecca is beautiful. Even divorced with a child, she'll have no trouble finding another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Besides, our family's status ensures that.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Cordelia knew the truth&mdash;finding another man like Alistair would be nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her worries deepened when Daniel asked glumly, "Grandma, when is Daddy coming home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold dread spread through her. </span><br><span>What if Alistair really doesn't come back? What do we do then?</span></p></div>
