        <h1>Chapter 176 A Favor</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whitfield car crash had sent shockwaves through their social circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More details emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When police confirmed they were investigating it as a potential homicide, the story exploded across social media.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the bombshell: Alistair Harlow, their daughter's ex-husband, was the prime suspect. "No way," Vivienne blurted out, staring at her phone. "It can't be him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The internet had already chosen sides, though both camps agreed on one thing&mdash;Alistair was guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just couldn't agree on whether he deserved sympathy or prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Team Justice wanted his head on a platter. These were the law-and-order types who railed against the privileged elite who thought they were above the law. They demanded evidence, arrests, and accountability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Team Revenge took a different angle. If Alistair did it&mdash;and that was still an if&mdash;could they really blame him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, Rebecca had used her wealth and connections to destroy his life. If not for a lucky break, he'd still be trapped in poverty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most radical voices went further: [If someone ruined my life like that, I'd want payback too.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The debate raged across every platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one truth cut through the noise: guilty or innocent, if they proved Alistair did this, no amount of money or connections could save him. Not with the whole world watching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne jumped into the fray, defending him online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The response came fast: [Why are you so sure?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne replied: [I know about him, and he's not that kind of guy.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That person replied: [Really? His dad, stepmom, and brother all had "accidents." That's one hell of a coincidence.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne stared at her screen, fingers hovering over the keyboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One accident could be karma. But three? That strained credibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had stopped believing the idea that wrongdoers would face consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Vivienne tried: [If he wanted revenge so badly, why is Rebecca still walking around? She's the one who hurt him most.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone replied: [Killing her would be mercy. Making her live with the guilt of killing her family, never knowing when he'll come for her. That's ice-cold revenge right there.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne closed her laptop in frustration. She couldn't convince strangers online, but her gut still said the same thing&mdash;Alistair didn't do this. The car accident, at least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his family members, maybe he wasn't completely innocent there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the genius of it was that everyone knew he might be involved, yet there wasn't a shred of proof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No evidence meant no crime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne had gone with her parents to visit Rebecca's father at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd expected Rebecca to be a complete wreck, but surprisingly, she'd held it together, saying everything was under control with a forced smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they left, they'd seen Richard rushing through the hospital doors.</span><br><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that Rebecca?" her mother, Miranda, asked, following Vivienne's gaze and seeing a familiar figure in the reflection of the television.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne steered her mother away. "Just someone who looks like her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miranda sighed heavily, "God, what a tragedy. A whole family destroyed, just like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now she's back with that Richard," Miranda sighed. "What is wrong with that girl? Sure, he's easy on the eyes, but he's obviously bad news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miranda glanced at her daughter with relief. At least Vivienne was focused on her career, not chasing after toxic men. If she ever brought home someone like Richard, they'd lose their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing her mother off, Vivienne headed toward Viv's Brickhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure suddenly darted out from an alley. Before she could scream, hands pulled her into the shadows. The person yanked off the mask, revealing Rebecca's hollow face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vivienne, I need a favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still catching her breath, Vivienne managed, "What kind of favor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going away for a while. Can you check on my dad sometimes? At the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca rushed to add, "You don't have to go every day. The nurses take care of him. Just... occasionally?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going? If you want my help, you need to tell me that much. Who are you going with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god," Vivienne exclaimed. "You're marrying Richard? Going on some honeymoon? Of course&mdash;he's your son's father, the guy you've been obsessed with for years. Now nothing's stopping you. How romantic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sarcasm dripped from every word. She couldn't help it&mdash;the anger was too raw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd grown up together. Watching Rebecca self-destruct broke her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca lowered her head in silence, appearing to agree, but she also seemed to have some secrets too terrible to voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne's tone softened. "Rebecca, is there something you need help with besides your dad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's head snapped up, and for a moment, Vivienne thought she was about to spill everything. Instead, she forced another smile. "No. Just... check on Dad when you can. Please. You're the only person I can ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca..." Vivienne wanted to respect her choices, but this felt like watching someone walk off a cliff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Richard is bad news. He's not someone you can build a life with. If you're dead set on this because it's what you've always wanted, fine. I'll help you this one last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled in Rebecca's eyes. She lowered her head and turned away quickly, then stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It wasn't Alistair," she said quietly. "My parents... it wasn't him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne froze. "What?"</span></p></div>
