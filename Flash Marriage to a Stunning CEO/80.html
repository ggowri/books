        <h1>Chapter 80 A Bad Mom</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Downstairs in the living room, Cordelia had a pounding headache from Daniel</span><span>'</span><span>s nonstop screaming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time in her life, she genuinely wanted to run away from home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned and glanced at Rebecca, who was sitt</span><span>ing in silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You can</span><span>'</span><span>t keep spoiling him like this. I get it&mdash;hitting a kid isn</span><span>'</span><span>t right, but come on! There are exceptions. Grab a slipper, scare him into shutting up!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca immediately jumped to her son</span><span>'</span><span>s defense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mom, don</span><span>'</span><span>t say that. Danny </span><span>used to be such a sweet boy. And hitting a defenseless child? That</span><span>'</span><span>s </span><span>cruel</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia let out a bitter laugh, equal parts exasperated and furious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Danny was well-behaved because of Alistair. Have you already forgotten? It was Alistair who used to calm him</span><span> down whenever he acted up.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, Cordelia noticed Rebecca's dejected expression. She immediately realized that she shouldn't have brought up this matter, but what had been said couldn't be taken back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia felt </span><span>rather uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she had looked down on Alistair before, at this moment, she couldn't help but wonder how Alistair had managed to get through these five years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca was very protective of her child, and Daniel was really hard to deal wi</span><span>th.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past five years, Alistair had been taking care of Daniel, and he had never once resorted to violence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Daniel had only been living here for a week, and Cordelia, who claimed to have a good temper, was on the verge of using a belt to discipl</span><span>ine Daniel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia couldn't help but sigh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair really has it tough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because of Daniel's naughtiness, it was likely that Alistair wouldn't remarry Rebecca. What's more, Rebecca didn't have a good temper either. Cordelia stole a silent glance at </span><span>her daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she knew it was impossible, Cordelia couldn't help but hold out a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Daniel wasn't Alistair's son, at least Alistair had raised him single-handedly. Cordelia didn't believe that Alistair had any feelings for </span><span>Daniel and Rebecca at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, Cordelia coughed lightly, feeling a bit awkward. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Rebecca, I wanted to ask you this a long time ago. In the past six years, have you and Alistair, well, you know..." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As adults, some things didn't need to </span><span>be made too explicit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The questions that Cordelia could discuss at ease with her friends were not something she could explicitly say to Rebecca.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similarly, Rebecca could share her privacy with her girlfriends, but it was difficult for her to talk about suc</span><span>h things with her mother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca remained silent for a long time and then shook her head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia felt extremely speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Rebecca's insistence on being with Alistair back then was simply to provoke Richard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia found it hard to accept.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cou</span><span>ldn't believe that someone as calm and rational as herself had given birth to someone as foolish as Rebecca.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really wished she could put Rebecca back in the womb.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Rebecca's stubbornness six years ago had already revealed her nature of being in</span><span>fatuated with love.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia and Nathaniel were angry about it, and most of their resentment was directed at Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Rebecca first brought Alistair to meet them, he got battered. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After believing that Alistair bewitched their daughter, </span><span>Cordelia and Nathaniel treated him even more harshly and deliberately made things difficult for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, day by day, Alistair's advantages, such as being steady and reserved, down-to-earth, meticulous, and extremely patient, gradually became apparent.</span><span> Cordelia and Nathaniel began to think that it didn't matter if Alistair came from an ordinary family. As long as he treated Rebecca well, that was more important than anything else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they never expected that just when they finally accepted Alistair, Re</span><span>becca suddenly told them that Daniel had a different biological father.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had actually been just a tool for Rebecca to provoke Richard. And Rebecca's dream lover happened to be Richard, whose parents had poor moral character.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for having a see</span><span>mingly good family background, Richard was inferior to Alistair in every way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, in Cordelia's eyes, Richard, who had a good appearance, was not as pleasing as Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been proved that their decision not to choose Richard at the beginning was</span><span> right. Richard was a coward who only knew how to run away from problems and had no sense of responsibility.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard's coming back to reconcile with Rebecca this time had not been because he had finally had a change of heart and been willing to take on his</span><span> responsibilities. He must have come back for the sake of benefits.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Richard had shown his true colors. But what had made Cordelia regretful was that Rebecca had given up Alistair for such a scumbag. It was really a great loss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia had fel</span><span>t sorry about this matter, let alone Rebecca.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst Daniel's tireless crying, Rebecca had stood up silently and headed up to the second floor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a bad mom, you liar! I don't want a bad mom!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Daniel had seen Rebecca, he had </span><span>wriggled like a caterpillar. His voice had suddenly become shrill, making Rebecca's eardrums throb and buzz.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave me alone! You're bad. I don't want you to be my mom anymore!" Daniel shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had wriggled on the floor like a caterpillar. His hysterica</span><span>l screaming had made Cordelia downstairs cover her chest. She had been so annoyed that she had really wanted to tape his mouth shut.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but sigh again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How on earth did Alistair raise Daniel all these years?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca squatted down and patient</span><span>ly apologized again, "Sorry, baby. It's my fault. I shouldn't have lied to you. Can you forgive me this time? I promise I'll keep my word from now on, okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel grabbed her arm and bit down hard when she wasn't prepared.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excruciating pain made Rebe</span><span>cca scream involuntarily. Almost instinctively, she raised her hand and slapped Daniel in the face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel opened his mouth wide and cried even louder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain in her arm irritated Rebecca's nerves, dampening her maternal love for Daniel. She also forgot </span><span>that she had just been on the moral high ground and claimed that hitting children was barbaric. With a sullen face, she grabbed Daniel, pulled down his pants, and started spanking his fair little bottom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel cried out, "Mom, I'm sorry. I won't cry anymo</span><span>re. Don't hit me, Mom!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, Daniel's hips were red and swollen. Rebecca finally stopped. Holding the sobbing Daniel, she burst into tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't understand why her life had turned out like this. She kind of missed Alistair...</span></p></div>
