        <h1>Chapter 113 Table Turn</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Caleb now works at Emerald Media," Anne gushed. "They're currently collaborating with Director Yves Robinson on a project called 'Mystery Script.' Caleb is managing the entire project and will continue to oversee the film production. It's clear how highly his bosses think of him&mdash;his future potential is limitless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the coffee shop, Rebecca maintained a polite smile on her face, though inwardly she was growing impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for her need to determine whether Caleb had any connection to Alistair, she would never have sat here this long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man Anne had praised carried himself with scholarly elegance. Rebecca couldn't help but notice that his silhouette and build somewhat resembled Alistair's, yet their facial features had nothing in common.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had refined yet masculine features that became more appealing the longer you looked at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb was handsome, but there was a calculating sharpness in his eyes that reminded Rebecca of Alistair's stepmother&mdash;the one who had raised her demand from one million to two million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Anne enthusiastically sang his praises, he maintained a modest demeanor yet kept stealing glances at Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they parted, when Caleb asked for Rebecca's contact information, she provided it without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was certain that Caleb was the son of Celeste, and despite never meeting before, he had clearly recognized who she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, just after returning home, she received a text message from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The message read: [Excuse me, Ms. Whitfield. I'm sorry to bother you, but could we arrange to meet privately another day? I'd like to talk with you about Alistair.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The name "Alistair" hooked Rebecca's heart instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, her real purpose in checking whether Anne's boyfriend was Celeste's son was ultimately about Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She deliberately left him hanging for a while before casually replying: [I'll contact you when I'm free.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she pushed open the door, Cordelia and Nathaniel's conversation drifted out from the study downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How did Alistair gain so much influence? Through what channels did he meet such important people?" Cordelia asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who knows? I wanted to ask more, but he clearly didn't want to talk to me and left shortly after. I couldn't very well chase after him with questions. And Rebecca&mdash;if she had just been a little nicer to him back then, he wouldn't be so cold to me now. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As they say, the tables can turn. I never imagined that the poor boy I once looked down on would someday become someone I couldn't figure out," Nathaniel replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if he experienced some mistreatment in our home, remember that Rebecca gave him a solid two million dollars! Without that money, his father would still be sitting in prison! What kind of job could someone like him find that would earn two million dollars in six years? The ungrateful wretch!" Cordelia exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the mention of two million dollars, Rebecca inexplicably recalled Liam telling her on the phone that Alistair had discovered the truth about what happened six years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam was quite cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He must have learned about her divorce from Alistair and conspired with his greedy wife to somehow extract more benefits from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what if&mdash;and this is just a worst-case scenario&mdash;what if Alistair actually discovered the truth about what happened back then...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca couldn't bear to imagine the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rebecca? Rebecca, come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca walked into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel looked at her gravely. "Are you absolutely certain that before your divorce, Alistair was always hanging around the house with no opportunity to meet other people outside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca bit her lower lip. "Yes, he had no money and only an old phone that couldn't connect to the internet. Plus, I made sure to give him so many tasks every day that he... he simply didn't have an opportunity to go anywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afraid of losing control over him, Rebecca had deliberately consumed all his time, trapping him firmly within the cage she had carefully constructed for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's nails dug into her palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The things she had done to Alistair in the past were so terrible that not only would Alistair hate to remember them, but she herself couldn't bear to think about them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more she recalled, the more terrified she became, and the more convinced she was that she and Alistair could never reconcile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, she viewed Alistair as nothing more than a slave and a trash can. She could freely express any emotion toward him and shamelessly demand that he complete seemingly impossible tasks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Alistair succeeded, it was simply expected. If he failed, he would face her creative punishments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a flashback, Rebecca asked, "Dad, I just heard you talking to Mom about Alistair. What's going on with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel frowned, "The company's business is currently at a bottleneck. Development in our established markets has stagnated, and we urgently need to expand into new areas. Have you heard of Vireon Technologies? They've grown tremendously these past few years and have become a standout among tech companies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wanted to pursue a partnership with them, but I had bad luck today and didn't get to meet their CEO. However, I unexpectedly discovered that Alistair somehow knows the CEO's executive assistant. The two of them seemed quite close."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's eyes suddenly widened. "The executive assistant? Is it a woman? She is about my age, and... and quite beautiful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt incredibly excited. The solution had materialized unexpectedly! So this woman was someone close to Vireon Technologies' CEO&mdash;no wonder she was so arrogant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course Rebecca had heard of Vireon Technologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel looked perplexed. "Julian is a man under thirty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt like a bucket of cold water had been dumped on her. Rebecca was disappointed&mdash;so it wasn't that awful woman after all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least she had some new information now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe that woman was Julian's sister?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps she was acting entitled because her brother worked for a major company?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That seemed entirely possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel's voice grew serious. "If we can successfully partner with Vireon Technologies, it would be a milestone leap forward for our company. Otherwise, we'll keep stagnating. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The competition in our established markets is fierce, and we're gradually being eaten away by competitors. Eventually, the market will leave us behind. We truly must seize this opportunity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weight of Nathaniel's gaze on Rebecca made her feel incredibly pressured. "Dad, I... I can't get in touch with Alistair right now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt completely defeated inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The days when she could casually boss Alistair around now felt like a distant blur, occasionally leading her to wonder if they had merely been an unrealistic dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel's voice carried a hint of disappointment. "I know you don't have his contact information."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his experience, networking often meant opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The CEO of Vireon Technologies is supposedly around your age," he continued. "As I get older, I may have a generation gap with younger people like you. You'd have more in common with someone your age. There's a reception tonight that Ms. Ashbourne is expected to attend. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come with me, and try to introduce yourself to her. It would be best if you could become friends..."</span></p></div>
