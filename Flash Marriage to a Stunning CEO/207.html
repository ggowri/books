        <h1>Chapter 207 Truth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scrawny man perched a pair of glasses on his nose. His hair was such a mess that</span><span> it seemed a chicken could come and nest right on his head. He was wearing crumpled, off-the-rack clothes and sitting awkwardly on the leather sofa. His whole presence clashed horribly with the five-star presidential suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon sat there with a stern fa</span><span>ce, sizing him up in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Derek saw Gordon, he instinctively tensed up. He nervously dropped his head, then quickly lifted it again, looking Gordon straight in the eye. He even forced a calm smile and said, "Hey, Mr. Gordon Ashbourne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordo</span><span>n sat down in front of Derek with a grim face and got straight to the point. "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek grinned. "I thought your first question would be whether I was innocent with your wife back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon curled his hands slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, this was </span><span>what he cared about most. But he just couldn't bring himself to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon didn't want to admit it, but it was true&mdash;he was scared. He was too afraid to face the truth that had been delayed for over a decade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant quietly left, leaving the two of </span><span>them alone in the large room. It was so quiet one could hear a pin drop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek picked up the water cup and then put it down before taking a sip. He looked a bit spaced-out, as if lost in memories from long ago. "I did have a crush on your wife. I was smitt</span><span>en with her the first time I saw her. But I swear, I had no idea she was married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's hand on his leg trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, through the conversation between Derek and Paige and Paige's subsequent compromise, Gordon had already made a </span><span>judgment about what happened back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, there were problems in his relationship with his wife. He always told people it was just a case of falling out of love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in reality, he'd found out that his wife was having an affair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's social st</span><span>atus had given him an even stronger sense of pride than most men. He was deeply hurt. He couldn't understand it, and he'd angrily demanded to know why his wife had betrayed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just couldn't stand the thought of losing to a man who was inferior to him </span><span>in every way. When he first discovered the affair, Gordon was so blinded by rage that he was like a man possessed. He almost laid hands on his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wife, who'd been about to defend herself, suddenly calmed down and simply asked, "You don't trust me? T</span><span>hen let's get a divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon sat still on the sofa, like a statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Across from him, Derek hunched over, tearing at his messy hair in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not like that! It's totally not! Your wife and I, we're innocent! She doesn't even know my name. The first</span><span> time I saw her was when she came to see Paige. I was smitten with her right away and couldn't stop thinking about her. But I felt so unworthy that I didn't even have the guts to talk to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paige noticed how I felt and told me to go for it. She said she</span><span>'d put in a good word for me with your wife. Then, one day, a WhatsApp account with your wife's profile pic added me and asked to meet up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, with malicious intent, in order to punish the non-compliant Lillian, was willing to sacrifice the happiness</span><span> of her own brother. Before Derek arrived, she tricked Lillian into drinking water laced with sleeping pills and then did the same to Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no need to go into what happened next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon had seen his wife lying there disheveled with another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The evidence was right in front of him. What else could she say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since that day, Lillian, who was known to the public as smart, beautiful, gentle, and kind, had disappeared from the public eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, she'd tried to take their daughter away secretly but</span><span> was stopped by Gordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Lillian went abroad alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she would come back a few times a year to see their daughter. But as time went by, her visits became less and less frequent until she stopped coming back altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been twelv</span><span>e years since he'd heard from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a heartless woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she was caught, she just said they should get a divorce and then left. But wasn't he the victim?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she'd never loved him, what about their child? Their child was the one she'd carried for ten</span><span> months. Didn't she even miss her child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon also hated himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years had passed, but late at night when all was quiet, Gordon still found himself thinking about her, recalling every single bit of the happy times they'd shared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The happier they'd been </span><span>back then, the more desperate and enraged he'd felt the moment he'd discovered what he thought was her betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been so furious that he'd almost lost control and killed her if not for a shred of rationality that still held him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the man </span><span>involved in that incident from the past had suddenly appeared, telling him that it had all been orchestrated by his own sister, Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gordon Ashbourne, are you okay?" Derek asked, looking worriedly at Gordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That year, Derek had woken up to Gordon's</span><span> roaring. Confused and panicked about what was going on, he'd rushed out of the door and was hit by a speeding car, breaking his leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news of his alleged affair with a married woman had spread like wildfire. He'd lost his reputation, his face, and his </span><span>job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When everyone was spitting on him and blaming him, and he'd felt like he couldn't go on anymore, Paige, the real culprit, had turned into a kind-hearted and understanding friend. She'd gently told him that she knew he wasn't that kind of person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek</span><span> shook his head in disbelief and said angrily, "I really can't understand how there could be such a vicious woman in the world! You are her brother. How could she do such a thing to your wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon finally came back to his senses. His voice was hoarse a</span><span>s he asked, "Since you were innocent, why did you run away back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek got excited. "In that situation, who wouldn't be scared? I thought I was having a crazy dream. It wasn't until I got hit by that car that I realized it was real."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you wan</span><span>t?" Gordon asked expressionlessly, getting the conversation back on track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek blurted out, "I want you to see what a real snake Paige is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon shot back, "And then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek gawked at him, and as the realization dawned on him, his face twisted into a s</span><span>neer. "I feel so sorry for your wife. I get it, Paige is your blood-sister. And a big-shot like you? You've got women lining up to be with you. Guess you couldn't care less if your wife was set up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the crap!" Gordon roared, his temper flaring up in a</span><span>n instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Derek, who still wore that mocking smirk, and took a deep breath, trying to rein in his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Derek's snide remarks that were getting under his skin; it was the gnawing self-loathing inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no </span><span>question that, just like Derek, his wife had been totally clueless when she was framed back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd tried to tell him what really happened, but he was so mad that he wouldn't even listen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on, when Lillian calmly brought up the idea of a divorce, </span><span>it wasn't because she thought she couldn't clear her name. It was then that she suddenly saw how little trust he had in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a woman with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Lillian saw him for who he really was, she made up her mind right away to end their </span><span>marriage.</span></p></div>
