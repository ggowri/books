        <h1>Chapter 108 Have We Met Before?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes?" Alistair responded sleepily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want you to be honest with me, okay? Don't worry, I won't be upset&mdash;did you ever look down on me before? You know, think less of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Look down on you? Why would I ever do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because back then, in your mind, I was a woman who had already had a child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was bewildered by her question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could someone as remarkable as Caroline truly worry about being judged by others?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was unaware that Caroline was specifically concerned about his judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Based on her observations, Alistair never seemed to look down on her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she needed to hear him express it in his own words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair turned over, sat up on the bed, and pulled Caroline onto his lap, wrapping his arms around her protectively. "You know, I have often contemplated the same question... have you ever regarded me with disdain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline blurted out, "How could I possibly look down on someone as wonderful as you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair asked, "What's so wonderful about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline hesitated for a moment. "Everything about you is wonderful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since the conversation had reached this point, Alistair asked directly, "Caroline, have you met me before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can't call me Caroline in private starting today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I call you then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, of course! Calling me Caroline feels so formal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair remained silent. He sensed Caroline was changing the subject, but he couldn't prove it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey." He complied smoothly, lowering his gaze. "Now can you answer my question? You've definitely seen me somewhere before, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she hadn't successfully changed the subject, the brief distraction had given Caroline time to regain her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't want Alistair to know about her past. "What makes you think that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was straightforward. "When we first met, I got the feeling you recognized me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was secretly surprised. Alistair's perception was terrifyingly accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, she hadn't identified who Alistair was, but she had felt a sense of familiarity, which had led her to trust him in a way that even she couldn't understand at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I did feel like you were familiar when I first saw you," Caroline responded, half-truthfully. "Maybe I'd seen someone who looked like you before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair hesitated before asking his next question. "When you proposed our marriage contract, besides Eloise accepting me, did it have anything to do with you feeling like you knew me from somewhere?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline made a soft sound of agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair felt anxious as he continued, "Have you ever considered that your trust in me might actually come from that person who resembles me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline tilted her head. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She affectionately wrapped her arms around Alistair's neck, blinking her beautiful eyes as she studied his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, are you suggesting that this person was special to me and that you've benefited from his influence on me?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair nodded glumly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't see any problem with his thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What other explanation could there be for Caroline's quick decision to commit to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that he had tasted love, he was hopelessly addicted while simultaneously plagued by insecurity and fear of loss, terrified that one day he would wake up to find it had all been nothing but a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, have a little more confidence in your personal charm! I can tell you with complete sincerity right now that Alistair is the one I love. I want to spend this lifetime with him and make promises for the next life and the life after that. So do you understand? I only have eyes for you, no matter who I met before who looked like you. You're not allowed to think about leaving me! You can only stay obediently by Eloise's and my side. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It must be the sweetest words in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair held Caroline tightly in his arms. "I love you," he said, but these three simple words felt pale and weak, completely inadequate to convey the overwhelming love he had for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing she hadn't eaten breakfast and it was already approaching noon, he knew she must be starving. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simply lifted her into his arms</span><span> </span><span>and went to the kitchen together. "The chicken noodle soup is ready, honey. Try my cooking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dining room connected directly to the kitchen, and as soon as Caroline got there, she caught the rich, distinctive aroma of chicken noodle soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had slept until noon and missed breakfast, so the enticing smell immediately awakened her appetite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her twenty-some years of life, she had never really held any particular food in special regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she had to name one exception, perhaps it would be the pasta Alistair had made for her and Eloise last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that was simply because he had made them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline rested her chin in her hand as she waited with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair quickly returned from the kitchen with a bowl of chicken noodle soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The soup was filled with chicken meat, with celery and carrots floating on top. The soup perfectly embodied a dish that delighted all senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The steaming aroma of the chicken noodle soup wafted toward Caroline, making her stomach growl even louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took the fork Alistair handed her and picked up a piece of chicken. Fighting the rumbling of her empty stomach, she looked at Alistair with her lovely eyes, silently asking why he wasn't eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair pointed toward the kitchen. "I've already served mine in there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned and disappeared into the kitchen, returning moments later to sit across from Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline chewed her food in small, delicate bites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair felt confident about his cooking skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had tasted the soup after it was done, confirming his technique hadn't slipped. The chicken was tender yet still had texture, and the broth was flavorful with just the right amount of salt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it was important to remember that you couldn't win over everyone. While he thought it was good, and it had unexpectedly won Miranda's heart, it might not suit Caroline's taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline ate a small piece of chicken, then scooped up some soup with her spoon. She blew on it gently before drinking it, and a look of pleasure spread across her face. "This is delicious, honey. You're wonderful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deep down, Alistair knew that even if the chicken noodle soup wasn't that great, Caroline would have said it was delicious anyway because she was so understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what could he do? He was just that vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Caroline complimented him directly, he felt like he was floating on cloud nine.</span></p></div>
