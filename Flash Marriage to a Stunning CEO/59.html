        <h1>Chapter 59 The Frightening Truth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he opened the door, a subtle, fresh fragrance greeted him&mdash;some brand of air freshener he couldn't identify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's profoundly dark mood eased ever so slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're back?" A voice called from within the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair froze as he was changing his shoes by the cabinet in the entryway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly remembered that Caroline had still been asleep when he took Eloise to school earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quickly composing himself, he turned and gave her a smile. "Yeah," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, no matter how well he tried to hide it, nothing escaped Caroline's penetrating gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could tell something was bothering him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't look good. Did you not sleep well last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline thought he had actually slept quite well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she'd woken him up from the couch, he'd immediately fallen asleep. It certainly hadn't seemed like he was pretending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline walked over to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was still wearing her pajamas, with every button properly fastened from top to bottom, revealing only her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stopped in front of Alistair and reached out, feeling his forehead before touching her own. "You don't seem to have a fever," she murmured to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair couldn't help but smile. What did she mean by "seem"? There was nothing wrong with him to begin with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A warm feeling washed over Alistair's heart. When people truly cared about you, they noticed even the slightest change in your behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>First it was Eloise, and now Caroline...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was precisely what a family should be like. Even though they weren't actually related by blood, they had still made room for him in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was thinking about what happened years ago... something just doesn't seem right," Alistair said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He refused to call Liam "Dad" anymore&mdash;he would never use that word for him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline brought over a bowl of chicken noodle soup and paused thoughtfully. "Alistair, after hearing about your past that night, I had some thoughts. I don't know if you'd like to hear them..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had a feeling he knew what she was about to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had risen to her high position at such a young age because she possessed a perceptiveness that others lacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a serious expression, Caroline continued, "Don't you think it's too coincidental that Rebecca approached you with that deal right after your father hit someone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Julian had first given her the investigation materials, she'd immediately spotted the issue. She had quietly instructed Julian to dig deeper but hadn't mentioned it to Alistair right away. She'd been afraid he wouldn't believe her, or worse, that he would believe her but wouldn't be able to accept the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Alistair had reached this conclusion on his own, it was the perfect opportunity for her to voice her suspicions and offer her help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had no intention of letting anyone who had ever hurt Alistair get away with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Alistair, when Liam got into trouble, he needed to pay the victim two million dollars in compensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could sell his house for the debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Investigations revealed that Liam owned a three-bedroom apartment of over 1,000 square feet, which could have sold for well over one million dollars at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Liam had borrowed a bit more from friends and family, he wouldn't have needed to pressure his son into sacrificing his promising future by essentially selling himself to pay off the debt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when Liam tearfully explained the situation to Alistair, he claimed the house had been sold at a loss years earlier when Robert fell ill and needed surgery!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He insisted they were only renting their home!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was young and fell for Liam's tears of desperation and helplessness. He truly believed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, according to information Caroline uncovered, Liam actually sold his house six years ago and used that money, plus some additional funds, to upgrade to a larger place in a better neighborhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Where did he get the extra money for the upgrade? Of course, it came from Alistair's sacrifice. It was absolutely outrageous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had always been loyal and devoted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam's "guidance" led him to believe that children making sacrifices for their parents was an inherent part of life. So without hesitation, he sacrificed his future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Caroline didn't dare tell Alistair any of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The timing wasn't right&mdash;if she did, he'd realize she'd been investigating his past!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone would be sensitive about something like that, especially someone as guarded as Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with the best intentions, she couldn't risk it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This information needed to stay buried, completely buried!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you okay?" Caroline asked worriedly after Alistair remained silent for a long time. Caroline feared that the topic had triggered a painful memory for Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair pulled his lips into a smile that was bitter yet somehow nonchalant. "I'm fine," he said, though conflict churned inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The system's electronic voice echoed in his mind. "You suspect there's more to the truth about what happened years ago. You want to investigate and find justice for yourself after enduring six years of suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Option one: Investigate quietly on your own. Eventually, the truth will come to light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Option two: Ask Caroline for help. With her connections and resources, you could uncover the truth about the past more quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Alistair made his choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline wanted to say, "I can help you investigate the truth about what happened back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before she could speak, Alistair jumped in. "Caroline, could I ask you for a favor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline felt her heart leap with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had finally taken the initiative to ask for something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was this a sign that he no longer saw her as an outsider?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell me what you need. If it's within my power, I'll do everything possible to help," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The truth was, she already had all the evidence in her possession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just needed the right opportunity to present it to Alistair in a way that wouldn't seem suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That very evening, Caroline laid out all the evidence in front of Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite being mentally prepared, Alistair felt as if he'd been plunged into an icy abyss when he saw the black-and-white proof that his father had betrayed him. He couldn't stop his body from trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was thoughtful enough to recognize that seeing the evidence would upset him. She took Eloise away to make kites, leaving Alistair alone in her study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stared at the evidence until his eyes burned, then finally looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He leaned back against the chair and closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he opened them again, they blazed with an icy coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six years ago, Liam not only bought a new house but also sent his stepson to study abroad. He certainly showed deep affection and devotion to his new wife and son!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Liam had earned all this through his abilities, Alistair wouldn't have anything to say about it. However, since Liam gained everything by sucking Alistair's blood, how could Alistair not hate him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lost six years of his youth and life in that manner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Liam, that two million dollars&mdash;I'll make you spit it back out exactly how you swallowed it, with interest!</span></p></div>
