        <h1>chapter 12 As a Burden</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was momentarily speechless. "Yes, I do," he finally answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise kept her head down, nervously fidgeting with the hem of her shirt. "Dad, I promise I'll be really, really good from now on. I won't cause any trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The timid little girl in front of him seemed completely different from the cheerful child who had so happily called him Alistair before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong, Eloise?" he asked gently. "Don't be afraid. We're going to be a family now. You can tell me anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His reassurance seemed to give her courage. She looked up at him and asked, "You don't mind that my mom comes with me as a burden?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now it was Alistair's turn to be stunned. He stared at her, completely taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was hard to believe these words came from a little girl who should be carefree and who usually was exactly that kind of innocent child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing her trying so hard to be serious made Alistair's chest tighten with an unexpected ache. He couldn't quite name the painful mix of sympathy and concern he felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who told you that stuff about being a burden?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"At Great-Grandma's house. A lady told me I was a burden and that Mom would never find a husband because of me. She said even if Mom did find someone, he'd only love her money, not her. I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Eloise!" Alistair gripped her shoulders, his expression suddenly serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise looked up at him, confused. That was when Alistair noticed a single tear hanging from her long, curled eyelashes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair knew nothing about Eloise's biological father or Caroline's past relationships. He didn't plan to ask. It didn't feel like his place to pry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked straight into her eyes and spoke slowly, emphasizing each word, "Eloise, you are not a burden. You're our little angel, everyone's little angel! I became your dad because..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He steeled himself for a white lie. "Because I love your mom. And Eloise, do you really think I'm just after money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though, honestly, the allowance Caroline gave him was incredibly tempting. But if it had been Rebecca and her son instead? Alistair wasn't trying to sound noble, but even if Rebecca offered him 100 million dollars a month, he wouldn't go back to that dark, undignified life again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He feared he wouldn't survive to spend it all anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One wrong move and he might drop dead from depression. It was definitely not worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise's eyes widened with excitement. "Then Alistair... no, wait, I mean Dad... will you love my mom forever? Will you stay with her always so she's never alone? Promise?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair told himself this wasn't really a lie. It was just a kind one. He nodded. "Of course."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then let's pinky swear on it!" Eloise held out her tiny pinky finger, beaming with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair wrapped his much larger pinky around her soft little one, making the pledge with all the seriousness it deserved. He felt something light and pure float through his heart, creating gentle ripples of warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Pinky promise, cross my heart, no breaking it ever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair's heart felt like it was soaking in warm lemon water, bittersweet yet comforting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For a moment, he wished he could stay by this adorable child's side forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was only the first day, but he realized that when the time came for him to leave&mdash;and it would come&mdash;it was going to be really, really hard to say goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That evening, Eloise got into bed and fell asleep before ten o'clock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline mentioned that she normally goes to bed very early, no later than nine. Today, she was staying up late only because she was so excited about Alistair being here as her dad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair thought about Daniel, the little tyrant who demanded story after story until his voice went hoarse, never falling asleep before 11. It made him even more certain that Eloise was an absolute angel by comparison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With Eloise now asleep and the housekeepers who handled the cleaning and cooking gone for the day, only Alistair and Caroline remained in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline had changed into loose, comfortable light blue loungewear and settled on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">From her expression, she clearly had something to say to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's Eloise's first day of preschool tomorrow," she said. "I hope you don't mind handling the drop-off and pick-up duties."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was news to Alistair. He learned that Eloise had been quite sickly and had never attended school before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After her recovery and with careful attention, she'd become stronger, and at her own insistence, Caroline had enrolled her in preschool starting tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By coincidence, it was the same preschool that Daniel attended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yesterday, Eloise had been curious about her new preschool, so Caroline had asked one of the housekeepers to take her for a visit. Unfortunately, the irresponsible housekeeper had lost track of Eloise, who then accidentally bumped into Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise's first day of preschool was treated with more ceremony than a college freshman orientation, at least where Caroline and Alistair were concerned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Early that morning, Caroline dressed her in a pretty, comfortable long-sleeved floral dress, carefully braided her hair, and pinned it with sparkling crystal clips. Together with Alistair, they escorted her to preschool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They deliberately arrived early, and were greeted by both the principal and Eloise's teacher, who personally came out to welcome her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Alistair saw the teacher, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief. She wasn't from Daniel's class.<br>Thank goodness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel was thoroughly spoiled and completely out of control. Alistair was summoned to school at least twice a week&mdash;either to hear complaints about Daniel's unmanageable behavior, or to grovel and apologize to the parents of children he'd bullied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Day after day, he kept bending over backwards for the other parents, never standing up for himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had no authority to discipline Daniel, while Rebecca, who never had to face the cold stares and anger from other parents, couldn't be bothered to take Daniel's misbehavior seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If that little monster had actually been Alistair's biological son, he would have spanked him ten times a day until he learned to behave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Eloise had ended up in the same class as Daniel, Alistair would definitely have suggested that Caroline request a transfer to another class.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise was a sweet little princess who wouldn't hurt a fly. If Daniel ever bullied her, Alistair would never let him hear the end of it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After forgetting to pick up Daniel on the first day, Richard seemed determined to make amends. He'd become noticeably more attentive to Daniel, even volunteering to take him to preschool despite his rush to get to the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To be fair, relying on Rebecca to get Daniel to school would probably result in him being late every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She'd grown accustomed to her carefree lifestyle without responsibilities, with no concept of time and sleeping in until whenever she naturally woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel suddenly turned his head, staring in a particular direction. "Daddy! I think I see Daddy over there."</p></div>
