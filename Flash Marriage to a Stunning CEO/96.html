        <h1>Chapter 96 Ugly losers</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron was taken aback, caught off guard by the direct question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair continued, his tone laced with a hint of mockery, "Did she tell you I'm some kind of monster? That I'm a waste of air when I'm alive and a waste of dirt when I'm dead? A bloodsucker, just itching to devour their flesh and suck out their marrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron sank into deep contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being a street thug wasn't merely about being tough, fearless, or having a penchant for violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To rule a territory and survive in this cut-throat world, one had to have a head on their shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, he realized that things weren't as straightforward as he'd initially thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Liam Harlow's so-called ungrateful son looks so mild-tempered and well-behaved. He's the kind of goody-two-shoes that old folks just adore. I could probably take him down with two quick punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, he hesitated to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron knew Liam as a colleague of his father. Despite holding a minor leadership position, Liam's monthly salary was barely enough to support his wife and two sons. They were far from being well-off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six years ago, they'd even exhausted their savings to send one of their sons abroad to study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron had met Caleb and considered him a brother. This was his first encounter with Alistair. And to his surprise, Alistair was nothing like he'd pictured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd heard about Alistair from Celeste and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Supposedly, he wasn't as docile as Caleb and wasn't much of a student. But he'd gotten lucky, though. He'd fallen for a rich girl, gotten hitched, and started a family early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron immediately recognized the designer clothes Alistair was wearing. The entire outfit was worth well over a couple hundred thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron scoffed inwardly.</span><br><span>What else could he be but a gold-digger living off his wife?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, there was something about Alistair's calm composure and self-assured smile that put him on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was evident that Alistair knew exactly who he was and why he'd shown up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron's instincts told him that this young man was no run-of-the-mill character and definitely not someone he wanted to cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Landry, Liam saved your father's life, and you feel you're in his debt. So you've come here to teach his so-called ungrateful son a lesson. But have you ever considered that your so-called act of righteousness might just be playing into someone else's hands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron frowned, picking up on the hidden meaning in Alistair's words. "Cut the crap and get to the point," he snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief. "You&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a panicked yell interrupted him, "Alistair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam had sprinted all the way here, his heart thumping so violently it felt like it was about to leap out of his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he reached them, he tried to pull Alistair to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair nimbly sidestepped, giving Liam a half-grin. "You made it just in time, Mr. Liam Harlow. Don't worry, I haven't spilled the beans yet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Liam heaved a massive sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair leaned in and murmured something only he and Liam could catch, "There are less than six days left. I really wanted to keep my promise and stay calm, but what is this all about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shot a glance at Aaron, and his smile instantly turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron furrowed his brows, eyeing Liam and Alistair suspiciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't make out their conversation, but he sensed that Alistair was on the verge of spilling some beans, and Liam was petrified of it getting out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron's mind raced.</span><br><span>Does Liam have some skeletons in the closet that Alistair knows about, and it seems to involve me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What a pair of "loving father-son" act...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze was intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam shivered when he met Aaron's inquisitive stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he could, he'd never want to lay eyes on Aaron again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guilt gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam had clung to hope. After Alistair cut off all ties with them, he'd gone all out to track Alistair down in New York, but it was a wild-goose chase. He'd assumed Aaron would face the same dead end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who could've ever guessed that little brat would show up back in town today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thankfully, Liam had pulled out all the stops to find Alistair. He'd reached out to every acquaintance in places the boy might frequent, asking them to keep a sharp eye out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the call came from the owner of the local grocery store, Liam sped back in his car like a bat out of hell. He'd arrived just in the nick of time. If he'd been any later, he might not have lived to see another sunrise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forcing a smile, Liam said, "Sorry, Aaron. You must be having a good chuckle at my expense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron knew Liam was trying to brush him off, but he wasn't one to be easily deterred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a respectful look on his face but a steely determination in his stance, he demanded, "Mr. Liam Harlow, what's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A bead of cold sweat trickled down Liam's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd always had a rocky relationship with Celeste, the woman who'd goaded him into selling Alistair. At that moment, he could have gladly ripped her to shreds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That old hag is trying to get me killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the mounting pressure, Liam pulled Aaron aside. Relieved to see that Alistair didn't come charging after them, he let out a little sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That makes sense. That five million dollars hasn't hit his account yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And come on, I'm his real dad. He wouldn't really screw me over, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam couldn't help but drift back to the old days when Alistair was the most obedient and caring kid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That boy was an absolute angel before. He knew how to take care of folks...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How come I never saw his good side back then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frustration got the better of him, and he gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn that woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Liam didn't get was that if he hadn't been such a cold and irresponsible father to Alistair, Celeste's words wouldn't have driven a wedge between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam was dying to get rid of Aaron. As long as Aaron was out of sight, he figured he still had a shot at patching things up with Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he'd forgotten that their father-son bond was history. He'd never hear Alistair call him "Dad" again in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forgive him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Liam," Alistair spoke up calmly, his voice devoid of any extra emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to Liam, it was like the chilling call of a vengeful spirit. And the cherry on top? Aaron, the real-life Grim Reaper, was standing right there in front of him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Up on the second floor of the shabby two-story building, Caroline stood by the window, looking down at the composed man on the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline beamed with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's so handsome. My hubby takes the cake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe it was just love making her blind, but Caroline thought Alistair was perfect in every way. She couldn't get enough of looking at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After feasting her eyes on her husband's gorgeous face for a while, Caroline reluctantly shifted her gaze to the others present. The moment she laid eyes on those two, she felt as if her eyes had been contaminated. She squinted slightly and let out a disdainful snort. "Ugly losers."</span></p></div>
