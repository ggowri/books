        <h1>Chapter 219 The Demon Group</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The success of The Adventures of Elle the Little Fairy caught everyone off guard. The newly established production company, Feather Films, </span><span>originally created for If </span><span>There's a Next Second, decided to ride the momentum by launching a movie adaptation of the animation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Eloise's request, the film was to be gifted to all children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, it was no longer a casual birthday project A</span><span>listair had cooked up by hiring a few animation students to make a short series to make Eloise smile. The movie required professional-level visuals and a polished, compelling story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the professionals took over the production. Alistair's job was to expa</span><span>nd and refine the original story into something bigger, better, and more enchanting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Eloise was the heart of the project, Alistair turned to her for ideas&mdash;creative, wild little sparks that only a child's imagination could generate. When he submitted </span><span>the final script, he made sure the writing credits included one very special name&mdash;Eloise Ashbourne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo, on his own initiative, offered to oversee the film's music. Alistair didn't hesitate for a second and welcomed him on board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was just a </span><span>matter of waiting for the animation to come to life and dreaming about the day it would hit the big screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn faded into winter. The New Year was just around the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>New York had one of its rare snowfalls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair spent the afternoon buildi</span><span>ng a giant snowman with Eloise at the playground. When it was almost time for Caroline to come home, she sent him a text saying she'd be late due to "something that came up".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She specifically reminded him that she wouldn't be able to take phone calls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alis</span><span>tair frowned as he read the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Leo!" Eloise suddenly shouted, her voice full of delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo jogged over, scooped her up, and tossed her in the air. "Eloise, you're basically a snowball now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was blood ties or simply Leo's shameless</span><span> habit of showing up every few days, his bond with Eloise had only grown deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Leo, you're not wearing enough. Aren't you cold?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nope. I'm tough," he said with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she first started calling him Uncle Leo, it used to sting. But over time,</span><span> he got used to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uncle or not, it didn't matter. He had no right to compete with Alistair and Caroline for custody. As long as Eloise was healthy and happy, that was enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise took his hand and led him to admire the snowman she and Alistair had bui</span><span>lt. Leo noticed the tension in Alistair's expression and asked quietly, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair patted Eloise's fuzzy hat. "Keep an eye on her for me. I've got something to take care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was more than happy to oblige. "Don't worry. She's in good hand</span><span>s. Be safe out there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't call Caroline. Since she had made it clear she couldn't answer, he chose to respect that, but he did call Julian, trying to probe a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, he got nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, that didn't ease his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline usual</span><span>ly called him directly. Only when she was at work and couldn't speak would she text. But today's message had come at the end of her workday. Why wouldn't she just call?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't seem like a big deal, but something about it gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, Carolin</span><span>e never went anywhere without bodyguards. But he'd confirmed that today, she drove herself. No security detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would she deliberately send them away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically, Alistair had no reason to panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already activated a Safety Card for her&mdash;a protective</span><span> service that guaranteed her personal safety for one full year. Once it expired, he could always renew it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That thought helped him breathe a little easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Safety Card active, nothing should be able to touch her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he couldn't shake the </span><span>question.</span><br><span>What is she hiding from me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever it was, it had caught her off guard. She had to deal with it immediately, and she had chosen not to involve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It reminded him of the time she'd secretly gone to meet a blackmailer for his sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing terr</span><span>ible had happened in the end, but the memory still made his chest tighten. Why did she always try to face everything alone? Why did she still think she had to protect him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he wanted&mdash;what he needed her to understand&mdash;was that he wasn't just her partner </span><span>in love. He could be her anchor, her shield, and her home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline slammed the car door shut and stared up at the dull, crumbling house in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A battered iron gate creaked in the wind. Standing just beyond it was a woman in her mid-forties</span><span> to early fifties&mdash;Lorraine Hargrove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Caroline with a faint smile. "You've gotten taller. Prettier, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline didn't bother with pleasantries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for this woman, she'd be home by now, having dinner with her family, and maybe helping E</span><span>loise build another snowman before bedtime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze flicked to the roof of the house, where snow had settled thick and white against the fading daylight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped forward, voice flat. "Where is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine didn't move. She looked her up and down and </span><span>sneered, "What happened to all those rules I taught you? Seems like you've forgotten everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's face darkened. Lorraine wasn't a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was one of the people who had "disciplined" her back when she was twelve years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't waste my </span><span>time," Caroline said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine let out a sigh. "Alright then. Let's speak your language. You're a businesswoman. If you want something from me, you need to offer something I find... persuasive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lorraine raised one finger and grinned. "O</span><span>ne hundred million. Come on, Ms. Ashbourne. That's nothing for someone like you. If I asked for less, I'd be insulting your status, wouldn't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline didn't respond. She knew Lorraine wasn't done. And she was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more thing," Lorraine added, al</span><span>most conversational. "We want Professor Paige Ashbourne released."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline let out a short, bitter laugh. "She must be something special. You and your little crew really worship her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just her&mdash;Caroline knew that now. Lorraine wasn't acting alone</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She represented an entire group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had baited Caroline with something from her mother's past. The demand was clear&mdash;come alone, or the item would be burned to ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no question who was behind it&mdash;Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, that woman had managed to get wo</span><span>rd out. She'd told her followers what was happening to her behind closed doors in that institution. They couldn't touch Gordon, but Caroline? She was a viable pressure point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, to get Paige out, they baited her, and Caroline bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Caroline </span><span>hadn't expected was this&mdash;years ago, when Paige had stormed into her room and cleared it out&mdash;claiming she was destroying everything that might "corrupt" her&mdash;she had spared one item, a wooden box her mother had left behind.</span></p></div>
