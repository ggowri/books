        <h1>Chapter 78 Caring for the Sick</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair and Caroline turned off</span><span> the lights and went to bed on time at ten o'clock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't sleep soundly. Soon, he realized the reason for his restlessness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the darkness, he heard heavy breathing and couldn't help becoming more and more awake.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had spent five stressfu</span><span>l years caring for a baby, who'd grown into a mischievous but healthy kid. By now, he knew that heavy, rapid breathing all too well&mdash;it gave him an instant stress reaction. Why? Because whenever the little troublemaker got sick, his already tough life turne</span><span>d into a total nightmare.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair turned on the table lamp. The light of it was warm yellow and wouldn't be too dazzling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the thin blanket, Caroline curled up into a ball, and her face took on an abnormal crimson color. Without even taking her </span><span>temperature, Alistair could tell that she was indeed sick.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind by the lake in Chicago was very strong. Maybe she caught a chill at that time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair couldn't help but feel upset. He had clearly noticed that something was wrong with her before going </span><span>to bed, but he didn't give her any medicine beforehand. If he had taken precautions in advance, Caroline wouldn't have had a fever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair got out of bed to look for the first-aid kit and took her temperature first. After seeing that her body temperature</span><span> was 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, he hurried to get the medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feverish and dazed Caroline barely opened a slit in her eyes and showed a triumphant smile as she looked at Alistair's back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't been sick for a long time. During the last influenza </span><span>outbreak, many people around her, including Eloise, were infected, but she was fine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline thought she had a strong immune system. She was even a bit worried that just taking a cold shower couldn't make her sick, so she literally stood under the icy spr</span><span>ay longer than usual&mdash;on purpose&mdash;and finally managed to catch a bug. Honestly, she was kinda thrilled it worked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One terrible thing about this trick was that it would disturb Alistair's sleep well in the middle of the night and make him take care of </span><span>her. But she saw no other way. Without resorting to this trick, she couldn't confirm Alistair's sexual orientation or whether he was interested in her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair came back. He put down the water cup and the pills first and then bent over to help Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Huh?" Caroline looked at him in a daze. Her eyes misted over, giving her an adorably dazed look.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline, having a fever, was like a pitiful and adorable doll, which had nothing to do with the efficient and decisive company president she usually was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You</span><span>'re sick. I'll help you sit up, and you can take the pills first," Alistair said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gently helped her sit up and lean against the headboard and then handed the water cup to Caroline. Caroline looked at Alistair with her hazy big eye</span><span>s.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Alistair directly held the water cup to her mouth. This time, Caroline finally cooperated. She obediently opened her mouth and took a sip of water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Alistair realize that he had forgotten an important step before asking her to drink wate</span><span>r, which was to put the pills in her mouth first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It doesn't matter. When someone's sick, they should drink more water anyway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While thinking this, Alistair picked up the pills and motioned for Caroline to open her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used the way of coaxing a child</span><span> to take medicine without even realizing it. Fortunately, Caroline was still very cooperative.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair put the pills in her mouth and then quickly asked her to take another sip of water. Finally, he managed to feed her the medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, have a good </span><span>sleep. Maybe you'll feel better tomorrow." Alistair covered her with the quilt and tucked the corners in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline obediently closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair went out again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly thought that Eloise had also been exposed to a lot of wind, so he was a bit </span><span>worried about her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Alistair tiptoed to Eloise</span><span>'</span><span>s room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he confirmed she was fast asleep and perfectly fine, a wave of relief washed over him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He returned to his room. But just as he lay back down, he heard a faint, muffled groan from Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He le</span><span>aned toward her, concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Are you feeling unwell?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline mumbled something, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair leaned in closer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What is it? What</span><span>'</span><span>s wrong?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I</span><span>'</span><span>m cold</span><span>...</span><span> so cold</span><span>..."</span><span> she murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he heard her </span><span>clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out and touched her forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s burning up. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Must be</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> a fever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People running a temperature often felt cold.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Alistair reached for his blanket and gently pulled it over her, covering half her body.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>blanket was wide enough&mdash;they could share it without either of them freezing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But given her condition, he figured he probably wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t be getting much sleep tonight.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was fine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking care of her came first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Alistair was about to get up, Carolin</span><span>e turned over. He felt a wave of heat, and then Caroline dazedly burrowed into his arms and reached out to hug his waist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was stunned. He felt as if a ball of fire had gotten into his arms and was about to burn him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stiffly carried out his orig</span><span>inal plan and pulled half of the thick blanket over Caroline. He asked somewhat awkwardly, "Are you still cold now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline rubbed her head in his arms and let out a vague moan. Soon, she settled down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't dare to move. Caroline was already u</span><span>ncomfortable and having a hard time falling asleep. He was afraid that if he moved, it would make her even more uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, the medicine took effect. As her fever broke, Alistair felt her skin cool&mdash;slippery, like melting ice in his pa</span><span>lms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline sweated a lot, soaking her clothes. Alistair, who was closely hugging her, was also soaked in her sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's body was sticky. Caroline held him tightly. Their skin was closely pressed together through two layers of thin pajamas, and th</span><span>e sticky touch made Alistair have the illusion that they were glued together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even though he was certain that Caroline's temperature had subsided, he still maintained his motionless posture.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline was sleeping soundly at this moment. Sufficient</span><span> sleep was helpful for the recovery from her illness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair leaned against the headboard and napped for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tense nerves relaxed as Caroline's fever subsided. He was so sleepy after almost staying up all night that he accidentally fell asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to his shame, he had a wet dream about Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair woke up in great surprise. When he opened his eyes, he saw Caroline waking up in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind went blank. In his extreme shame, he didn't understand why he hugged Caroline and fell as</span><span>leep.</span></p></div>
