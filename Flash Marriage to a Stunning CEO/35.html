        <h1>Chapter 35 The Sneaky Woman</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline naturally couldn't answer her grandmother's question since she herself didn't understand it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She couldn't say that it was because she felt a sense of familiarity with Alistair that made her plunge headfirst into it, wholeheartedly marrying Alistair without any complaints or regrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It sounded like she was cursed by someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she said it, maybe her grandmother would arrange an exorcism ceremony for her in the afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline never thought about the magic stuff. It was all nonsense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew very well that it was her inner impulse that drove her to make the decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline was thoughtful.<br>I've been too busy in the past two days. Besides, I've just "tricked" Alistair to get the marriage certificate. Now that I have it, I want to spend more time with him, so I have to put the matter of going to Chicago aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For some reason, when Chicago was mentioned, she felt an inexplicable resistance in her heart. However, according to her recollection and the information she got from others indirectly, she had never been to Chicago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Compared to other people's answers, Caroline believed in himself more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she lost a year's memory...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel was certain that the man who was favored by her granddaughter must have some extraordinary qualities that were unknown to others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she never expected that after Caroline told her all about his background, Mabel almost suspected that there was something wrong with her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What did you say? He dropped out of high school and was divorced once!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel's eyes widened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel thought that Alistair looked quite good, but she didn't expect his background to be so terrible. Not to mention being a good match for her beautiful granddaughter, worth tens of billions of dollars. It was God's mercy that he was not single.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel actually liked Alistair very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wouldn't look down on anyone casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she still hoped that the one who stood next to her outstanding granddaughter in the future would be equally outstanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if the man was not as good as her granddaughter, who was known as a genius, he should at least be almost as good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair's conditions were far from those of her granddaughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel thought they could hardly be called a match.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's expression turned calm. "Grandma, if you think he is not good enough, I can raise Eloise alone for the rest of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was not a threat but a statement of fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, Caroline was talking about this in front of Mabel on purpose. It was impossible to ask her to give up Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline sat down next to Mabel and leaned against her, as if she had returned to her childhood. "Grandma, I'm not a child anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel touched Caroline's face lovingly and snorted, "Yeah, my granddaughter has grown up and has been a mother to someone else for five years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's voice was soft. "So Grandma, please trust me, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She left out the rest of her words.<br>Trust my eye for choosing men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel didn't speak for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone would want their children to be well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel just felt that her perfect granddaughter deserved the best man in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't think that Alistair was a bad person, but it was a fact that he didn't have a decent background, and he didn't even go to college.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel didn't have as many concerns as Julian, so she asked directly, "Carol, are you possessed? You are so excellent. Why do you have to find a divorced man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grandma!" Caroline's helpless tone carried a hint of sweetness. "Don't forget that I have a daughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel asked, "So what if you have a daughter? You're still a virgin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Beneath the seemingly weak appearance, she was stubborn and would not listen to anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel sighed, "Oh, forget it. I said too much, and you think I'm nagging. I don't have too many requirements. As long as you are happy, it doesn't matter if his conditions are a little worse. Anyway, our family is rich and powerful, and we don't expect him to earn money to support the family. As long as you can live a good life, that's enough..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this point, Mabel couldn't help but feel a little depressed.<br>Is that just a little bit worse? It's simply impossible to find someone with a worse background than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But if he treats you badly," Mabel snorted, "then I won't be nice to him. It will be useless no matter how much you protect him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline smiled, "Don't worry, Grandma, this day will never come."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I didn't believe in Alistair, would I let him live in my home with us?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Although I don't know where my trust came from, I just trust him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the garden, when the wind blew, a few petals fell down scatteredly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was so beautiful that it seemed like a paradise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair took out his cell phone. Eloise was picking up petals from the ground with great interest. When she saw Alistair's camera pointed at her, she quickly made a few poses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair took a lot of photos of her, some of which he took accidentally and some of which she made poses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian threw the orange in his hand and said with a smile, "You get along pretty well with Eloise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair created a new album for Eloise to store her photos. "Eloise is very well-behaved and sensible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian nodded in agreement. "Yeah, she is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Caroline brought Eloise back, she was very small and always timid when looking at others. She would cry when anyone approached her except Caroline. For Eloise, Caroline dropped out of school and took care of her day and night. That was how the cute girl grew up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But since Alistair came, Julian found that Eloise was becoming more and more lively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian received a call, signaled to Alistair, and walked away while answering the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, can you show me the photos?" Eloise ran over to look at the photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as she ran to Alistair, she saw something, and her expression suddenly changed. She subconsciously hid behind Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair became alert and turned his head to look to the left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A middle-aged woman appeared in his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The woman put her hands in her pockets with a slightly panicked look and looked away as if nothing had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Apart from relatives and friends, the only people who could enter Mabel's manor were the nannies who worked there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">From the way the woman was dressed, Alistair guessed that she might be a nanny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes fell on her pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he guessed correctly, what she put in her pocket should be a cell phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A bold and absurd speculation came to Alistair's mind that the woman was secretly filming them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair felt it was unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was not a star, so why would the woman take pictures of him?</p></div>
