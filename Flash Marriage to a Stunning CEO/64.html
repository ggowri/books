        <h1>Chapter 64 Old House</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline didn't even blink. "Oh really? What a coincidence."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave a wry smile. He didn't push.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They passed through a neighborhood that hadn't aged </span><span>well&mdash;rows of old, gray buildings lined up in irregular clumps.</span><span> </span><span>Even in spring, the place looked tired.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His childhood home had been sold off years ago, back when Liam had decided to settle in New York.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when Alistair and his grandfather had begun re</span><span>nting instead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam had spun it well at the time. "I'll make it big in New York. Once I've got enough money, I'll bring you both over to live the good life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right. Great speech. Never happened. They'd never even spent a single night in Liam's new home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In</span><span>stead, Liam had sold Alistair, pocketed two million&mdash;and left them behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair let out a short, bitter laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">All it took was a silver tongue and some crocodile tears, and he fooled us both.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, is this where you grew up?" Eloise asked, eyes wide, </span><span>taking in everything around her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair nodded. "Yeah."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's so cool! I know even more about you now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few blocks ahead, they passed a house covered in white ribbons and floral garlands, with a big sign out front reading, "Congratulations to the new</span><span>lyweds!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair recognized the groom&mdash;they had gone to the same school, a troublemaker who'd started "dating" a girl in fifth grade.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His steps slowed. His gaze darted toward Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he remembered correctly, Liam and the groom's father had once been s</span><span>worn brothers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course Liam would be back in town for the wedding.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline noticed the shift in his expression and smiled. "Honey, I wanted to do something for you. I didn't ask for your permission first. I hope you're not mad."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair forced back </span><span>the knot forming in his chest and shook his head. "Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised an eyebrow, amused. "There you go again, being all Mr. Polite."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wedding reception was being held at a local hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When relatives who'd arrived late asked for the location, they </span><span>turned toward the venue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, usually at Caroline's side, had the day off&mdash;rare for a man paid well above the industry standard and used to being on call.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Caroline had insisted on driving herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the car jolted to a stop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline was a steady driver&mdash;smooth, calm, consistent, just like her demeanor. Sudden braking didn't fit her style.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The road was clear. No pedestrians. No animals darting across.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sat up straighter, scanning the area.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he saw it&mdash;a run-down old </span><span>house.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The house directly across from it had belonged to a neighbor back when he was in junior high.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The original family had sold the place and moved away years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered that soon after, a new family had moved in&mdash;two adults and a child. But he ne</span><span>ver once saw the kid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors swirled. People whispered the child was sick, that they'd moved here from the city for peace and quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had been warned to stay away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he needed the warning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never once caught a glimpse of that child. By the </span><span>time he left for high school in New York, the house had become background noise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise, too distracted by the excitement of the day, didn't notice the sudden change in Caroline's expression.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair did. Caroline had gone pale. Her eyes were locked o</span><span>n that house, as if it had reached out and grabbed her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned and leaned toward her. "What is it? What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The building before her struck a nerve, like a hook snagging a box deep in her mind&mdash;on</span><span>e packed away for years.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of memory tore across her thoughts, barely formed, but sharp enough to sting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Alistair had wondered earlier&mdash;why drive so far to fly a kite when New York offered so many closer options?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth was, Caroline hadn't p</span><span>icked the location on a whim. She'd had her reasons.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, she knew Liam would be here today, attending a friend's son's wedding. She wanted Alistair to have his shot&mdash;to confront him, face to face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second... she had her own suspicion. Something </span><span>irrational, something buried so deep she hadn't dared name it until now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd hoped the visit would prove nothing, that her hunch was just that&mdash;a far-fetched theory.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, she found a thread. A thread she couldn't unsee.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to grip the wheel l</span><span>ike a lifeline, or she might've passed out right then and there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Carol?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's voice pulled her back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked, steadying her breath. By the time she looked back at the building, the fear and pain had drained from her eyes, replaced by something c</span><span>old. Not hollow&mdash;but reborn. Ruthless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who truly knew Caroline would've recognized that look immediately. Someone was about to pay.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at him through the rearview mirror and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just low blood sugar."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair reached into his pocket an</span><span>d pulled out a piece of candy&mdash;something he usually kept for Eloise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he peeled the wrapper and leaned forward to hold it to her lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She met his gaze, eyes unusually soft, and opened her mouth to take it. Her lips brushed his fingertips</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A jolt shot through Alistair like static, catching him completely off guard. He pulled his hand back too quickly, wiping it discreetly on his pants.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell was that?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline put the car in park and said, "Let's get some air."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it was just </span><span>an excuse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stepped out first and then lifted Eloise from the back seat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sun was sharp, already hinting at summer's burn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Caroline, despite the heat, felt a chill in her bones.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair pointed behind the house across the street. "That used</span><span> to be my place. Right over there."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline kept her tone light. "Do you want to go see it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, a little smile tugging at his lips. "No. It hasn't been mine for a long time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she said nothing else&mdash;just stood there in silence, </span><span>staring at the weathered house, saying more with her stillness than words ever could.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, they got back in the car and headed off to find lunch. Right across the street from the restaurant was the wedding venue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the celebration was well </span><span>underway. Caroline chose a table by the window, perfectly positioned. They ordered slowly, deliberately, taking their time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair barely touched his food. His eyes were too busy&mdash;darting between the restaurant entrance and Caroline, watching her closely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked composed, but something in her was restless. He could tell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, the reception wrapped up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guests began trickling out, laughing and chatting in small groups.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair waited.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And finally, there he was&mdash;beaming, slightly rounder than </span><span>before, and as self-satisfied as ever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam... his father.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair couldn't remember how long it had been. It felt like a lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing beside him was a woman with too much makeup and tightly curled hair&mdash;Celeste Harlow, Alistair's stepmother. Charmin</span><span>g. Sharp-tongued. Manipulative.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she'd first married Liam, people had said Alistair was lucky to get such a kind stepmother.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not like those horror stories from fairy tales.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, even Alistair believed it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But n</span><span>ow? Not a chance.</span></p></div>
