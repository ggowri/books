        <h1>Chapter 225 Happy Forever</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day marked the start of </span><span>the new year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aggressive marketing campaign had paid off. Before the Music Fades, produced by Stellar Films, brought in a massive 200 million in box office revenue on its opening day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It immediately surged ahead of every other film released the same da</span><span>y.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moviegoers were buzzing with excitement. Stellar Films threw a lavish celebration party, and the cast flooded social media with posts celebrating the film's success. Glowing praise for Before the Music Fades saturated every platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same tim</span><span>e, a very different kind of voice started emerging online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One user wrote that they had spent the entire day watching both Before the Music Fades and If There's a Next Second. The first movie was their personal pick, since they were a die-hard jazz fan. Bu</span><span>t to their dismay, they had fallen asleep midway through the opening act and didn't wake up until the end credits rolled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their girlfriend, on the other hand, was a Leo fan and insisted on supporting If There's a Next Second, since Leo had performed the th</span><span>eme song. The user begrudgingly agreed to watch it with her, fully expecting to sleep through the whole thing again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once the movie started, they stayed wide awake and sat through the entire two hours without so much as a bathroom break, too afraid to </span><span>miss a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was that good&mdash;high energy from start to finish, not a single boring moment. The film left them so fired up that they were already planning to see it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Replies started pouring in under the post.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some accused the original poster of bei</span><span>ng a paid shill for If There's a Next Second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But others quickly came to their defense, saying they had watched it too and agreed completely. The film was genuinely impressive and well worth the ticket price. In contrast, despite its star-studded cast, Bef</span><span>ore the Music Fades felt forced and messy, and some performances came off as painfully overacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The post exploded, spreading like wildfire across the internet and igniting a clear divide between the two camps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, who was both a producer and screen</span><span>writer for If There's a Next Second, didn't pay any attention to any of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spent the first day of the new year entirely with his family. He hadn't even looked at his phone, let alone bothered to check the movie's real-time earnings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the </span><span>film passed the ten-million mark, it was Yves who told him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it passed thirty million, it was Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At fifty million, Aaron broke the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it hit sixty million, it was Caroline who brought it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like everyone around Alistair cared more</span><span> about his cinematic debut than he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On opening day, If There's a Next Second brought in 65 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, it didn't compare to the numbers Before the Music Fades had pulled, but for a low-budget indie film with an all-rookie cast, it was more than resp</span><span>ectable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the audience had come for Yves or Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair himself also had a certain appeal&mdash;people were curious about how someone who had once stood at the center of a media storm could handle himself with such calm. That curiosity alone was enough </span><span>to bring some viewers to the theater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On New Year's Day, Alistair, Caroline, and Eloise went to the movies too&mdash;but not to see If There's a Next Second. They were there for The Adventures of Elle the Little </span><span>Fairy,</span><span> the film Eloise had been dreaming about for</span><span> weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise sat between her parents, glancing around the packed theater, eyes wide with delight. "Daddy, so many people came to see your movie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair ruffled her hair with a smile. "It's your movie too, remember? A lot of the fun ideas in it came fr</span><span>om you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline leaned over to gently pinch her rosy cheek. "You're amazing, sweetie."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lights dimmed, and the film began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the opening scene, the theater echoed with laughter. As the story unfolded, soft sniffles started to rise from the crowd. A</span><span>listair knew right then and there that the movie was going to break even, no problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the final scenes, even Eloise was crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way out, a little boy tugged at his father's hand and asked tearfully, "Daddy, will Elle always be this happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise</span><span>, who was resting on Alistair's shoulder, immediately lifted her head. "Yes! She absolutely will!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew better than she did because she was Elle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might be young, but Eloise understood everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair leaned in and whispered in her ear, "Tha</span><span>t's right, sweetie. You're going to be happy forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise's tears vanished into a grin. She kissed Alistair on the cheek, then turned, and kissed Caroline too. "We're all going to be happy&mdash;forever and ever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the second day of the new year, Leo</span><span> was cornered at </span><span>Ashbourne</span><span> Manor by Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked pitiful as she pleaded, "If you could write a theme song for some stranger's movie, why not write one for mine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when Before the Music Fades was in development, Giselle had wanted Leo to be </span><span>the film's music director.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had rejected her flatly. No room for negotiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, when she heard rumors that Leo had composed and performed the theme song for If There's a Next Second, she didn't believe them. She assumed they were fake, for Leo </span><span>and Caroline didn't exactly get along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had liked Leo for years, but the truth was, she didn't know him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, Leo was cold, aloof, and impossible to approach. She thought he treated everyone the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Leo only acted that w</span><span>ay toward people he had no interest in, especially the ones who wouldn't leave him alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the film premiered, she finally realized everything she had heard was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was already halfway out the door, eager to leave. He had promised to take Eloise </span><span>skiing today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With growing impatience, he said, "You've got it all wrong. Alistair isn't 'some stranger'. He's my cousin's husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle looked like she might cry. Without Paige backing her anymore, Leo had become more and more dismissive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And one mor</span><span>e thing," Leo added, seizing the moment to be perfectly clear, "stop feeding the press those rumors about us. There's nothing going on, and there never will be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?" Giselle bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's tone remained cool. "Because you and I don't belong in t</span><span>he same world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then his expression shifted into something rare&mdash;an actual smile, one that Giselle had never seen before. "Eloise, sweetheart," he said warmly, "I thought I was picking you up. What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle turned and saw Caroline walkin</span><span>g in with Alistair and Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before going skiing, Eloise wanted to say hello to Mabel. Leo had brought her inside, leaving Caroline and Alistair at the door with Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still nursing the sting from Leo's rejection, Giselle turned her frustration toward</span><span> them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well," she said with a tight smile. "I heard If There's a Next Second pulled in 65 million? Not bad. Sure, it doesn't hold a candle to </span><span>Stellar's</span><span> big-budget productions, but for newbies, that's pretty solid. If you ever need guidance, I'd be h</span><span>appy to share some industry tips."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline barely glanced at her. "Honey," she said to Alistair, "let's go inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hand in hand, the two of them walked right past Giselle like she wasn't even there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle stood frozen. "What's the big deal? Just a bunc</span><span>h of amateurs who got lucky!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she didn't see coming was that the so-called amateurs were about to leave her in the dust.</span></p></div>
