        <h1>Chapter 34 Do You Know Evil Magic?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian introduced himself. "Hi, I haven't formally introduced myself to you yet. My name is Julian Hart. I'm Ms. Ashbourne's driver and assistant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian rubbed Eloise's head, looked at Alistair with a smile, and continued to speak, "My father is Madam Ashbourne's driver. I have lived here since I was a child and grew up with Ms. Ashbourne."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair understood what it meant.<br>Well, they are childhood sweethearts. No wonder Eloise is so close to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair vaguely saw some warning in Julian's friendly smile. Julian seemed to be warning, "You better not have the intention to bully Carol. Otherwise, I will not forgive you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair smiled and met Julian's gaze, "Hi, glad to meet you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair thought that if he had a younger sister and she suddenly brought a stranger of unknown origin, his reaction would probably be more intense than Julian's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed that both Julian and Mabel were calm on the issue of Caroline's sudden marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was obviously related to Caroline's usual decisive and arbitrary attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They all seemed to have gotten used to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed that Caroline was usually a very independent and decisive person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a rare opportunity to stay with Alistair alone, so Julian had a lot of things to ask Alistair, such as how they met and what was so special about him that made Carol look at him differently. Julian only dared to think about these questions in his mind and did not dare to actually ask them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He admitted that he was a coward, especially being in front of Caroline. She warned Julian that her husband liked quietness and asked him not to bother him. Even if Julian was tortured to death by his own curiosity, he did not dare to ask any more questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian shook his head.<br>Oh, I'm really jealous of Alistair. Alistair is the first person who can be protected by Caroline to this extent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian could remember Alistair's background clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was originally an excellent student with the prospect of being admitted to a good university. However, to pay off his father's debts, he was willing to marry into the Whitfield family and work tirelessly for 6 years as a househusband. He was not valued by anyone and had no status in the family. When his ex-wife's beloved man came back, she even kicked Alistair out of the house overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then he met Caroline...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They got married the very next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And it was said that it was Caroline who took the initiative to mention getting the marriage certificate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian admitted that when he learned about Alistair's experience, he felt a sense of sympathy for Alistair. Anyway, if it were him, he would not be able to hold on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair appeared to be cowardly and incompetent, but in fact, he was patient and tenacious. Julian admired him very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Caroline simply wanted to find a father for Eloise, Julian could understand it. After all, Caroline had revealed this idea to him before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Caroline told him yesterday that she was serious and wanted to spend her whole life with Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If someone else had said this, Julian might not have taken it seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But since these words came out of Caroline's mouth, Julian would have to take them seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I know Caroline too well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She would never speak casually without thinking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is she possessed by something to spend her whole life with a man she has only known for three days?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, Julian made a bold and terrifying guess.<br>Could it be that Alistair knew some kind of evil magic?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian couldn't hold it back and directly asked, "Buddy, there's no one else here. Can you tell me honestly whether you know something that others don't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, look! There are many flowers. Wow, it's so beautiful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise looked at the colorful scene in front of her and said excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair looked back at Julian with a confused face. "Huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian let out some dry laughter. "Nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was dragged by the excited little girl and ran toward the sea of flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The wind blowing over carried a faint scent of flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, Mabel and Caroline were the only ones left in the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Carol, tell me the truth. You don't want to go on a blind date and want Eloise to have a father, so you deliberately find someone to make a show for me, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel looked at Caroline with a serious face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for seeing them holding hands, which had excited her earlier, Mabel knew it was just something Caroline did intentionally to make the fake look real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, this naughty girl. Once she starts to go against the norm, it becomes a headache for everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Caroline insisted on adopting Eloise despite everyone's opposition, even though everyone proposed several plans for her own good, such as finding a wealthy and warm family for Eloise or simply having Mabel raise her, all of the suggestions were rejected by Caroline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was determined to raise Eloise herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though she was just a child in the eyes of others at that time, she still insisted on being a mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline took an orange and played with it in her hand. She said frankly, "I've definitely had this thought before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel keenly caught the keyword "before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel asked, "Are you serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grandma, when I meet the right person, can't I be serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel sighed in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She couldn't win the argument with Caroline at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tell me, how long have you known each other? I haven't met him before, so it must be only a short time. Only time can reveal a person's true character. How can you be so impatient? Is he..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel wanted to ask if Alistair had deceived her with his sweet words, but then she thought that it would be the same as suspecting that her granddaughter was blind in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With her sharp eyes, she felt that Caroline was not that kind of person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It wasn't long," Caroline said softly. "But Grandma, you should understand that time cannot explain everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel had a complicated expression on her face as she thought of something. She hesitated for a long time before finally sighing, "Carol, if you think I control you too much, I will let things take their own course and won't arrange blind dates for you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline replied, "Grandma, I told you this has nothing to do with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel thoughtfully asked, "So it's related to Eloise? Carol, I know that you will never look back on what you have decided, but I still want to say that marriage is not a joke. You feel sorry for Eloise, but you also have to think more about yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline emphasized. "Although I really want Eloise to live in a healthy family atmosphere like a normal child, Grandma, you must know that only a man who satisfies me can be Eloise's father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel asked curiously, "So can you tell me what is so special about that guy?"</p></div>
