        <h1>Chapter 106 Hold Him Accountable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise's eyes widened in surprise. "You like pink ropes! I love pink too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline leaned over and whispered in Alistair's ear, "Honey, are you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her warm breath tickled his ear, sending a strange tingle through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair resisted the urge to touch his ear and glanced at her. "So, what color are you going to pick for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline smiled, "Didn't you already choose pink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the soft light, her lips looked like shiny jelly, so tempting that Alistair couldn't help but be drawn to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's heart skipped a beat. "Actually, I'm not picky. Any color will do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline made the final decision. "Then pink it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at around ten o'clock that night, instead of a pink rope, Caroline presented Alistair with a frilly, baby-pink lace nightgown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On her, the nightgown made her look like an eighteen-year-old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cute yet sexy style, so different from her usual plain and conservative clothes, gave Alistair a strong visual shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she emerged, Alistair's eyes met hers. Instantly, his throat tightened, a dry gulp bobbing in his throat, and his mouth went as dry as a bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The enclosed space was filled with the warm, fragrant air, which only intensified the already amorous atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline, seemingly oblivious to the alluring ambiance she had created, poured herself a glass of water. Taking a sip, she then sat on the bed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pulling the corner of the quilt over her abdomen, she tucked her legs up slightly. Her toenails were neatly trimmed, glistening delicately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leaning against the headboard, she turned to look at Alistair in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under her gaze, Alistair felt a bit uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All his wild thoughts evaporated in an instant because Alistair was certain that the look Caroline gave him was one of accusation, as if she were gearing up to hold him accountable for his deeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sitting up straight nervously, Alistair asked, "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline said coolly, "That Vivienne, your ex-wife's best friend. Does she have a crush on you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was taken aback. "Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, realizing what she meant, he exclaimed in horror, "No, absolutely not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I can't believe she's having such thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There's no way there could be anything between Vivienne and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure, she</span><span> </span><span>was a lovely girl, but considering her connection with Rebecca, and the differences in our social standing and other aspects...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Come to think of it, the gap between Caroline and me was even wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then again, in life, anything could happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline continued to press the issue. "Then why did she comp our meal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair suddenly got it.</span><br><span>Ah, so that's what's bothering her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He explained, "Carol, her mom was in the hospital once, and she had the chicken noodle soup I made. That was when I was still married to Rebecca. She asked me to make it, and her mom loved it. Then, on her mom's birthday, Vivienne was at a loss about what to give her, so she asked me to cook a birthday dinner. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She must be thanking me. She wanted to pay me 100 thousand dollars, but I turned her down. Maybe she felt she owed me one and decided to waive our dinner bill as repayment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline asked, "Then why did you agree to cook for her mom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair replied, "She'd helped me out before. I thought it was no big deal, so I said yes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline nodded, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair felt he'd been as honest as he could be. He wondered what he'd said that didn't satisfy her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe it's because I had contact with my ex-wife's bestie?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it had already happened, and there was no changing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it would make Caroline feel better, he wouldn't mind promising to never see Vivienne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline suddenly asked, "Is your chicken noodle soup really that good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She tried to imagine it but couldn't quite picture it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's just chicken noodle soup. Is it really that unforgettable? Now I'm curious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, I want to try it too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was simple enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as there were hens around, Alistair could make it for her every day if she wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But tonight was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It would take too long to prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll make it for you tomorrow!" Alistair promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline hugged him. "You're the best, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As her tense nerves relaxed, a flurry of thoughts rushed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The night deepened, and their heartbeats grew erratic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their bodies, pressed together, grew warmer and warmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sweat plastered their clothes to their skin, leaving them sweltering and desperate to rip the garments off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone's lips found the other's first&mdash;clumsy, awkward, and not at all cooling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, it was like tossing a spark onto dry kindling. A huge flame shot up, quickly consuming their reason. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the heat of the moment, only one thought remained&mdash;tonight, they had to have each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the critical moment, Alistair suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline lay on the bed, her hair disheveled. In the dim light, Alistair couldn't see her usually composed, stunning face, now flushed and flustered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She tried to sound calm as she said, "The second drawer in the nightstand..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That short sentence drained her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thank goodness the lights were off, or she would have wanted to dig a hole and bury herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Preparing condoms made her feel forward and unladylike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he doing this on purpose? Why hasn't he prepared in advance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be fair, it wasn't entirely Alistair's fault. He lacked experience and couldn't be expected to think of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline didn't have experience either, but she'd been reminded by her pregnant assistant, who had taken leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair paused for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline, thinking he didn't understand, felt too embarrassed to explain clearly. In her frustration, she lightly punched his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she raised her hand for a second hit, Alistair caught her small hand and gently kissed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heat of his lips sent a shiver through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Letting go, Alistair leaned over and fumbled in the dark to open the second drawer, pulling out a small box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His heart pounded wildly. It was his first time using condoms, and the combination of nerves and darkness left him sweating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline lay still, shy and anxious, waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they embraced again, the world seemed to spin, their senses blurred, and it felt like a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside, the rain began to fall softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their heartbeats steadied, they drifted off to sleep, wrapped in each other's arms.</span></p></div>
