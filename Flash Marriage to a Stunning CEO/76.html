        <h1>Chapter 76 No Feelings for Her?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time ticked on, Caroline's whole body started burning up, not just her face. She felt like she was about to spontaneously combust.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wasn't faring much </span><span>better. He was a young, healthy guy, after all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could think about was that soft, warm body he'd held. The image was stuck in his head like glue, and he couldn't get rid of it no matter how hard he tried.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wanted to get up and head to the bal</span><span>cony for some fresh air, or maybe splash cold water on his face in the bathroom. Actually, a full-on cold shower sounded even better. But his body felt like it was made of concrete. He was too afraid to even twitch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so embarrassed. He'd bragged to C</span><span>aroline about being a perfect gentleman. And look at him now&mdash;one accidental hug, and he was a mess.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started questioning himself big time. The more he thought about it, the worse he felt. But weirdly, all that self-doubt actually cooled his hot-headednes</span><span>s. Eventually, he talked himself into feeling okay.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Well, it isn't all my fault. She's so soft, and I'm only human. People should judge me by what I do, not what I think. I'm still a decent guy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that sorted in his head, he drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearin</span><span>g his slow, steady breathing, Caroline felt deflated. She couldn't help but wonder what was wrong with her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she was attractive, and plenty of guys had chased after her. So why did Alistair seem so uninterested?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd hugged tonight, for crying ou</span><span>t loud! Wasn't he supposed to feel something?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline was smart, good-looking, and from a good family. This whole situation was driving her crazy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What's the problem? Am I just not his type?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it hit her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart jumped into her throat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What if... Wh</span><span style="font-style: italic;">at if Alistair isn't into women at all?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, Caroline's flustered feeling vanished, replaced by pure panic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he liked women but not her, she could still try to win him over. She could figure out his type and change up her look or personality. </span><span>But if he wasn't into women, she was totally out of the picture.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd already decided he was the one for her. Even if he was gay, she was dead-set on changing his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair got up, Caroline did too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One look at the dark circles under her </span><span>eyes, and Alistair's mind flashed back to their midnight collision and the unwanted stir it caused in him. His heart, which he thought had settled down after a night's sleep, started pounding all over again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to ask if she'd slept badly but held b</span><span>ack. No point&mdash;those puffy, shadowy eyes said it all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair felt like a total idiot. It was his fault for not watching where he was going. If he'd paid more attention than just the bed, they wouldn't have crashed into each other like that. Now things wer</span><span>e so awkward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She must be mad about it. Why else would she look so tired?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stole glances at Caroline, she pretended to casually check him out too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He seems wide awake and fresh. It makes sense. He slept like a log until morning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did she know? She'</span><span>d spent the whole night tossing and turning, obsessing over whether Alistair liked women. She was half-asleep but still noticed every little thing about him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline felt all mixed up. Part of her was relieved he didn't seem bothered by what happened. But</span><span> another part stung when she realized he didn't seem to care at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does he really not feel anything for me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to think being smart and capable mattered more than anything. She hated the idea of pleasing men or using her looks to get ahead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now</span><span>, the first thing she did after waking up was rush to the bathroom mirror. Suddenly, her appearance mattered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl in the mirror stared back, confused. She knew she was pretty&mdash;people had been telling her that since she was a kid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, she never gave</span><span> those compliments a second thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What good are looks anyway? They can't buy food or respect.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since she was little, she'd learned that real smarts and skills were the only things that guaranteed a good life. She refused to be a pretty face who need</span><span>ed a man to get by.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But people change.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she figured that while looks couldn't replace hard work, if she happened to be Alistair's type, winning him over might actually yield twice the result with half the effort. He was the only one she wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wanted to apologize to Caroline, but she acted like everything was normal. He could pretend nothing happened, sure, but so could she.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bringing up what went down that night would just make things awkward again. By the time breakfast rolled around, </span><span>he still hadn't decided whether to say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline suddenly said, "I'm moving Eloise to a different kindergarten. Starting next Monday."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" Alistair blurted, then glanced at Eloise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise was having breakfast. She looked up and said, "Mommy tal</span><span>ked to me about it, and I'm okay with it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Won't you miss your teacher and your new friends?" Alistair asked. He couldn't help worrying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise had just gotten used to the old place. Starting over at a new kindergarten meant doing the whole "making friend</span><span>s" thing again, and that seemed tough on her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Technically, according to their agreement, he had no say in family matters. Caroline was already being nice by giving him a heads-up. But lately, he'd been forgetting his place, unconsciously acting like Eloise</span><span>'s dad and thinking about things from her perspective.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise thought for a second. "It's all good, Daddy. Even if we don't see each other every day, we'll still be friends. And I can make new ones at the new school."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sighed quietly and turned bac</span><span>k to Caroline. "Why the sudden change? She was happy at the old kindergarten." He had an idea why but didn't want to sound like he was reading too much into it, so he held back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline shrugged. "No big deal. The new kindergarten is ours. I'll feel bette</span><span>r knowing she's in our own place."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Our kindergarten... It must be nice to have that kind of money.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was secretly relieved he hadn't blurted out if the transfer was because Rebecca's son went to the old kindergarten and she was </span><span>worried about future trouble. That would've been embarrassing and presumptuous.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, he wasn't totally wrong&mdash;Caroline did have that in mind.</span></p></div>
