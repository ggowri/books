        <h1>Chapter 155 Professor Paige Reed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stellar Films operated under Reeves Group and was home to some of the biggest names in entertainment. The company had launched countless careers and claimed nearly half of the country's annual box office revenue, making it the most influential film production company in America.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no wonder people often referred to Giselle as a princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her birthday party took place the night after Leo's fourth concert. In previous years, she had always celebrated on a private island, but this year, in an unprecedented change, she chose New York as the venue. When asked by the media why she made the change, Giselle simply smiled and declined to answer. But the reason seemed obvious. It was to accommodate Leo's concert schedule in the same city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guest list for Giselle's birthday was predictably glamorous. Along with Stellar Films' top talent, the guest list was filled with high-profile figures from all corners of society, many of whom came bearing lavish gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a fellow heiress from that rarefied circle, Caroline received an invitation from the Reeves family every year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had never once attended. Socializing wasn't her thing, and she preferred to send a gift through Julian just to check the box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This year, however, she made an exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The part of her memory that included the incident with the box her mother had left had been erased during that year she lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to worry Alistair, or perhaps simply unwilling to let him see the more vengeful side of her, Caroline casually told him she had an evening engagement and would be home by nine-thirty at the latest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After picking up Eloise, Alistair brought her over to Mabel's for dinner. Just as he stepped out of the car, he got a call from Yves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves explained that he was heading to Giselle's party. Since Stellar Films was a major investor in If There's a Next Second, they had invited the entire creative team. As the screenwriter, Alistair was on the guest list as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel gently asked if it was work-related and encouraged him to go. She would take care of Eloise for the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair thought it over and then agreed. He changed into something more formal and went with Yves to the private estate where the party was being held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate was enormous. As soon as they arrived, Yves was swept up in conversation with someone who had arrived at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair recognized him immediately&mdash;he was the newly crowned Best Actor of the Year and also the lead in If There's a Next Second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had been lucky. His first official script had caught the eye of a rising young director, and the production had landed an all-star cast. With a celebrated director, a major production budget, and a lead played by a national favorite, even if the script had been mediocre, the project would've still drawn attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves took the opportunity to introduce Alistair to the actor. The man offered a brief nod, cool and reserved, and then turned back to his conversation with Yves without missing a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't take it personally. He knew where he stood. As a nobody just breaking into the industry, it wasn't surprising that he was treated like background noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They made their way toward the venue. As they walked, the crowd grew thicker&mdash;men in crisp tuxedos, women in dazzling gowns. The scene looked less like a birthday party and more like a high-profile entertainment gala, the kind of event one usually only saw on television or in the headlines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair kept his expression neutral while glancing around. He wasn't gawking. Well, maybe he was, just a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never attended something on this scale before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, none of the opulence or celebrity meant anything to him. What he cared about wasn't the people or the decor, but the chance to spot someone specific in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his instincts were right, Caroline was here too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the real reason he agreed to come tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That morning, he had seen her reading the headlines about Giselle. She hadn't said a word, but her expression had been cold, distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't entirely sure what it meant, but he had a feeling he would find out soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sent her a quick text.</span><br><span>Alistair: [Babe, I'm at a party with Yves tonight.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he added a second message right below it.</span><br><span>Alistair: [I'll be home before nine-thirty too.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he hit send, a sudden, excited cheer erupted nearby. He looked up, calm and unhurried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, the usually aloof Mr. Best Actor had dropped his cool fa&ccedil;ade, now smiling politely as he shook hands with a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves leaned in and whispered an introduction, "That's Professor Paige Reed, Leo Reed's mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he glanced sideways. "You do know who Leo is, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course he knew who Leo was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't feel the need to flaunt that connection, let alone the fact that he had punched the guy not too long ago. He had no interest in proving how "close" he was to Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to boast about anything, it would be Caroline or Eloise. They were the only people worth showing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair turned his gaze toward Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked to be in her early fifties. Her features bore a clear resemblance to Leo's, and her skin was impeccably smooth&mdash;evidence of meticulous self-care. There was an intellectual pride in the way she carried herself, something typical of people in academia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had looked her up before. Paige was a respected scholar, a professor at New York University, and the current chair of the National Endowment for the Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Yves greeted her with a warm smile, he gestured toward Alistair. "This is the new writer we brought on during the last project. Smart kid, very talented."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige gave him a polite smile and nodded in greeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just from her appearance, she looked every bit the kind and composed intellectual. No one would have guessed she was the same woman who had tightly controlled every aspect of Leo's life like a puppet master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair knew better. No matter how harmless or graceful she appeared, he couldn't feel the slightest fondness toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had seen firsthand what she had done to Caroline and Leo. He knew what she was capable of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything she showed the world was a carefully crafted illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath that polished veneer was something darker, something suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had wondered what Leo's reaction would be once Caroline fulfilled her promise and told him where Miley had gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't close, and Alistair certainly didn't feel any sense of kinship just because Leo and Caroline were technically family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But still, he couldn't help feeling sorry for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They continued toward the main venue, stopping here and there as Yves exchanged greetings with nearly everyone they passed. Alistair trailed behind by half a step, unnoticed and unbothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The actor turned to Paige and asked where Leo was tonight. Paige replied with a gentle smile that he had been exhausted from performing four concerts in a row. He had spent the whole day resting at his hotel, but she had just spoken with him and confirmed he was already on his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone tapped Alistair on the shoulder&mdash;firm enough to be intentional, but not enough to hurt.</span></p></div>
