        <h1>Chapter 50 Rebecca's Disappointment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bye, Daddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the kindergarten, Eloise waved goodbye to Alistair, her pink backpack bouncing as she turned away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair watched until her tiny figure disappeared from view, then turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing was believing. Cordelia's last shred of hope vanished as she watched Alistair climb into his Maybach and drive away. So it was true. He really did have an adorable little daughter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cordelia had deliberately taken on the task of dropping off her grandson today to investigate the situation herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides "accidentally" running into him at the kindergarten, she had no way of contacting Alistair, who used to be at her beck and call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd arrived early to drop off Daniel at kindergarten, then lurked nearby waiting for Alistair to show up. Sure enough, her patience paid off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cordelia had called Rebecca last night and learned that she and Richard had split up. When Cordelia had hinted about Rebecca returning to her previous life, Rebecca's silence had spoken volumes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cordelia had been thrilled. She'd already convinced herself that if Rebecca was willing, Alistair would surely come crawling back. Not to toot her own horn, but someone like Alistair could never find such favorable conditions on his own, not in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe Rebecca had a temper, but she was their only daughter. Everything they owned would eventually go to her. If Alistair just behaved himself and stayed with their daughter, he would be set for life with wealth and luxury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had no education or skills to speak of. His ability to even survive in society was questionable. Rebecca's willingness to reconcile and remarry him should have been considered a blessing, something he ought to be grateful for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cordelia believed that if Rebecca approved, Alistair would definitely come around. Even if he got married again, it wouldn't concern her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her mind, their family was wealthy, Rebecca was perfect, and Alistair would come running back at the slightest beckoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cordelia's inflated sense of self-importance stemmed from her complete misunderstanding of Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even a begging dog wouldn't sit still while someone tried to slip a leash around its neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Alistair, the Whitfield family had been nothing short of hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having finally crawled out and gained the dignity to live on his own terms, he would never go back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When self-assured Cordelia actually saw Alistair, she immediately realized how delusional she'd been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His confident demeanor, stylish appearance, and mode of transportation all proved he was doing exceptionally well, infinitely better than he ever had with the Whitfield family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cordelia didn't even have the courage to talk to Alistair anymore. She returned home with a heavy heart, only to find Rebecca waiting to apologize, which just made her more anxious. Poor Daniel was truly going to grow up without a father now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rebecca, there are plenty of jerks in this world," Cordelia said. "It's not scary to meet one. What matters is recognizing them and walking away. There are plenty of fish in the sea. You'll definitely meet the right person someday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew exactly why Cordelia had personally taken Daniel to preschool today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd been waiting hopefully for Cordelia to return with news that Alistair had changed his mind, that they should work things out and stop this nonsense. But Cordelia's complete silence about Alistair after specifically going to see him made Rebecca realize something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Was Alistair refusing to forgive me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca bit her lip hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to ask but was too embarrassed. She'd never taken Alistair seriously before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she was the one who had kicked him out like garbage. Desperately asking about him now would feel like lowering herself, even though Alistair had visibly risen in status and wasn't the same man he used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kids couldn't hide their feelings. When Alistair picked up Eloise that afternoon, he noticed something was bothering her, though she insisted nothing bad had happened at preschool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Eloise got home, she dropped her backpack and pattered down the hall to Caroline's room, then to Alistair's, before trudging back to her own room with a cloud hanging over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was bringing in laundry from the balcony when he decided to check on her. Finding her slumped motionless at her desk, his heart clenched.</span><br><span>Is she sick?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He approached gently. "Eloise, are you feeling okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her shoulders trembled with silent sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair went into full dad-panic mode.</span><br><span>She just said she was happy, then why is she crying alone in her room?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eloise, talk to me. What's going on?" he asked, kneeling beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slowly, Eloise lifted her head and threw her arms around his neck, breaking into loud, heartbroken sobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's anxiety skyrocketed. "Hey, don't scare me like this, okay? Did someone at school mess with you? Just tell me who, and I'll make sure they answer for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Between hiccups, Eloise managed. "N-nobody was mean to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Caroline arrived home from work. Spotting Eloise's tear-stained face, she rushed over without even taking off her coat. She shot Alistair a questioning look, but he could only shake his head helplessly. He was just as confused as she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears rolled down Eloise's rosy cheeks as she asked in a trembling voice, "Dad, Mom... are you guys fighting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair and Caroline exchanged bewildered glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline gently wiped away the tears on Eloise's cheeks and asked with surprise, "Daddy and I get along great. Why would you think we've been fighting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise's long lashes fluttered, sending teardrops rolling down her rosy cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hiccupped through her sobs, "You're lying to me, Mom! You did fight with Dad. You just don't want me to know, so you're both pretending!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was completely thrown. "What? I've never lied to you, sweetie. What makes you think Dad and I had a fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise clenched her tiny fists. "If you're not fighting, why do you sleep in different rooms? All my friends' parents sleep in the same bed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was equally lost for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise continued crying, "Today Zoe told me her parents only sleep in different rooms when they're mad and fighting with each other. So you must be secretly fighting behind my back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Um, that's not it, Eloise," Caroline tried to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sobbing, Eloise threw herself into Caroline's arms while firmly gripping Alistair's middle and index fingers. His hands were too big and hers were too small. Usually Alistair's large hand held her tiny one, but when Eloise wanted to hold his hand, she could only manage to grab a couple of fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, Dad," she whimpered, "what if you keep fighting and end up getting divorced?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Five-year-olds understood more than they might think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That won't happen, we&mdash;" Alistair wanted to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" Eloise wailed. "Daddy, Mommy, don't get divorced! Don't leave me!"</span></p></div>
