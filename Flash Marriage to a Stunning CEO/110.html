        <h1>Chapter 110 Homemade Lunch</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca suddenly developed an intense interest in Anne's boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She enlarged the photo of Anne and her boyfriend, then studied it obsessively like some kind of stalker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne's boyfriend had unblemished skin with a gentle, scholarly demeanor. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wore thin, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose, exuding strong academic vibes&mdash;the perfect sweet, puppy-like guy that Anne had recently become infatuated with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca stared thoughtfully at the man in the photograph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She remembered that Alistair's stepmother, Celeste, had a son. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six years ago, when she went to make a deal with Liam, that greedy woman had pulled Liam aside while he was still indecisive. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Rebecca waited for them to reach an agreement, she looked around out of boredom and spotted a family photo on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It showed a happy family of three, but the young man nestled between his parents wasn't Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca vaguely recalled hearing the name "Caleb" from Celeste's lips back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her heart suddenly skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A strange thought crossed her mind&mdash;surely the world couldn't be that small, could it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were so many people with the surname Harlow out there. Maybe she was just being paranoid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca sat lost in thought for a long time. Before she realized what she was doing, she had already dialed Anne's phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a spacious, well-lit office, Caroline ended her call with Ivy, set her phone aside, and took a sip of coffee to perk herself up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come in," she called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian pushed the door open. "Ms. Ashbourne, Mr. Whitfield has been waiting in the reception area for half an hour. Would you like to&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline set her coffee cup aside and retrieved the top file from the stack in front of her, without looking up. "Which Mr. Whitfield?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Mr. Whitfield from Whitfield Group," Julian replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline looked up, and Julian added, "Rebecca's father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's expression remained impassive. "Tell him I'm busy. If he wants to keep waiting, that's his choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian hesitated. "Ms. Ashbourne, I think he's come with genuine intentions. Whitfield Group also meets all our company's requirements..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline nodded. "I see. You're reminding me to keep personal and professional matters separate? Are you suggesting that I should set aside my prejudice against him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the first time Julian had discovered Caroline's stubbornness in business matters, and he couldn't just ignore it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Caroline was known for her decisive and efficient management style, she wasn't completely autocratic. She was willing to listen when someone offered objective and fair suggestions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline rested her elbows on the mirror-like desk surface, her chin propped on her interlaced fingers. With a lazily defiant expression, she candidly admitted, "That's right, I'm absolutely settling a personal score."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me put it this way," Caroline cut in. "If Whitfield Group satisfies my thirst like a bottle of water, then my husband serves as the beating heart within my chest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian was speechless. Why did he suddenly feel like an outsider?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just received a generous portion of romantic bliss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian surrendered. "Alright, alright, I get what you mean. Whitfield Group is replaceable, but your husband is one-of-a-kind in this world, right? So this grudge&mdash;you absolutely must settle it on your husband's behalf, correct?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline gave a cool, slight nod. "Exactly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian pondered for a moment. "Did Alistair ask you to do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's eyes flashed with indignation. "What kind of person do you think he is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian smiled, "I knew it. Alistair isn't the type to let success go to his head and forget where he came from."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline couldn't hide her pride. "Of course not. He's the man I chose, after all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian checked the time. "What do you want for lunch? I'll make arrangements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline didn't appreciate his offer. "No need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're not eating? Food is essential fuel, and skipping meals will leave you famished. If you won't eat, I'm calling your grandmother to tell her about your cold from the other day! It's only been a few days, and you're already neglecting your health. You need to put on some weight to boost your immunity, you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This man could be just as insufferable when he started nagging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline silently covered her ears, refusing to listen to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing she wasn't budging, Julian had a sudden inspiration. "Fine, your grandmother is elderly, and I don't want to worry her. But I have Alistair's contact info! I'll call Alistair and let him deal with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline rolled her eyes. "He is bringing me lunch today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The previously chatty Julian fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline leaned back comfortably in her chair and emphasized with smug satisfaction. "A special homemade lunch, personally prepared with love just for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Well, he had worried for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She already had someone who cared for her&mdash;why would she need his meddling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had truly embarrassed himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian plastered a fake smile on his face. "I hope you enjoy your meal, Ms. Ashbourne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline smiled softly, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her phone screen lit up with a text message from Alistair: [Food's ready. I just left home; should be there in about 10 minutes.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline replied immediately: [Okay, drive safely.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the reception area, Julian apologetically addressed Nathaniel, who stood expectantly in his tailored suit. "I'm sorry, Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield, but Ms. Ashbourne's schedule is completely booked today. She won't be able to meet with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel masked his disappointment with a casual smile. "I should have called ahead instead of dropping by unannounced. When might Ms. Ashbourne have some availability? I'd like to take her to lunch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian couldn't exactly tell him that Caroline would never have time for him, under any circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He replied, "Ms. Ashbourne's calendar is quite packed these days. How about this, Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield&mdash;when she has an opening, I'll contact you in advance. Would that work?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel felt uneasy. Being a seasoned businessman himself, he easily caught Julian's underlying message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, unwilling to give up such a valuable opportunity, he chose to ignore his suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Bentley slowly approached the curb downstairs at the company building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel glanced over casually and saw the back door open as Alistair stepped out carrying a thermal food container.</span></p></div>
