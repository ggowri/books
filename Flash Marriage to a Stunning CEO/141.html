        <h1>Chapter 141 Ignored</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Eloise's feet touched the ground, she clutched two of Alistair's fingers with her chubby little hands, not because she didn't want to hold more, but because her tiny hands could only manage two.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her grip was firm and urgent as she whispered, "Daddy, we need to hide! I'm not scared of him, I just don't want him to come over and steal you again! Hurry, Daddy, find a hiding spot!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair couldn't help smiling. The urgency in her eyes, the sweat on her brow... it was both funny and heartbreaking.</span><br><span>Is she really that scared of losing me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise was tugging him toward the crowd, whispering fiercely, "Mommy's not here, so I have to watch you. If some other kid takes you, I won't have a daddy anymore, and Mommy won't have a husband either. That's a huge problem. A really, really huge problem!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's chest tightened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">God, I love this kid.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he make her understand that he wasn't going anywhere? That she never had to worry about being replaced?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must not have made her feel as safe as he thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her scanning the crowd frantically for a hiding place, Alistair gently stopped her and crouched down to her level. "Don't be scared, Eloise," he said softly. "As long as I don't want to leave, no one can take me away."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, a voice called out behind them, "Alistair?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard had just bought Daniel a robotic puppy from a toy store. When he noticed the boy staring fixedly in a certain direction, he followed his gaze and saw someone he never expected to run into. A familiar figure, one that made his stomach twist.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Rebecca, who still looked completely out of it, he asked, "Danny, do you miss your old dad?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel clutched the toy in his arms, his expression tense. After a long pause, something like hatred crossed his face. "I don't miss him. He didn't want me. Now he's someone else's daddy. I hate him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard grinned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Good boy. Seems he has taken my lessons to heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, for reasons even he couldn't explain, Richard raised his voice and called out, "Alistair!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca flinched like she'd been shocked. The second she heard that name, her body jerked upright. She immediately scanned the street and locked eyes on him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were plenty of people around, and Alistair wasn't the tallest man in the crowd. But something about him made him stand out like a beacon. Rebecca's eyes found him with ease.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There he was, Alistair, holding a little girl in his arms, looking back in her direction.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their eyes met, Rebecca was filled with a panicked sense of shame. She looked down at herself. No makeup, casual clothes, a complete mess. She looked awful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He can't see me like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she knew Alistair despised her so much that he wouldn't look twice at her even if she were radiant, her pride still screamed in protest. She didn't want to be seen like this. Not by him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair spotted the trio across the way and felt a twinge of surprise. The city wasn't exactly small, but running into familiar faces in a crowd was more common than people liked to think.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised him more wasn't that he saw Rebecca.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was that she was walking with Richard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca realized it too, and panic flashed across her face. She opened her mouth, wanting to say something, explain something... but nothing came out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who is he to me anymore?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no right to explain herself. Alistair didn't care. He wasn't trapped in the past like she was. He wasn't haunted by six years of marriage, wasn't desperate for even a shred of what they once had.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a wife, a daughter, and a life. And she? She'd only just realized that the future she'd dreamed of, one with redemption, hope, and second chances, was just a fantasy. A cruel illusion. She was still shackled by the past, drowning in regret and sleepless nights.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca stood frozen as Richard led Daniel toward Alistair. Her brain was spinning. She knew she looked like a wreck, but her feet moved forward anyway.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe... maybe I just wanted to see him. Just once.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair watched the three of them approach. He felt the little girl in his arms tense up like a cornered animal.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise clung to him, face set in a serious frown, like a tiny pink-eared warrior guarding her territory. Her eyes scanned Richard, Rebecca, and finally landed on Daniel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel scowled at her. The two children locked eyes, silent but clearly engaged in some invisible contest of wills. It didn't last long. Daniel's expression cracked first.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His scowl faded. His eyes dropped. He looked up at Alistair, lips pressed together, and for a moment, there was no hatred in his face, only confusion and longing. The quiet, aching gaze of a child still searching for warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't understand what had happened. Why Alistair, his dad, had suddenly become someone else's dad. Why he didn't come home anymore. Why he didn't walk him to preschool or pick him up like he used to.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Alistair was gone, Richard started hitting him. Nathaniel was mean. Cordelia barely looked at him. Even Rebecca had changed, yelling and hitting, always angry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Alistair had ever been kind. He didn't want Rebecca anymore. He didn't want Richard either. He just wanted Alistair back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair had a new family now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's eyes welled up, but he held it in. If he cried, Richard would hit him. Rebecca might, too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him, Rebecca fidgeted with the hem of her shirt, her nerves fraying.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a part of her that was relieved Alistair hadn't looked at her. But another part, the foolish, broken part, felt crushed that he hadn't even spared her a glance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I ruined his life! Why can't he just scream at me? Demand answers? Curse me for what I did? Anything would hurt less than this silent indifference... anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard watched Alistair with a complicated expression. He looked too good... too put together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just a dog bought for two million. That's what you were. A slave for six years. So why the hell do you get to walk around with a perfect little family now? That's not fair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thin smile, Richard sneered. "Who's the kid? You really like raising other people's children, huh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alistair could respond, Eloise's voice rang out, loud and clear. "I'm not other people's kid! I'm Daddy's little bunny!"</span></p></div>
