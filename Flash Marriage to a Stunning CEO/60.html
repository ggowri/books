        <h1>Chapter 60 Someone Like Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alistair emerged from the study, the malice in his eyes had completely vanished, replaced by a casual, carefree demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise held up a colorful butterfly kite for Alistair to see. "Dad, look! I finished my kite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline glanced over, too. As their eyes met, Alistair gave her a slight smile, letting her know he was fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline exhaled with a sense of calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's beautiful," Alistair praised, seeing in it a reflection of his rebirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, Mom said she's taking me kite flying this weekend. Are you coming too?" Eloise looked at Alistair with hopeful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair hesitated for a moment before nodding. "Yes, I'll come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had originally planned to confront Liam tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Liam lived in the same city as him, they might as well have been in different worlds. They had almost no connection except for those occasional times when Alistair had to swallow his pride and use Rebecca's connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But how could Liam possibly compare to his little angel Eloise?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course spending time with his little angel was more important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam could dodge for now, but he couldn't hide forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair would settle that score eventually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And there was Rebecca too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He certainly couldn't forget about Rebecca, who had conspired with Liam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was the mastermind, and Liam was the accomplice. As his biological father, Liam siding with an outsider to sabotage his son made him a hundred times more despicable than Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would deal with each and every one of them. They would all be held accountable for what they'd done to his life!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>******</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca suddenly jolted awake from her dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her sleep schedule had been completely reversed these past couple of days&mdash;unable to fall asleep at night, then walking around in a daze during the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had fallen asleep before seven today, only to abruptly wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An inexplicable feeling of anxiety washed over her, making it impossible to fall back asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel was still at Cordelia and Nathaniel's place. Cordelia had softened after hearing about Rebecca's breakup with Richard and was now willing to chat with her like old times, but Nathaniel still wasn't warming up to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had tried acting sweet around Nathaniel a couple of times, but he had responded with such indifference that she felt too embarrassed to risk irritating him further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He probably thought she was just putting on an act and hadn't really ended things with Richard for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would just have to wait it out and let Nathaniel see her determination over time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard hadn't contacted her since their last falling out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was utterly disappointed in him and certainly wasn't going to demean herself anymore by abandoning her proud persona to chase after someone who clearly didn't value her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Anne called asking to meet, Rebecca realized she had been neglecting her friend for days. Anne was the only close friend she had left after her argument with Vivienne. Not wanting to become a lonely outcast, Rebecca covered her accumulated fatigue with thick foundation, grabbed her purse, and hurried to meet Anne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After just a few days apart, Anne was positively glowing. She immediately launched into excited chatter. "Rebecca, I've finally met my soulmate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The words "soulmate" stung Rebecca's ears, given her recent romantic failures. She was already regretting agreeing to this outing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne's mind was always filled with trivial pleasures and romance, or gossiping and spreading rumors about the families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, Rebecca had found it entertaining to pass time chatting about other people's business with Anne. But now, with her thoughts in turmoil and seeking genuine comfort, she realized her mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne wasn't someone who could help solve problems&mdash;she only made other people's troubles worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a long time, Rebecca believed that Richard was her true love. However, after overcoming all obstacles to be together, she realized that he was not the person she had believed she had fallen for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She no longer felt that flutter in her heart when she thought of Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't the typical transformation of passion into companionship that happened in long-term relationships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whenever Richard came to mind, all she could picture was his face as he called her stupid and criticized her parents for not taking her seriously. The memory made her uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could I have ever had feelings for someone like him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When this thought suddenly popped into her head, Rebecca froze. Anne was rambling on about how wonderful her new boyfriend was, but Rebecca couldn't focus on a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She silently sipped her drink, but when Anne declared, "He might be my soulmate for life," Rebecca couldn't help but caution her. "How long have you two known each other? Perhaps you should spend more time getting to know him before making hasty assumptions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like with her and Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was deeply infatuated with Richard at that time. She thought he was the perfect prince, the most special person in the world. In her eyes, no other man could possibly compare to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only after they got together did she discover he was just an ordinary man after all. He had bodily functions, could be insincere, and when it came to matters affecting his interests, he could be just as petty and stubborn as anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the rose-colored glasses of first love shattered, she realized he was nothing special&mdash;just another man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne protested loudly, clearly defensive about her relationship. "What do you mean? You're free to show off your romantic side with Rick, but I'm not allowed to do the same with my boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca suddenly felt the conversation had become pointless. There was no use talking when they were on entirely different wavelengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a tone that was three parts placating and seven parts dismissive, she said, "Fine, fine, I was wrong. I wish you and your boyfriend eternal happiness and many children! I need to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Anne could respond, Rebecca stood up and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The neon lights flickered along the street, presenting a scene of urban prosperity everywhere she looked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This kind of artificial opulence, built on piles of money, felt as bland to Rebecca now as leftover food reheated for the second time&mdash;completely tasteless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne, who never knew when to stop talking, called out as she followed Rebecca outside. "Rebecca, why are you leaving so early? Richard isn't being controlling, is he? Keeping you all to himself so you can't hang out with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca didn't want to hear that name anymore. She was about to tell Anne bluntly that she and Richard were ancient history when her peripheral vision caught a tall, slender figure. Her heart suddenly skipped a beat, and she turned her head to look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne continued chattering, "Hey, I was telling you about my boyfriend&mdash;wait, doesn't that person look just like Alistair?"</span></p></div>
