        <h1>Chapter 82 No Comparison</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long ago, in order to make Daniel quickly accept Richard, she had been telling Daniel all the time that Alistair was just a servant in their family and didn't deserve to be his dad at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no matter how she taught him, Daniel had called Alistair Dad for several years. When mentioning Alistair, he would use "old dad" instead, and of course, Richard was the "new dad".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca said, "I'm talking about your old dad... Alistair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she said Alistair's name, Rebecca's heart twitched uncontrollably. It seemed that his name was a pain that she couldn't touch in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel thought carefully and shook his head. "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca wasn't willing to give up and tried hard to find evidence that Alistair had an attachment to her and Daniel. "What about at other times? Think carefully. Didn't he do it even once? Your dad used to treat you so well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel opened his mouth blankly and thought for a long time, then said, "Mom, I don't remember..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was extremely disappointed. She tried hard to recall it in her mind. In her opinion, although Alistair took very good care of her and Daniel in every detail, he was like a robot without warmth, just working methodically according to the instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, why did my dad become another kid's dad?" Daniel asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca looked dejected. She didn't know how to explain the complicated world of adults to him, let alone her relationship with Alistair, which even adults couldn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, I don't want a new dad anymore. The new dad is too mean! I want my old dad. I don't want him to be another kid's dad! Mom, ask my old dad to come back. I want my old dad!" Daniel shook Rebecca's arm and pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A pang of pain shot through Rebecca's heart. She also wanted Alistair to come back. She had been dreaming of returning to their previous life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her parents had already accepted him. If Alistair came back, Rebecca would also be willing to rein in her temper and live a good life with him. However, there were no "what ifs" in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, whenever Rebecca saw Alistair, she would feel an inner dread. She would secretly hide behind and, like a creep, gaze at him longingly, quietly memorizing his face and his smile in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't know when it happened, but the relationship between her and Alistair had subtly changed. Once haughty and high-and-mighty, she now didn't even have the courage to approach Alistair and start a conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was extremely anxious. She could feel that the distance between her and Alistair was getting wider and wider, which made her feel really panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Whitfield." Eva, who had come with a task, finally found Rebecca and Daniel behind a tree and trotted over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was startled. When she saw it was Eva, she frowned and rebuked Eva in a tone as if scolding a child, "Eva, you're already an adult. Why are you shouting like that? You scared me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for this morning, when Rebecca couldn't hold back and gave Daniel a good spanking, she was usually very gentle and motherly to Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva was at a loss for words. She really wanted to throw the first-aid kit on the ground, point at Rebecca's nose, and say bravely, "I quit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if she didn't notice Eva's stiff face, Rebecca asked, "What did you talk about with Alistair just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The unhappiness in Eva's heart was soon replaced by an indescribable sense of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva felt a bit gleeful.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">You try being bratty and overbearing again! Alistair doesn't want you anymore. You really deserve it. You want to know what Alistair said to me? I won't tell you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We didn't say much. We just greeted each other casually," Eva said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca seemed to think of something, and her expression softened. "Eva, did you ask Alistair for his contact information?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eva waved her hand nonchalantly. "No. He said he was busy with something, and I didn't have the nerve to ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's pretty face visibly dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pretending not to notice the dejected Rebecca, Eva went on, "Besides, Alistair has a family now. He must be busy taking care of his own family and probably doesn't want to talk to me. Even if I got his number, he still wouldn't pay me any heed. It's as if I don't have it at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's face grew more and more displeased as she thought about the fact that Alistair had blocked her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair returned home and found that Caroline had taken sick leave and hadn't gone to the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you taken your medicine?" After getting a negative answer, Alistair turned around and poured a glass of water, then handed it to Caroline. "Taking the medicine on time will make you recover faster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he felt that he was being naggy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the glass of water in front of her, Caroline didn't take it and just looked at him with her beautiful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was a bit stunned. He had fed her the medicine at night, but that was something he had to do because there was no other way. Now that Caroline was awake, he didn't think she needed him to feed her the medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While he was uneasily speculating about Caroline's thoughts, Caroline finally took the glass of water and stretched out her hand with her palm facing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair poured the pills he had taken out earlier into her palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When his hand was three centimeters away from her palm, he directly dropped a few pills into Caroline's palm, avoiding physical contact with her and maintaining an appropriate social distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was unhappy.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">You jerk. You clearly have feelings for me. Why are you pretending to resist me? Since you like me, be bold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she was relieved. After all, she wasn't the kind of coy girl, and she didn't mind who chased whom. She was sure that he couldn't escape in this life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>First, she tilted her head back and took the medicine, then asked a question seriously, "What do you think of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment of silence, Alistair felt that she had asked this question before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, generally speaking, when someone asked such a question, it was very likely that they had a crush on the other person and were blatantly asking about the other person's feelings. But when Caroline asked it, her expression was as serious as a teacher asking a question, making it difficult for Alistair to take it romantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair answered honestly, "You're very nice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline tried to hold back the corners of her mouth and asked, "How do I compare to Rebecca?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The corners of Alistair's mouth twitched. In his heart, comparing Caroline with Rebecca was like belittling Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair said honestly, "There's no comparison between you two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline narrowed her eyes. Although she knew that Alistair meant that Rebecca was not as good as her and she was very satisfied with Alistair's answer, she just wanted to tease him now.</span></p></div>
