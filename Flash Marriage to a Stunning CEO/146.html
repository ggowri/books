        <h1>Chapter 146 Her Actual Husband</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo finished his interrogation of Alistair and then turned to Caroline, his voice deadly serious. "Carol, you know your father. He's tough. This guy might not pass muster."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ugh, it sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair couldn't bring himself to care all that much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, ever since he found out Caroline and her old man weren't exactly on speaking terms, getting the seal of approval from the richest man had dropped way down on his list of priorities.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's expression hardened. "He's my man. I don't need anyone's damn approval."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo frowned, a crease forming between his brows, "Caroline, can you just stop being so damn stubborn for once in your life?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both like older brothers to her, in a way. But Julian was never annoying like this. He always saw things from Caroline's perspective, always had her back, always supportive.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo, on the other hand... Maybe it was the blood tie that made him feel so entitled, or maybe his high-and-mighty social status had just turned him into a bossy jerk, but every time he opened his mouth, it was like a condescending, "I know best" lecture.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Doesn't he get it? Caroline isn't some naive little girl he could just push around!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wasn't about to stand by and let anyone talk down to his wife. "My wife makes her own choices for her own life. She doesn't need anyone else telling her what to do or how to live it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, that really set Leo off. He jabbed a finger at Alistair, his face a mask of pure arrogance and contempt. "And who the hell do you think you are, calling me an outsider?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words were barely out of his mouth before Caroline's hand flashed out and smacked him clean across the face. It happened so fast that Alistair didn't even see it coming.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Okay, so Alistair missed the action. Not like the slap landed on his face, after all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Leo, incredibly, didn't see it coming either. He just stood there, stunned, after taking the hit full-on, completely poleaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why wouldn't he be? He was a chart-topping, critically acclaimed singer-songwriter, used to people fawning over him wherever he went. Forget getting slapped. Most people barely dared to raise their voices in his presence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline, her face like ice, mimicked Leo's earlier gesture, pointing right at his nose. "You will speak to my husband with respect! And if there's a next time, I swear, you'll be eating your meals through a straw!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone left no room for doubt. She wasn't bluffing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even her own relatives weren't safe if they dared to disrespect Alistair. She'd go full scorched-earth on anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was floored, incredibly touched by how fiercely and unequivocally Caroline defended him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A wife like this? Seriously, what more could a guy possibly ask for?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait a minute, though. When I'd first charged in, I'd put myself between her and that guy. When the hell does she start playing bodyguard for me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually hit me for him? I'm your actual cousin, for God's sake!" Leo looked like his whole world was crumbling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's voice was cold, ruthless. "And he's my actual husband! Now, why don't you make yourself scarce and get the hell away from me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo clutched his chest dramatically, glaring daggers at Alistair. "What did you do to her? Did you put some kind of spell on her or something?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair just sighed, a wave of weariness washing over him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vaguely remembered, way back when he and Caroline first got together, Julian actually asking him if he knew some kind of black magic...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the usually unflappable, seen-it-all Mabel hadn't been able to completely mask the searching, speculative look in her eyes when she first met him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All their reactions pointed to one undeniable truth. Before Alistair, Caroline had never, ever been close to another man.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides him, the only people in her tight-knit inner circle were Eloise, Mabel, and Julian. Her social life was so incredibly sparse that it was almost heartbreaking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was clear now that it was her choice. She didn't like a crowded, complicated life and had actively, deliberately kept most people at arm's length.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair felt an overwhelming sense of honor and privilege to have been allowed into her exclusive world, and not just allowed in, but to have been made such an incredibly important part of it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Alistair honestly truly had no earthly idea why Caroline liked him, he knew, deep down in his bones, that it wasn't because of the System.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The System had been crystal clear at that point. It had only provided the opportunity for them to meet. Everything that had happened after that, their entire relationship, had all unfolded naturally, organically, all of them. The System had nothing to do with it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that knowledge filled Alistair with an immense, profound sense of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His current, almost ridiculously smooth-sailing life had a lot to do with the System's behind-the-scenes help, but if Caroline's feelings for him had also been some kind of System-generated perk? That would have seriously, fundamentally grossed him out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Feelings and emotions are the most sacred, special things in this world. If even those can be manipulated and messed with, then what's left to believe in, to hold onto?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leo, what in God's name happened to your face? The concert's about to start! You can't go out there and face your fans looking like that! Who did this to you? Was it them?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's assistant came rushing over, noticed Leo's bruised and swollen face, and let out a shriek that could curdle milk, immediately pointing an accusing finger at Alistair and Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two have some serious nerve! Do you have any idea who this is? If this concert gets cancelled because of you, can you even begin to fathom the kind of damages you'll be on the hook for? I'm calling the cops! Right now! I'm having you both arrested!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo rubbed his temples, a vein throbbing with irritation. "Call the cops? Are you kidding me? You think I'm not embarrassed enough as it is? You want to plaster my messed-up face all over the goddamn tabloids?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant was practically wringing his hands. "But Leo, your face..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo snapped, his patience clearly gone. "What about my face? It's not like I make a living off my pretty boy looks, you know, hey! Don't you two walk away from me! I'm not finished talking yet!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant, suddenly emboldened by Leo's presence, tried to block Alistair and Caroline, who were already heading for the exit, completely ignoring him. "You think you can just assault someone and then waltz off? You two are in some serious, deep trouble! You can expect a nasty letter from our lawyer, real soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lunged forward a little too aggressively, looking like he was about to barrel right into Caroline. Alistair's brow furrowed, and with a movement so quick and smooth it was almost a blur, he took the assistant down, too!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assistant was, yet again, rendered completely speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo, still gingerly rubbing his own bruised face, was also momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn, this kid actually gets some serious moves!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline looked up at Alistair, her eyes shining with pure adoration. "Honey, you're so amazing!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair puffed out his chest a little, a smug grin playing on his lips. "Well, naturally!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo nearly choked on his own spit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Me and my assistant... Are we seriously just becoming unwilling props in this couple's sickeningly sweet love-fest?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No, we aren't even worthy of being called props because these two psychos haven't treated us like actual threats from the goddamn get-go! Ugh! This is humiliating!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's gaze followed the sleek, expensive car as it sped away, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who the hell is this guy, anyway? How has he managed to turn the ice-cold, unapproachable Caroline into this soft, gentle, almost simpering woman?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo, his expression utterly dazed, actually raised his hand and gave himself a light slap across the cheek.</span><br><span>Ow! Okay, it hurts. So, it's definitely not a dream!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His assistant, groaning and moaning, finally managed to pick himself up off the ground and limped over to Leo, "Leo, are we just gonna let this slide? Just like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo shot him a withering glare. "What else do you suggest we do, genius? Didn't you just see me get my ass handed to me on a silver platter? And you still charged in like a brainless idiot!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Come to think of it, every single time I'd ever been well and truly humiliated in my entire life, Caroline has somehow been involved!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn it, it had just been too long since we'd actually seen each other. My judgment has been way off. I'd actually thought that getting out into the real world and becoming independent and successful would have mellowed her out and smoothed some of her rougher edges. Who knows...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Actually, Caroline's temper has gotten better. Significantly better. But apparently, that improvement is reserved exclusively for that guy...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who the hell is that guy?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He just waltzes in, completely out of nowhere, and somehow manages to snatch away my one-in-a-million, totally unique Caroline! I am not having it! This is not okay!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was still fuming, lost in his own indignant thoughts, completely oblivious to the fact that his assistant was furtively tapping away on his phone, sending a detailed, play-by-play account of everything that had just happened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, the assistant's phone buzzed with a reply: [Tell that Freya chick about all this. And drop a hint that if she ever wants a snowball's chance in hell of being his wife, she needs to prove she knows how to help her man get his dignity back when he's been wronged.]</span></p></div>
