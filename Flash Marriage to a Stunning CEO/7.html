        <h1>Chapter 7 Fatherhood</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a beat, Richard asked, "Did you pick up Danny?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's mind went blank, a buzz ringing in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Weren't you supposed to get him?" she said, her voice rising. "Didn't you say you wanted to bond with him, build that father-son thing? You... You didn't go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's tone turned sheepish. "I'm so sorry, Rebecca. I got swamped today and completely forgot. Where's Danny now? He's not still at the kindergarten, is he? Look, you go grab him, and I'll make it up to him when I get home, I swear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She'd wanted to prove Vivienne wrong, but instead, she'd proven herself mistaken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Rebecca rushed toward the kindergarten, Vivienne watched her go, shaking her head with a sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca used to glide through life with effortless poise. Even after having Daniel, she lived like a carefree girl, untouched by mundane worries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair had been gone less than a day, and her world was already unraveling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Vivienne silently hoped Rebecca wouldn't come to regret her choices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While Rebecca raced to retrieve her son, Alistair was comfortably lounging on a sofa by the floor-to-ceiling window, playing with the latest, most expensive smartphones on the market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca had always kept him on a tight leash, claiming gadgets would distract him. She'd given him a clunky old phone that could barely handle calls and texts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an era of digital payments, she insisted on handing him cash, meticulously tracking every penny. He had to log every expense, and she'd pore over his records. Over the years, Alistair had filled dozens of notebooks just keeping accounts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd been cut off from the world for too long, and he needed to catch up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, suddenly, Alistair abruptly stumbled into a life of luxury, coasting on someone else's dime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sleek phone in his hand was a gift from Caroline. The presidential suite he was relaxing in was also booked by Caroline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Rebecca finally reached Daniel, whose voice was hoarse from crying, Alistair was casually skimming news headlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca scooped up her son, soothing him as they headed home. When Richard apologized profusely, she brushed it off with understanding. "Don't beat yourself up. It's normal. You're still adjusting to fatherhood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Exhausted from a day of shopping, all she wanted was a good meal and a long soak in a bubble bath to melt away her fatigue. But when she glanced at the dining table, it was bare. The kitchen showed no signs of use.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This never would've happened before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard, ever attentive, massaged her shoulders and guided her to the table. "Dinner's coming right up. Just hang tight for a bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's hopes lifted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard had always bragged about his cooking. He said he'd picked it up during his six years abroad to take care of himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She believed his breakfast flop was just overeagerness. She figured that was just nerves. Maybe he was saving his real skills for tonight. Curious about what he'd whip up for dinner, she wondered if he'd staged the untouched kitchen for a surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The doorbell rang. Richard darted to answer it, and soon, the table was laden with an array of dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sat across from her, his smile warm. "Dig in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca stared at the spread, disbelief creeping in. "This is dinner?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She couldn't believe it. Richard had ordered takeout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if it was from a five-star restaurant, it was still takeout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A wave of disappointment washed over her, snuffing out her appetite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel, unusually cooperative, dug in without complaint. His earlier meltdown had left him ravenous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard thoughtfully passed the shrimp to Rebecca and Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel took one bite and spat it out. "Gross! It's nowhere near as good as Dad's."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His words plunged the room into an awkward silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Oblivious to the tension, the five-year-old kept complaining, "This is awful. I want Dad's shrimp. Mom, I want Dad's shrimp!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca shot a quick glance at Richard, relieved to see he seemed unfazed. Turning to Daniel, she snapped, "What did I tell you? Mr. Morgan is your dad. Your real dad. Got it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel, spoiled and used to getting his way, had never been scolded like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn't think he'd said anything wrong. Staring at his mother's fierce expression, he let out a wail and burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard tried to calm him, gently chiding Rebecca. "Come on, he's just a kid. No need to get worked up. He's young. Give it time, and he'll know who his real family is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca instantly regretted her outburst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Years ago, she and Richard had dated in secret, and she'd gotten pregnant with Daniel. He'd begged her to terminate it, saying it would ruin their future. But she had refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When they broke up and he left for school abroad, Rebecca faced immense pressure but stubbornly brought Daniel into the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel wasn't just her flesh and blood. He was the unbreakable bond between her and Richard. She cherished him fiercely and, until today, had never raised her voice at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pulled out every trick in the book to coax him back into a good mood. Only after he finally calmed down did she allow herself to slip away for her long-awaited bath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She undressed, stood in front of the tub, and froze. It was empty. For six years, Alistair had always drawn her bath in advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By the time she finally sank into the warm water, ready to savor a moment of peace, Daniel's cries echoed through the bathroom door.</p></div>
