        <h1>Chapter 104 Unattainable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair explained the concept of security to Eloise, who listened thoughtfully before declaring with utmost seriousness, "Daddy, you don't just give Mommy a sense of security&mdash;you give it to me too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I used to cling to Mommy, scared to sleep alone. But since you came, I've been sleeping like a baby, not a single fear in sight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair smiled warmly, "That's my honor, sweetheart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Caroline swapped her professional attire for a youthful, loose-fitting outfit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had a penchant for comfort in her downtime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair, having already changed into casual wear before picking up Eloise, was ready to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The trio headed out together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm thinking of signing up for driving lessons tomorrow," Alistair mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this day and age, it was rare to find a young adult who didn't drive, but Alistair was one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline nodded. "Sure, even though we have a driver, it's good to learn. Skills never hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The phrase "we have" warmed Alistair's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had a way of subtly reminding him he was part of the family, and it always touched him deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Vivienne had grown into her role as the owner of the pizza shop, where the initial chaos had transitioned to smooth operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the initial rush from the grand opening promotions, business had stabilized. Thanks to its stellar reputation, high-quality service, and unique approach, the shop had secured a loyal customer base and was thriving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne had fully embraced her entrepreneurial spirit, practically living at the shop, so much so that she considered setting up a bed there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her focus was briefly interrupted by a well-meaning elder from her hometown who had taken it upon themselves to nag her about finding a boyfriend. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While her parents were understanding and didn't pressure her, it was tough to brush off the elder, as she was just showing her love, fearing that if Vivienne didn't act fast, all the good guys would be snapped up. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a forced smile, Vivienne had to bite her tongue and endure the nagging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure, Vivienne was ambitious and driven, but who could resist the allure of a sweet romance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But dating wasn't as simple as grabbing a random guy off the street. She had to be attracted to him at least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne wasn't that desperate; she was smart and believed in waiting for the right one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, so far, she hadn't met many guys who made her heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Come to think of it...</span><br><span>Vivienne's eyes landed on the fruit buffet area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, a tall hunk was helping himself to some watermelon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't see his face, but just his back was a sight for sore eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne wasn't one to judge solely by looks&mdash;she prided herself on being more than just superficial&mdash;but she couldn't deny the appeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone loved a beautiful view, and it was only natural to take a second look at a good-looking person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And on the second glance, a sense of familiarity washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he turned around, their eyes met, and he greeted her with a smile. "Long time no see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since this was Vivienne's joint, it was no surprise Alistair wasn't fazed to see her. In her own restaurant, diners often bumped into the owner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne returned the smile. "Indeed. You look great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was obvious to anyone that Alistair was doing well. His stylish attire and vibrant energy were a dead giveaway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exuded an air of detachment yet kindness, a clear sign he was happy with his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne couldn't help but sigh.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Since he left Rebecca, he's really blossomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's like he's shed that old, listless self and finally become the person he was always meant to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne didn't mention the last time she'd seen Alistair at the shop, mainly because the unpleasant scene with Rebecca had overshadowed the encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Rebecca left, Vivienne had been too busy to notice when Alistair slipped away or that Rebecca had been lying in wait for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two exchanged polite small talk, about to go their separate ways, when a voice chimed in from behind, "No wonder you've been dodging those blind dates&mdash;you've already found someone yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An elderly woman with silver hair beamed at Alistair, her smile widening as she took him in. "My, my, what a fine young man! You and Vivienne make such a handsome pair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne, flustered, tried to explain, "It's not like that. He's not&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman interrupted with a knowing wave, "I know, I know. You're just shy about introducing your boyfriend to the family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne fell silent for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd once harbored a fleeting crush on Alistair, but that was as far as it went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elderly woman was her great-aunt, visiting from their hometown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to her frail health, the family had arranged for her to stay with them while she consulted a renowned doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman clasped Alistair's hand warmly. "My dear, Vivienne is a wonderful girl. You must promise never to hurt her&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad!" A bright voice cut through the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise tugged at Alistair's sleeve. "Dad, what's taking so long? Mom and I have been waiting forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair, with a hint of pride, introduced her to Vivienne. "This is my daughter, Eloise Ashbourne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he gestured toward the elegant woman by the window. "And that's my wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline, sensing the attention, turned their way and smiled. In that instant, the entire pizzeria seemed to fade into the background, her presence eclipsing everything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She carried an aura that made the world around her dim in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Caroline approached, Alistair couldn't hide the pride in his voice. "Let me introduce you to my wife, Caroline Ashbourne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Vivienne's first time meeting Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During their previous visit, the angle had obscured her view of the woman sitting across from Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first glance, Vivienne couldn't help but compare Caroline to Rebecca, but she quickly realized it was a futile exercise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was simply no comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she and Rebecca had been friends for over two decades, Vivienne had to admit, objectively, that Rebecca paled in comparison to Caroline in every way&mdash;looks, grace, everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It seems my former best friend is destined to pine after someone unattainable again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">First, it was Richard, and now it's Alistair.</span></p></div>
