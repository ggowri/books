        <h1>Chapter 56 Taking Advantage</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he knew it, he had drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Caroline entered the apartment, she glanced toward the bedroom. The door was shut tight, leading her to assume Alistair had already gone to bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She peeked in on the sleeping Eloise, planted a goodnight kiss, and quietly slipped out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Caroline had converted Alistair's old room into a library, it still had a bathroom attached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had planned to use his former room's bathroom to avoid disturbing him but suddenly remembered she hadn't brought her clothes. She would need to go back after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She placed her hand on the doorknob and turned it gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The carpeted floor and her deliberately light footsteps ensured she didn't make a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room was exceptionally quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was so quiet that she could only hear her own deliberately slowed breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline grabbed her clean pajamas, about to turn and leave when a curious thought struck her. Was Alistair really as peaceful a sleeper as he claimed to be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She decided it was better not to seek the truth. She didn't want to startle him. Besides, she'd have plenty of chances to find out later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After her shower, Caroline navigated through the unlit living room, instinctively finding her way to the sofa and slowly sitting down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her hand reached habitually for a throw pillow, but instead of the soft cushion she expected, her fingers brushed against something unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The object had a firm feel to the touch. Caroline wondered if it might be one of Eloise's toys or something belonging to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Eloise wasn't one to leave her things scattered around, and from what she'd observed, Alistair was too neat and organized for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uncertain about the object she was touching, she decided to investigate further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the darkness, Caroline expanded her exploration, feeling around more extensively.</span><br><span>Hmm, it was warm too...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she finally realized what&mdash;or rather who&mdash;she had been fondling, she froze completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood rushed straight to her head, feeling as if she'd burst into flames from sheer embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's first instinct in her intense embarrassment was to quickly leave the scene. She could pretend to be innocent about the entire situation...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, someone caught her wandering hand in their grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a hand with a warm palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had held this hand before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd been secretly waiting for another chance to hold it, but before that opportunity naturally arose, she'd gone ahead and taken it&mdash;or rather, her hand had been captured instead. She should have been secretly delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The premise was that she hadn't been taking advantage of the situation by shamelessly caressing the sleeping beauty on the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The normally unflappable Caroline was now in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What she should have done was pull her hand away and explain to Alistair, whom she had accidentally awakened with her touch, that it wasn't intentional. She could also scold him for sleeping on the couch when he had a perfectly good bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After grabbing her hand, Alistair didn't immediately let go. He rolled onto his side facing her, nuzzled his head against her waist, and then became completely still...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline remained motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through the thin fabric of her nightgown, she could clearly feel the warmth of Alistair's breath on her skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline barely dared to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was afraid of waking him from his slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time passed; Alistair slept deeply and peacefully, showing no signs of waking up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had been sitting rigidly on the sofa for who knows how long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the complete silence, feeling Alistair's warmth and listening to his steady breathing had somehow become an indescribable pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gradually began to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without realizing it, Alistair's grip on her hand loosened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could have pulled her hand from his palm long ago, but she hadn't done so, even though her limbs were beginning to go numb from sitting still for so long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If only the night could last a little longer...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the day, Alistair always deliberately kept his distance from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From Alistair's perspective, the distance he maintained was perfectly appropriate, but from Caroline's view, he treated himself too much like an outsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time stretched on until Caroline's eyelids grew heavy and her mind became foggy. Just then, the sleeping man suddenly moved his leg, instantly dispelling her drowsiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair rubbed his face, taking a couple of seconds to regain his senses. His voice was hoarse from sleep as he mumbled, "Ms. Ashbourne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That formal address immediately irritated Caroline. "Yes, it's me," she replied coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did he treat himself as an outsider, but he also consistently distanced himself from her. How annoying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was an impersonal way to address her. Did he think she was his boss?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline rolled her eyes inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's tone was cold, carrying a hint of accusation. "Why are you sleeping on the couch? If Eloise sees you like this, she'll start crying again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair apologized, "I'm sorry. I wanted to wait for you to come home from work, but I accidentally fell asleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be honest, the couch was quite comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he could, he'd be perfectly content sleeping on the couch indefinitely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So he'd been waiting for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's heart softened immediately, and her tone grew considerably gentler. "Get up and go to bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair responded softly, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he was awake, his mind was still foggy&mdash;he was in that state where he would obediently do whatever someone asked of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Caroline had no complaints whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would accept his formal address for now; she'd give him some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair walked into the bedroom, flopped down on the bed, and quickly fell back asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was exhausted too. With an inexplicable feeling of satisfaction and security, she drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On their second night sharing a bed, Alistair woke up on time feeling refreshed and energetic. Caroline, on the other hand, was uncharacteristically sleeping in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't her fault&mdash;she had gone to bed so late last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had checked the time before falling asleep; it was already two-thirty in the morning. Given that she had only slept for four or five hours, it would be unusual for her to be awake now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair got out of bed carefully, trying not to make a sound. Caroline was wrapped in a thin silk comforter, lying on her side facing his direction. Her long eyelashes cast soft shadows as they rested against her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair tried to piece together what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He remembered waiting for her in the living room, then accidentally falling asleep on the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He vaguely recalled Caroline waking him up from the sofa, but everything after that was a blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's long hair was spread messily across the white pillow, her sleeping face peaceful&mdash;a Sleeping Beauty pleasing to the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of waking up to such a beautiful sight every morning actually seemed quite nice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment this idea popped into his head, Alistair was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What on earth was he thinking?!</span></p></div>
