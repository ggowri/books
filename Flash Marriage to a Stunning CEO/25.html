        <h1>Chapter 25 Daniel Is Not My Son</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair had thought that once he stepped out of Whitfield Manor, he could cleanly sever ties with Rebecca and the Whitfield family once and for all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet reality took an unexpected turn&mdash;one that pushed him past his limits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After careful consideration and a discussion with Caroline, he decided to take the initiative and approach Nathaniel directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn't want to deal with Rebecca because he believed she was irrational. Reasoning with her was futile, so going straight to her parents seemed like the better option.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He avoided Whitfield Manor, knowing Cordelia often spent her days shopping or playing cards with other wealthy socialites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So he headed straight for Nathaniel's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel, who had been waiting to confront Alistair, assumed he had come to apologize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Alistair requested a meeting, Nathaniel deliberately made him wait for over an hour before finally receiving him with a stern expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sitting behind his desk, Nathaniel adopted the demeanor of a displeased elder, his gaze heavy with disapproval as if daring Alistair to try and talk his way out of this. But Alistair's first words hit like a thunderbolt. "Rebecca and I are divorced."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel, seasoned and unshakable, recovered quickly. "Because of that woman yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was baffled. "What?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't play dumb," Nathaniel growled, his voice laced with authority. "I saw you at the restaurant yesterday. Don't tell me I mistook you for someone else. The place has surveillance&mdash;I can pull the footage anytime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did Alistair realize his encounter with Rebecca hadn't been a coincidence.<br>But why don't they know about the divorce?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Well, that's not the point. The point is, since we're already divorced&mdash;and since Rebecca couldn't wait to kick me out&mdash;who I spend time with is none of their business. I really don't understand what Rebecca is trying to pull here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was convinced Rebecca needed professional help&mdash;her delusions were getting worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Refusing to take the blame, he stated plainly. "Rebecca was the one who filed for divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel scoffed, "Then it must still be your fault. If everything was fine, why would she want a divorce? And who was that woman you were with? Did you leave my daughter for her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His tone dripped with certainty as if he had already pieced together the entire story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair remained unruffled by the accusation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, Nathaniel would trust his own daughter&mdash;that was only natural.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And Rebecca had once been so determined to marry him that she'd threatened to cut ties with her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then Alistair dropped the real bombshell, his voice eerily calm. "Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield, Danny is not my son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel's face went blank. "What did you just say? That's bullshit." It took him several seconds to process the words. Then, shock and fury set in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair had anticipated this reaction. Calmly, he replied, "If you don't believe me, I'm willing to take a paternity test."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was then that Nathaniel noticed the change in Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The once meek and compliant man now met his gaze steadily, his eyes brimming with an unfamiliar confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The cold, detached way Alistair addressed him made Nathaniel feel like he was looking at a stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Stunned, Nathaniel's anger flared. "Don't you dare slander my daughter's reputation!" If you keep spouting nonsense, I'll make sure you regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm not lying," Alistair said evenly. "Danny's father is a man named Richard Morgan. He and Rebecca were classmates."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He laid out every detail methodically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel wavered between disbelief and dread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't&mdash;wouldn't&mdash;accept that Rebecca could have done something so outrageous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could she have secretly dated some boy, clung to him even after he abandoned her, and then dragged an innocent like Alistair into this mess just to force that man's hand?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Nathaniel, a man who had weathered countless storms, found his worldview shaken. "No. That's impossible. Absolutely impossible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair pressed on. "Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield, Danny's biological father has already returned. I'm sure he'll come knocking on your door soon. As for Rebecca and me&mdash;it was nothing more than a two-million-dollar transaction. Now that it's over, it's time to move on. So please tell Rebecca to stop bothering me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel's head spun. He braced himself against the desk, sinking into his chair with a bitter laugh. "What did you say the father's name was?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair enunciated each syllable. "Richard Morgan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A dreadful suspicion crept into Nathaniel's mind. "Say it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Richard Morgan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By the time Rebecca arrived, Nathaniel had regained his composure&mdash;outwardly, at least.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Rebecca, when were you planning to introduce Richard to your mother and me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca froze mid-step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Any hope Nathaniel had clung to shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> it's true. Every word Alistair said was true.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel studied Rebecca's panic-stricken face and let out a humorless chuckle. "Well, no matter what, he is Danny's father. Now that he's back from abroad, the least he could do is pay us a visit. Where are his manners?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's voice trembled. "Dad... how did you know&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I haven't even told you yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The office windows were shut, but the heavy drapes on the right side of the floor-to-ceiling window rustled. Then, a tall figure stepped out from behind them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair addressed Nathaniel. "Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield, seeing is believing. Now you know I wasn't lying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel pressed his lips into a thin line, refusing to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair turned his gaze to Rebecca, his tone indifferent. "Ms. Whitfield, you've gotten what you wanted. Now go enjoy your life with Mr. Morgan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, he walked out without a backward glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's legs gave way, and she nearly collapsed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She spun around instinctively, about to chase after him. "Alistair!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Stop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel's roar sent a violent shudder through her. She stared at him in terror, her father's face dark with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Richard? Is he the Richard I know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's hands and feet turned to ice, her body shaking uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For a moment, it was as if she had been thrown back six years, to the day she'd brought Alistair before her parents to "confess."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Back then, my doting father was just as furious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm his precious jewel. If someone hurt me, he'd want them dead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But this time, it's different. This time, it's because I disobeyed him and entangled myself with the disgraced illegitimate son of the Morgan family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Six years ago, Alistair stood by my side. Today, I'm facing this storm alone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A sharp slap landed across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Disgraceful! Utterly disgraceful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nathaniel's veins bulged at his temples as he jabbed a finger at her. "How could you be this stupid!"</p></div>
