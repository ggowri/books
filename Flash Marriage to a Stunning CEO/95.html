        <h1>Chapter 95 Useful Pawn</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair put the pillow back in its proper place. After a moment's deliberation, he inched his own pillow closer to Caroline's until they were practically touching. Lost in a reverie, he could picture himself lying beside her in bed, their noses almost brushing as they stared into each other's eyes with adoration. Damn it! He felt the corners of his mouth curving up into a smile again, and he couldn't seem to rein it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two minutes later, Alistair emerged from the bedroom with a poker face. He grabbed his keys and made for the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I can't just soak in the bliss of finally having a home. It's been two days already. I need to keep my cool. Business always comes first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the garage, apart from the car used for picking up and dropping off Eloise, there were seven or eight sleek luxury cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had told him that he could pick any car he liked and have the driver take him wherever he needed to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nevertheless, Alistair decided against taking a luxury car. Instead, he got into an unassuming ride-hailing car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Showing up in a flashy car would be way too showy and might throw a wrench in his plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to his initial schedule, Alistair was supposed to head back to his hometown today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd planned to set off in the morning and be back before it was time to pick up Eloise. There was no way he'd miss that, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two hours later, Alistair found himself standing in front of his old family home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mulberry tree that once yielded white mulberries was nowhere to be seen, replaced by a charming garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A pang of sadness hit him, but he had to admit that the yard looked far nicer than he'd recalled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was his first return since the house was sold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elderly couple who'd purchased the house used to live in the city center. After retiring, they'd decided to relocate to this suburban cottage to enjoy their retirement. They were incredibly kind. Before Alistair's last departure, they'd even told him that if he ever yearned for home, he was welcome to come back and stay for a few days as there were spare rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's arrival delighted the old folks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On his way over, he'd stopped to pick up some fruits and gifts. It just wouldn't have been proper to show up empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old couple chided him for spending money, but then promptly washed the fruits and fetched some snacks to treat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair settled comfortably in the yard, engaging in a lively chat with the elderly couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the conversation flowed, he subtly shifted the topic to the house in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man gave him a straightforward answer. "When we first moved in, there were still folks living in that house. You could see the lights on both the upper and lower floors at night. But after some time, it was always pitch-black. We've got no idea when they moved out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This response caught Alistair off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Right after I left, the people in the front house moved out too. What a strange coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Am I just overthinking things? Maybe Caroline has nothing to do with that house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But the way she reacted that day... It's hard not to be suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair politely turned down the old couple's warm invitation to stay and got to his feet to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ride-hailing car was waiting for him by the roadside. He handed the driver two thousand dollars and told him to hang around so he could leave at his convenience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After convincing the old couple to head back inside, Alistair found himself standing in front of the dilapidated two-story house. A sudden impulse welled up within him.</span><br><span>I really gotta go in and take a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His curiosity about the place where that child had been kept was simply irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the house was put up for sale, Alistair had been inside it. However, since the family inside was small and they mainly occupied the first floor, rarely venturing to the second, he'd never set foot upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even though the house was currently empty, a rusty padlock hung on the bolt, barring any entry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And even if there hadn't been a lock, it wouldn't have been appropriate for him to simply barge in uninvited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Alistair's eyes sharpened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hey, where's that rusty padlock that was on the bolt last time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To his surprise, there was no lock on the rusty iron gate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tilted his head up to look at the second-floor windows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logically, even if it were the same people from back then inside, it shouldn't matter to him. But he couldn't explain this nagging curiosity that made him desperate to know who was in there right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, a hand landed on Alistair's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair assumed it was a neighbor from his hometown who'd recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Well, he wasn't being conceited. Back in the day, he'd had a stellar reputation around here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the neighbors had adored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, after he'd moved to New York, with Celeste's continuous meddling, the good impression he'd left on the neighbors had probably faded into the annals of the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair spun around and came face to face with a pair of smiling eyes that lacked any real warmth. For a split second, he was caught off guard.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What's he doing here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man, a few years his senior, probably in his late twenties, was tall and skinny. He sported casual clothes and a small ponytail, exuding an air of sophistication with a touch of artistic allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, there was something off-putting about the way he grinned at Alistair. "Hey, I need a word with you. Let's go over there and talk, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair kept his cool, his eyes discreetly surveying the area. He noticed several figures quickly ducking into the corners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tsk." Alistair clicked his tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He regarded the man in front of him with a hint of amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This guy was just a semi-well-known street tough. Compared to real heavyweights like multi-millionaire Caroline, he was a nobody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if played right, he could be a useful pawn for Alistair to deal with Liam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at the moment, this so-called "pawn" was turning against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair wasn't the least bit intimidated by this so-called fearsome street tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd always been the model student in the eyes of teachers and parents, never getting into fights. But that didn't mean he'd cower when trouble came knocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the power of the Body Fortification Pill surging through his veins, he felt like he could take on the world. He was pretty confident he could take down ten Aarons on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, he figured there'd be no need for a brawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair casually asked, "Did Celeste send you?"</span></p></div>
