        <h1>Chapter 154 Eloise Wanted a Little Brother</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's concert went on as scheduled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amusingly enough, he sent Caroline several tickets, prime seats, nearly impossible to buy even at outrageous prices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew she wouldn't attend. The gesture was more symbolic than anything, a quiet offering of goodwill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, footage of the concert lit up every major streaming platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of mild curiosity, Alistair wondered how Leo had managed to perform with that bruise still fresh on his face. After a quick search, he found that Leo had cleverly used exaggerated stage makeup to cover it up. The quirky new look was so different from his usual style that it actually sparked a wave of buzz and fascination among his fans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since helping Leo finally recognize the disturbing level of control Paige held over his life, things had been calm for Alistair and Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just after nine in the evening when Eloise drifted off to sleep, clutching her small brown teddy bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Caroline brought Eloise home, she had bought her countless toys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she had been juggling school and the early stages of her career, often relying on others to help care for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One evening, on her way home, she passed by a shop and spotted the bear. She bought it on a whim, hoping to cheer Eloise up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered smiling as she handed it to her daughter and saying, "See this little brown bear? This is Mommy. When I'm not around, it'll stay with you, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise had only been a little over a year old then, but after so much time and effort, she had already begun forming an attachment to Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline wasn't sure whether Eloise had fully understood those words, but at some point, she began noticing that Eloise would only fall asleep with the bear in her arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, the little bear became her comfort object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wherever they stayed, it came with them. Without it, Eloise would cry herself into a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline, always cautious, had quietly ordered an entire box of identical bears&mdash;just in case it ever went missing. But to this day, the original bear had never let them down. It had stayed faithfully by Eloise's side, night after night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gently stroked Eloise's chubby little hand and then adjusted her blanket, tugging it up to her chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since learning the truth about her parentage, he'd become the kind of dad who couldn't stop hovering over his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His feelings were... complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Caroline had already assured him she would never tell Leo the truth, and even if Leo somehow found out, she would never let him take Eloise away, Alistair still couldn't shake a lingering sense of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hands came to rest softly on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline leaned down behind him, the faint scent of her body wash wrapping around him like a warm net. She lowered her voice near his ear, feigning a pout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So now that you've got your baby girl, you don't want your big girl anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if that were even possible. Both his girls were his whole world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled Caroline into his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave a small protest, frowning as she tried to wriggle free. "Alistair, really? In front of our daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's asleep," he said shamelessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Caroline settled against him, they flipped through the drawings Eloise had done earlier that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a little bookworm already, with the makings of a gifted student. Her old man couldn't have been prouder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also loved to draw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever she had a free moment, she'd sit quietly at her tiny desk and sketch. Her favorite subjects were a handsome man, a long-haired lady, and a little girl with a bun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their little family of three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drawings were childish but undeniably endearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But tonight, she'd added a new character&mdash;a cute little boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, the definition of "cute" or "handsome" in Eloise's drawings required a bit of imagination. But Alistair had asked out of genuine curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's this little guy?" he'd said, pointing at the sketch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise had looked up from her coloring and answered with perfect seriousness, "That's my little brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He blinked. "You have a brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His first thought was that she was referring to one of Caroline's relatives' kids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Eloise, still coloring the boy's clothes, said dreamily, "I will. Someday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then it hit him&mdash;she meant a baby brother, their baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Alistair showed Caroline the drawing and grinned. "This is our future son."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, daughters really were the best. Not only adorable and clever, but now she was out here subtly nudging them toward baby number two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline raised an eyebrow. "And what if it turns out to be a sister instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gender, after all, was a roll of the dice. Even the most powerful people couldn't control something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't there some saying that kids always guess right when it comes to baby siblings? If Eloise says it's a boy, maybe it really will be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline gave him a knowing look. "Pretty sure that would require me actually being pregnant first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smirked. "That can be arranged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with that, he scooped her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline yelped in surprise and instinctively looked toward Eloise, but the little girl was fast asleep. She gave him a playful swat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He set her back down gently, pinching her cheek with a chuckle. "Relax. I'm only teasing. You scare so easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned off the lamp on Eloise's nightstand, wrapped an arm around Caroline's shoulders, and quietly stepped out of the room with her in tow. This time, when he picked her up again, she didn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, Alistair woke to find Caroline already up, lying beside him, propped on one elbow, and quietly scrolling through her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his head just slightly and caught a glimpse of her screen. It was about Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's first concert in New York had wrapped up successfully, and the top five trending searches on social media were all about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His quirky stage makeup had initially topped the list, but it had now been overtaken by others with hashtags: "Musical genius' childhood sweetheart is Giselle", "Leo's wedding soon" and "Giselle's birthday party".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair raised an eyebrow.</span><br><span>Really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Caroline, she definitely wasn't interested in Leo's love life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photos showed a woman in her mid-twenties, perfectly made up, smiling brightly, and radiating confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The media described her as a princess of high society, Leo's childhood sweetheart, and the heiress to Reeves Group. Her name was Giselle Reeves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past two years, Reeves Group had been on a meteoric rise. Its chairman had held second place on the billionaire rankings for two consecutive years, considered by many to be Gordon's only serious rival for the top spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair made a quick mental connection. Caroline came from a privileged background herself. She might not be on good terms with her family, but that didn't change the circles she belonged to. If anyone would know Giselle, it was her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was right. Caroline did know Giselle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the same girl who had once snuck into Caroline's room and opened the box her mother had left behind without permission.</span></p></div>
