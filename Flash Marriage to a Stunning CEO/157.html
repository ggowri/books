        <h1>Chapter 157 Hitchhiking</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone exchanged glances, wondering if this was the surprise Giselle had prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so, it was certainly shocking&mdash;though hardly pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It quickly became clear from Giselle's mortified expression and the tears welling in her eyes that this wasn't a planned surprise&mdash;it was an accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the party coordinator shouted to cut the livestream and someone rushed to help Giselle away, everyone's suspicions were confirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had thrown exactly 25 birthday parties. This was the first time anything like this had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her parents recovered quickly. Facing their bewildered guests with awkward smiles, they explained that Giselle was simply playing a prank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody bought it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had always cultivated the image of a refined, accomplished young woman. Why would she suddenly abandon all decorum and humiliate herself in front of everyone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since the hosts were brushing it off, the guests couldn't press the issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, an uncomfortable tension lingered over the party. Giselle never reappeared, and by nine o'clock, most guests had departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had arrived with Yves, who now felt obligated to drive him home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks, but I've got a ride," Alistair said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves assumed Alistair was just being polite, smiling, "A ride? With whom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in the middle of nowhere&mdash;no taxis, no buses. Unless he'd called an Uber, but even then, who knew how long it would take?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being single with no family obligations, Yves insisted on driving Alistair home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My wife," Alistair replied, his smile carrying just a hint of smugness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves blinked in surprise. "Your wife's here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right on cue, a Rolls-Royce pulled up beside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian stepped out and opened the rear door for Alistair with an exaggerated flourish, bowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair cringed at the theatrics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves clearly didn't run in Caroline's circles and had no idea who Julian was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he would have immediately realized that Alistair's wife was the president of Vireon Technologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Julian's mischievous gaze, Alistair said goodbye to Yves and slid into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline watched Yves through the window until Alistair got in, then turned her full attention to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alistair buckled his seatbelt, he asked, "Why didn't I see you at the party?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you guess I'd be here? Is that why you came with Mr. Robinson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Partly," Alistair admitted. "But also because Mr. Robinson's always been good to me. I felt bad turning him down again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline narrowed her eyes slightly, a silent warning to choose his words carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But mostly," Alistair added quickly, "I thought you'd be here. I wanted to create a chance meeting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, immune to their displays of affection by now, interjected with a grin, "Hoping to surprise Ms. Ashbourne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Turns out Carol was the one with surprises," Alistair said, glancing at Caroline with something clearly on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just say it," Caroline said. "It's only us here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True enough&mdash;even if he was overthinking things, there was no one around to mock his overactive imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About Giselle falling in the water..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I pushed her," Caroline said before he could finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's eyes widened slightly as he studied his calm wife. "You didn't get hurt, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"'Getting hurt' is no longer in my book," Caroline replied matter-of-factly. "Shouldn't you be asking why I pushed her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wasn't sure if Julian knew about the history between Caroline and Giselle and preferred not to discuss it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to his wife pushing someone into a pool, he cared far more about whether she'd been harmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other people's problems weren't his concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure you had your reasons," he said simply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian made a mental note.</span><br><span>When I get a girlfriend, as long as it's not a matter of principle, always put her first. Maybe then my love life won't be a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's thoughts turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had humiliated Giselle publicly, embarrassing Reeves Group. They'd surely retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Caroline was an Ashbourne, she wasn't the favored daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing her complete lack of concern, Alistair relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her youth, Caroline had a compelling presence that inspired confidence. She seemed to have everything under control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she'd decided to push Giselle, she'd clearly already planned for the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After most guests had departed, Giselle's parents inquired, "Giselle, what happened today? Why did you&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This year's party had been their most elaborate yet. They'd planned to announce her takeover of Stellar Films and leverage the online buzz to link her with Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her fall into the pool had ruined everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giselle had changed into dry clothes, but her hair remained disheveled, her eyes red and puffy from crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been adored since childhood, the picture of grace and nobility. To suddenly become a laughingstock was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A woman pushed Ms. Reeves," said a young woman in a white gown, her makeup delicate. "I saw it happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Anne, whom Alistair knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a minor actress, Anne shouldn't have rated an invitation to Giselle's party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had another identity&mdash;the daughter of a prominent New York entrepreneur.</span></p></div>
