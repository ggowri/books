        <h1>Chapter 22 Stay Away From My Husband</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise's lips quivered as she fought back tears.<br>This lady is so mean! She is not as pretty as Mom and not as gentle either. She is like an angry monster!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She timidly hid behind Alistair, who protectively wrapped an arm around her shoulders. Eloise immediately felt safe again.<br>Daddy will protect me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair's face darkened with anger. "Rebecca, what the hell is wrong with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before Rebecca could respond, a stunningly beautiful woman with an elegant figure and exceptional poise approached them. She deliberately took Alistair's arm right before Rebecca, fixing her with an icy stare. "Excuse me," she said mockingly, "I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your distance from my husband, or I'll be forced to take less pleasant measures."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca stood frozen in shock as she watched the family of three walk away from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Did I mistake someone else for Alistair? Did I confuse a man who looks like him with the real Alistair?" she questioned herself. "No, that can't be right. He is Alistair&mdash;he called me by name without hesitation!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca felt her mind spinning as she stood there, completely disoriented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How was this possible? In just one day, Alistair suddenly had a wife and child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maybe she'd somehow slipped into a parallel universe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca's thoughts were a jumbled mess. Feeling desperate and confused, she finally decided to call Vivienne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Vivienne was exasperated when she saw Rebecca's name on her phone.<br>Hadn't we agreed to never speak to each other again? It hadn't even been that long, and now she was calling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She reluctantly answered the call, only to hear Rebecca rambling incoherently, asking if she knew about Alistair having a wife and children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Vivienne was utterly stunned. She wondered if Rebecca was having some kind of breakdown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could Alistair have a wife and kids when he had just divorced her? Setting aside their bitter history momentarily, she asked with genuine concern, "Rebecca, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Daddy, who was that scary lady?" Eloise asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked back and breathed a huge sigh of relief when she saw Rebecca hadn't followed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair gently stroked her head. "Don't be afraid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His body had gone rigid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could barely coordinate his steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's perfume filled his nostrils with every breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His entire left side felt numb&mdash;if this continued, he might end up paralyzed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline was still holding onto his left arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The gesture brought her upper body uncomfortably close to his. Through their light spring clothing, he could feel the softness of her body. Anyone watching them would assume they were an affectionate married couple or lovers walking intimately together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline stole a glance at Alistair. Her eyes traveled from his collar to his neck, then to his Adam's apple, finally settling on his ear, which was just inches away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Under the streetlight, Alistair's earlobes had turned so red they looked like they might drip blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pressed her lips together, struggling to suppress the smile that threatened to spread across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wasn't he supposed to be a divorced man with a five-year-old son? Why was he acting like an innocent teenager who had never been close to a woman before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She reluctantly released his arm. As her soft body moved away, Alistair felt like he could breathe again. He exhaled a long, silent sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she hadn't let go, Alistair was sure he might have suffocated to death in the next second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though Caroline appeared delicate on the surface, her aura was domineering and aggressive. When she approached him, Alistair felt the surrounding air grow thin, making it almost impossible for him to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment she left, the air immediately returned to normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Was she...?" Caroline feigned hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah." Alistair nodded apologetically. "Sorry, she scared you both."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline smiled, "I'm not that easily frightened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked down at Eloise, who walked on Alistair's other side. "Eloise, don't be scared. That lady isn't quite right up here," she said, tapping her temple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise uttered a sympathetic "Oh," and innocently asked, "Why doesn't she see a doctor then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline seemed to think of something and turned to look at Alistair. "I hope you don't mind me saying that. But her mental state did seem a bit concerning, didn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair shook his head. "Why would I mind? She's just a psycho&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He swallowed the curse word, remembering Eloise standing right there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline said softly, "It must be tough for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair took a moment to process what was happening when a pleasant, subtle perfume enveloped him. Caroline leaned in close and whispered so only he could hear, "Living with her must be exhausting. Don't worry, I won't make things so difficult for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise looked up at her parents, whispering together, and felt a surge of happiness.<br>Mom and Dad get along so well! I don't have to worry anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise had walked quite a distance today. By the end, her little legs could barely keep moving. Alistair simply picked her up without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Surprisingly, Eloise wasn't grateful for the help. "I'm not tired at all, Dad! Mom's the one who's tired. Why don't you carry her instead? Mom needs a hug."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite knowing children speak their minds without filters, he still felt embarrassed by her suggestion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise turned to Caroline. "Mom, are you tired?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair expected Caroline to deny it, but to his surprise, she nodded with a soft "Mmm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair couldn't find words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline gave him a playful glance, a fleeting teasing look in her eyes. "But Mom can push through a little longer. I'm too heavy, and it would be too much work for Dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca returned home in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard had already brought Daniel back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked somewhat exhausted, lacking experience in childcare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If not for the fact that Daniel was his biological son, Richard might have lost his temper today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That little troublemaker was simply too much to handle!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Rebecca arrived, Richard finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Rebecca, Danny needs... Rebecca, what are you thinking about so intensely?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Huh? Oh, it's nothing," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca certainly couldn't tell Richard she was lost in thoughts about Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She hadn't gotten the answers she wanted from Vivienne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Over the phone, Vivienne had once again solemnly assured her that there was nothing between her and Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She confirmed inviting Alistair to her home that day to cook a meal for Miranda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for anything else, Vivienne claimed it was all in Rebecca's imagination and had nothing to do with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Regarding Rebecca's mention of Alistair having a beautiful wife and a daughter about Daniel's age, Vivienne expressed surprise and gently suggested Rebecca might have mistaken someone else for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca knew she couldn't have mistaken his identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could she possibly confuse a man she had spent six years with?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although tonight's Alistair did seem remarkably different from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After picking at the dinner Richard had prepared and finally getting the rambunctious Daniel to bed, Rebecca sat on the couch with her knees pulled to her chest. Her mind replayed the image of that striking woman clinging to Alistair's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's words echoed in Rebecca's mind. "He is my husband."</p></div>
