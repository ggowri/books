        <h1>Chapter 197 Paled in Comparison</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Don't worry. This is between me and her. I won't drag you into this.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[I'm gonna go stab her right now!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stared at the stream of texts popping up on his phone and tried to soothe the man: [You might get your revenge, but have you thought about your parents and family?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, the man sent a text back: [So what should I do now?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair let out a sigh of relief. Thankfully, the man still had a shred of rationality left. Otherwise, it would have been really hard to control the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His counter-attack had officially begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was in for a rough time. Today, he'd sent the man to her. To get rid of him, Paige had shelled out 10 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was an incredibly shrewd woman. There was no way Paige would just fork out 10 million dollars to that guy without having some dirt on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the man wasn't after the 10 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a decade ago, he was the youngest department head in the history of his sector, full of ambition and with a smooth-sailing career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, overnight, he crashed from the peak to the bottom. His career was ruined, and he ended up disabled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of his despair, he sank into depression. He looked a decade older than his actual age. If his family hadn't kept a close eye on him, he would have taken his own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only now did he learn that what happened over a decade ago wasn't a simple mistake on his part. Someone had deliberately pushed him </span><span>toward</span><span> ruin, and that someone was his once-respected senior, Paige!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With solid evidence in front of him, he had no choice but to believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing more painful than having something within one's grasp, or within reach if one worked hard, only to have it snatched away by someone's malicious intent. Who wouldn't be filled with hatred?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd lost his innocence, dignity, and future&mdash;his entire life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he wanted was Paige dead, to avenge the life that had been shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the mysterious person who'd spilled the beans told him to cool his jets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the guy was probably using him, but he didn't give a damn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he was grateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for this mystery man, he'd still be in the dark, like a total sap, thanking Paige, the one who'd seemed to stick by him after his downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mysterious one restored his long-lost dignity. Even in death, he'd have no confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, the mysterious man, wrapped up guiding the guy over the phone. He put the phone down, got up, and made his way to the door. He cracked it open quietly and peeked out, his eyes wandering </span><span>toward</span><span> the large desk in the spacious office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, sweetie. Fancy some afternoon coffee?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had her elbows propped on the shiny desk, her chin resting on one hand. She tilted her head and looked at him, twirling a pen idly with the other. Clearly, she'd been waiting for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was momentarily at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, there was a knock on the door. Alistair mouthed, "Don't wanna mess with your work," and slipped into the lounge, closing the door tightly behind him. It was obvious he was dead-set on staying out of his wife's corporate affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lounge was well-soundproofed. Once the door was shut, he couldn't hear anything from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair lay back on the sofa, his head on the cushion, and stared blankly at the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige deserved to die, and a thousand times over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the most vicious woman Alistair had ever met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to her, Rebecca and Celeste were just amateurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were indeed hateful, but at least they'd only hurt strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige, on the other hand, had hurt her own flesh and blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was truly hard to believe that the discord in Caroline's parents' relationship was directly related to Paige!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had had enough of that vicious woman. He was dead-set on avenging his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd cooked up a perfect, airtight plan and was confident Paige would walk right into it, like a lamb to the slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, there was a knock on the lounge door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline walked in and said, "There's an AI Technology Innovation Expo at 2 PM. Come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, honey. I'd be thrilled to tag along with my incredible wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was taken aback. This would be his first public appearance with Caroline, no, the president of Vireon Technologies. The idea of standing beside his wife in front of a crowd got his blood pumping a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then it dawned on him. "So, who am I supposed to be there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lounge was a multi-functional space that combined the functions of a living room, a study, a bedroom, and a cloakroom. Caroline opened the wardrobe. Apart from two sets of home clothes for taking naps, all the rest were suits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somehow, there were now several sets of custom-made men's suits, a few shirts, and several ties of different colors. No doubt, they were all for Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline rummaged through the wardrobe, picked out the clothes she'd chosen for Alistair, and said, "Wear this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a dark blue suit paired with a white shirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was like a robot following instructions. He quickly took off his own clothes and put on the new ones. Caroline tied his tie herself, then patted him in satisfaction. "You look so handsome. What identity? Of course, you're going as my husband. What else did you have in mind? Do you wanna steal Julian's job?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair laughed, "Julian's job isn't something just anyone can do. I can't take it from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had their own expertise, and Alistair was self-aware enough to know he couldn't replace Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline slipped into a professional suit that matched Alistair's. The suit managed to capture her delicate and gentle allure while also emphasizing her decisive and powerful presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cinched waist of the suit perfectly hugged her slender mid-section, and the well-tailored suit pants showcased her long, shapely legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair slung his arm around her, and they stood in front of the dressing mirror, grinning. "Looks like we're rocking couple outfits," he said with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline swatted his hand away from her waist. "You're wrinkling my clothes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair pretended to be heartbroken, clutching his chest as if he were about to launch into an over-the-top performance. But in an instant, Caroline stood on her tiptoes, cupped his face, and planted a firm kiss on his lips. "Silly hubby," she murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair just grinned and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had pulled that fake-out move on him countless times, and yet he always fell for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't mind being "tricked" at all, because he knew Caroline only had his best interests at heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The AI Technology Innovation Expo was set up to give the public a hands-on experience of AI technology's development. It aimed to help folks get a feel for how AI was going to turn their lives upside down.</span></p></div>
