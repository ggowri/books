        <h1>Chapter 10 Have a Dad</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair got up from his king-sized bed, took a shower, and finished breakfast. Right on schedule, he went downstairs to find a Maybach waiting at the curb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline sat in the back seat, gesturing for him to join her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He slid in beside her. "Did you get here early?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline closed her laptop. "No, just arrived. Your timing is perfect."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They drove to City Hall in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Getting married was supposed to be a sacred, beautiful moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But for Alistair, the whole thing felt like some kind of joke. He was divorced yesterday and married today, like children playing house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more he thought about it, the more ridiculous it seemed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The funniest part was that the woman processing their marriage certificate was the exact same lady who had handled his divorce from Rebecca just yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her eyes lit up when she saw Caroline. "Well, aren't you a pretty young girl!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The appreciation of beauty was universal. Women were just as quick to notice a gorgeous face as any man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The clerk instinctively glanced at the man standing beside Caroline. "Young man, your wife is absolutely gorgeous. You're so... lucky." Her voice trailed off as recognition dawned on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair smiled politely, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once they had the marriage certificate, Alistair stared at their photo, bewildered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Second marriage, just like that? The universe really has a weird sense of humor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you done admiring it?" Caroline snatched the certificate from his hand before he could answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair wanted to point out that she had her own copy, but kept quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline stacked both certificates together and tucked them into her purse. "I'll keep these safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair couldn't argue with that. They walked out of City Hall together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I need to head to the office," she said. "You can go back to the hotel for now. I'll pick you up after work and take you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair's foot landed on the last step when her words stopped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline turned, giving him a puzzled look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He swallowed hard against the sudden lump in his throat when she casually mentioned taking him home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since his grandfather died, the concept of "home" had disappeared from Alistair's world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even after he'd "made a home" with Rebecca, it had never really been his, just hers. At best, it had been nothing more than a cage that trapped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline walked ahead, her ponytail catching the bright sunlight, which bathed it in a golden glow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, Alistair found himself looking forward to this new marriage with unexpected hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Ashbourne..." he called out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Still calling me Ms. Ashbourne?" Her tone was light, without any real criticism behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair corrected himself. "Carol?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It felt strange calling her by name for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The corner of Caroline's mouth twitched upward slightly. "That works too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What does she mean by that? What else would she want me to call her&mdash;"honey"?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair knew he couldn't bring himself to use that word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They might technically be husband and wife now, but neither needed to be reminded why two strangers had suddenly rushed into marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What were you going to tell me earlier?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh right&mdash;I have something to take care of tomorrow at noon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Will you be back home for dinner?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I should be back by afternoon if everything goes smoothly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caroline's eyes crinkled slightly. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I should be back by afternoon if everything goes smoothly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline's eyes crinkled slightly. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But just as he was about to leave, Caroline couldn&rsquo;t help calling after him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alistair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah?" He turned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Standing by the car, she changed her mind about what she wanted to say. "Never mind. I just wanted to tell you not to prepare anything. I'll have everything arranged. Just bring yourself when you come back in the afternoon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair nodded. "Alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, something occurred to him. "Who's picking up Eloise from school? I'm not busy, so I could do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The whole point of his marriage to Caroline was to be a father to Eloise and create a stable family environment for her, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Eloise isn't at kindergarten today," Caroline explained. "She's with my grandmother. I'll pick her up this afternoon before coming to get you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline arranged for the driver to drop Alistair off at his five-star hotel before heading to her office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The city streets blurred past the car window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline rested her head against her hand, staring absently out the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One thing had become clear to her yesterday&mdash;Alistair's first marriage had been deeply unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today, she was developing another theory. His ex-wife must have been extremely controlling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline felt almost bewitched. From the moment she'd first seen Alistair, she couldn't stop herself from wanting to figure him out. She had this nagging feeling they'd met before, but couldn't place where or when.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Richard returned with Daniel, he was greeted by complete chaos. His first thought was that he'd walked into the wrong house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca glanced at them, then at the clock, suddenly realizing she'd waited a full three hours for Alistair after promising herself just 10 minutes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">During that time, she'd smashed her collection of expensive cosmetics from the vanity, shattered a vase, and broken several pricey imported wine bottles from the cabinet. If she hadn't gotten tired, she might have torn down the whole place!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All because Alistair had the nerve to block her number!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca was absolutely furious, desperate to find Alistair and unleash her anger. Then it hit her&mdash;she had no way to reach him anymore...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What happened here?" Richard asked, completely stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca immediately regretted not cleaning up before they got home. Now her old flame had seen her ugly, explosive side. How could she explain this? She could hardly say she'd destroyed their home because Alistair wouldn't do what she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Besides, Alistair wasn't part of her life anymore. He had no reason to follow her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca understood the logic, but deep down, she was convinced that Alistair should obey her and only her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She made up a flimsy excuse. "Alistair left his fingerprints all over these things. They just feel dirty to me now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reason was pretty weak, but thankfully, it was enough to get by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard called a cleaning service to handle the mess while Rebecca held her son close, feeling his forehead with concern. "Sweetie, are you still feeling bad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel was dragging himself around like a deflated balloon. That playful kid who couldn't sit still was nowhere to be found. "Mom, my throat feels like I swallowed broken glass."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca kissed his forehead reassuringly. "It'll be okay. Just take your medicine on time and you'll feel better soon. We'll have your dad make you some chicken noodle soup&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stopped abruptly mid-sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard heard her and responded cheerfully, "Sure thing, Danny! I will make you some chicken noodle soup myself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca lowered her eyes, feeling guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The "dad" she was referring to was actually Alistair...</p></div>
