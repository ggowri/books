        <h1>Chapter 115 No Match</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca always felt a sense of helplessness when facing Caroline, as if her entire body lacked strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was no match for Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It made her deeply anxious, resentful, and fearful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this wasn't just a simple conflict. She understood clearly that if she backed down now, it would mean losing Alistair forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel's question from that morning unexpectedly echoed in Rebecca's mind. He asked, "Mom, when will Dad come home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if only for Daniel's sake, she had to fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca found herself a noble justification and instantly felt her body fill with strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she looked back at Caroline, her eyes blazed with fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone made mistakes. She had recognized her errors and was willing to make amends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was this venomous woman's appearance that had robbed her of the chance to set things right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline raised an eyebrow.</span><br><span>Well, well. What intense hostility!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, this killing intent in front of her was as childish as kids playing house&mdash;completely laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's fury shifted to a confident smile. "You and Alistair won't last."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline clicked her tongue. "Changing tactics now, are we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline had to admit, even though she knew this woman was deliberately trying to provoke her, when she heard those words, it still stung a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's complete nonsense! Who says Alistair and I won't last? Not only will we last, we'll be together forever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline smiled, effortlessly deflecting the attack, "I'm sorry to disappoint you, but Alistair and I are perfectly matched. We've already promised to be together for all eternity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's face turned ashen while Caroline smiled with delight, immediately making Rebecca realize she'd fallen into her trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca tried again. "He's just temporarily enchanted by you. Time reveals all truths. Once he discovers you're a violent savage who likes to use her hands, he'll definitely keep his distance from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline frowned, "Are you referring to when I slapped you twice last time? You want to tattle to him about that? I strongly suggest you don't let him know about this, otherwise..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca thought Caroline was afraid, and her heart leaped with joy. She believed Caroline was scared of Alistair discovering her true nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Rebecca was about to press her advantage and show Caroline who was boss, she noticed Caroline smirk as she continued, "Otherwise, if my honey finds out, he'll probably scold me for not slapping you a few more times when I had the chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca glared at her, eyes blazing with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline took her time finishing her drink, draining the glass with deliberate slowness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I were you," she advised with mock sympathy, "I'd go home, look in the mirror, and bury those thoughts about stealing someone else's husband. Then repeat to yourself a hundred times&mdash;stop reaching for what you can't have. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alistair spent six years around you and never fell in love. That clearly means you're not his type. Wouldn't it be better to face reality?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's hand trembled violently as she gripped her glass, fury building inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman wasn't just mocking her appearance but ridiculing her for lacking self-awareness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline stepped closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca instinctively backed away, maintaining her distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The memory of those two slaps had left an indelible psychological scar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing she'd shown weakness, Rebecca grew even more humiliated and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hold your glass steady," Caroline warned with false concern. "If even a drop splashes onto me, two slaps won't be enough to settle things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After delivering this reminder, Caroline gracefully brushed past her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly realized she'd stooped to an absurd level, wasting her breath on this woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, occasionally teasing such a fool did provide some entertainment to brighten her mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's chest heaved with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took every ounce of self-control she possessed not to throw her glass directly at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian finished his conversation with tonight's potential partner, confirmed the location for signing the contract, then turned and walked toward Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You seem to be in a good mood," he said, unconsciously glancing behind Caroline before his expression slightly changed. "Rebecca? You two..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline walked toward the exit. "Don't worry, we won't come to blows&mdash;and even if we did, I wouldn't be the one getting hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian shook his head with a smile. That was certainly true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Walking beside Caroline, he lowered his voice. "I just saw Nathaniel in the venue, but he pretended not to see me and didn't come over to chat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because he thinks a partnership with Vireon Technologies is hopeless, so he doesn't bother being friendly?" Caroline immediately dismissed her theory. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, he wants to find an opportunity to meet me directly but isn't sure which one is me. He's apprehensive about your dismissal once more, which is why he won't reveal his presence until he's utterly certain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian gave Caroline a thumbs-up, knowing nothing could hide from her perceptive eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I suspect we're going to have a chance encounter with Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield as soon as we leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When we go out, keep some distance between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Ashbourne, if you don't want to work with him, couldn't you just brush him off with a few words? Is it really necessary to go to such lengths to avoid him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's not it. I want you to watch a fantastic show. Don't worry, it's free of charge, just for your entertainment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A show?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's mischievous gaze made Julian's eyelids twitch nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Well, someone is about to have a very bad day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the venue, Nathaniel immediately began searching for Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he spotted him engaged in conversation with others, he decided not to approach right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He scanned the room in all directions but didn't see anyone who could be Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From what he knew, Caroline was a young, brilliant woman with innovative ideas. Currently, Julian was surrounded only by two glamorous women who were clearly trying to catch his attention, with no other women nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Nathaniel's imagination, the female CEO of Vireon Technologies would be an ordinary-looking woman with practical short hair and thick glasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd received information that Caroline would be attending today, but without knowing exactly who she was, he hesitated to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was eager to meet Caroline in person to discuss the potential collaboration between their companies after receiving a rejection at Vireon Technologies earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He assumed that Caroline was simply too young and had been misled by companies competing with Whitfield Group. Given the chance, he was confident he could secure a partnership with Vireon Technologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel had been discreetly monitoring Julian's every move but unfortunately got held up by a former partner. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time he regained his focus, Julian had already left the venue. He hastily called for Rebecca and rushed out in pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then witnessed Julian entering a nearby restaurant with a man and a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel looked contemplative. "It seems Ms. Ashbourne has business matters to discuss tonight. Let's wait here. Rebecca, why do you look so upset?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's eyes welled up with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel had doted on Rebecca since childhood, so he immediately felt concerned at her look. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did someone mistreat you? Who was it?"</span></p></div>
