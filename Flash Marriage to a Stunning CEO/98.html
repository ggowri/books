        <h1>Chapter 98 The Only Ray of Light</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was certain that someone had entered this two-story house, which was said to have been unoccupied for over a decade. All he had to do was push open the courtyard gate, stride in, and he'd come face-to-face with the person inside. Then, through a conversation, he could delve deeper into the questions nagging at his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it wasn't proper for him to barge into a private property like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After some thought, Alistair made his way to the front door, raised his hand, and knocked. Soon, someone came to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a burly man with a hairy face. His expression was stony as he asked, "What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the man's uninviting demeanor, Alistair flashed a polite smile and described Caroline's appearance, asking if he knew her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hairy-faced man replied that they knew nothing about the previous occupants and hadn't seen the girl Alistair was talking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair hadn't held high hopes anyway. After all, the elderly couple residing in the backyard knew this house as well as, if not better than, anyone else. So, if they were in the dark about certain aspects of it, it was a safe bet that others would be too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, without much disappointment, he thanked the man politely and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe Caroline just has low blood sugar. I must have been over-sensitive and made a wrong assumption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Alistair looked back up at the second floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The balcony on the second floor was enclosed with glass, and the faded, gaudy-patterned curtains were drawn tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But right then, the fluttering curtains made him recall a time when he'd caught a "peeping Tom" in his own backyard. The curtains had swayed in the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was absolutely sure that there was someone standing behind those curtains on the second-floor balcony. And this person had been secretly watching him through the curtain slits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Caught in the act and quickly hid behind the curtains. Who could it be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A strange flutter stirred in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is it that poor kid who was trapped on the second floor all those years ago?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Alistair had never seen the kid's face, he felt a rare sense of curiosity and kinship toward him, perhaps because the kid had, in a way, been a part of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's up there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did he recognize me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But it seems he still doesn't want to see me. Otherwise, why would he have yanked the curtains shut the moment I looked up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had an urge to turn back and meet this person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hairy-faced man looked at him curiously. "Do you still have something to ask?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the man's guarded expression, Alistair apologized and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the journey of life, one crossed paths with countless strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps it was the unconventional way this person had stepped into his world that made Alistair's thoughts keep lingering on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind the curtains, Caroline's heart was thumping like a drum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So close! I nearly got caught by him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hairy-faced man came back. "Ms. Ashbourne, why don't you go out and see Mr. Harlow? It's clear as day he came here for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's face turned serious. "I... I don't want his pity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was extremely sharp-witted. From her one-off strange behavior, he'd managed to figure out her possible link to this house and then tracked her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was well aware that he cared about her. How could she not fall head over heels for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her mind drifted back to the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That kind-hearted boy who, despite the unseemly situation, had looked up at her and greeted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd almost reciprocated his kindness but held herself back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was terrified that if she did, the only ray of light that had seeped into her otherwise dull world would be snuffed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam was completely at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trying to scrape together five million dollars in just two days was giving him a major migraine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The family's savings amounted to just a bit over 300 thousand dollars, and that money was firmly in Celeste's control. Even if he could somehow get his hands on it, it would be a drop in the bucket compared to the five-million-dollar debt looming over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Selling the house within two days was next to impossible. And even if he managed to pull it off, it wouldn't come anywhere near fetching the five million dollars he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam was once again painfully aware of just how much Alistair loathed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the very start, Alistair had no intention of giving him an escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time was running out, and he had to come up with five million dollars in just two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam was like a cat on a hot tin roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seems like there's no other way but to borrow from loan sharks. No, wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could I forget? I have another son...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately called Caleb, asking, "Hey, Caleb. How's your relationship with your girlfriend these days? Oh, it's stable? That's great. Your mom's been looking forward to having a grandkid. Hahaha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Listen, Caleb. I've got something to tell you. Promise me you won't get all worked up, and don't go asking your mom about it. Just act like you don't know anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your mom hasn't been feeling well. She had a check-up at the hospital, and... well, the situation isn't good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Liam actually choked up, sounding genuinely emotional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The doctor says she needs to have surgery as soon as possible, or... The thing is, you know how it is at home. I wouldn't be asking you this if it weren't an absolute last resort. Your girlfriend's family is pretty well-off, right? Do you think you could... Well, if not, it's okay. I'll do whatever it takes, even if it means selling everything we have. I can't just sit back and watch your mom die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'll give it a try? Great. Do it fast, Caleb. Your mom's surgery has to be scheduled soon. The hospital says there's a foreign doctor still in the country. If we're ready, they can arrange the surgery tomorrow, and the success rate is 100%... That's good to hear. I'm relieved knowing I can count on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, Caleb, keep it a secret. Your mom's a worrier. I'm afraid that if she finds out, it'll mess with her head and affect the surgery. I'll tell her it's just an appendectomy... Yeah, okay. Thanks to you, I don't know what I'd do otherwise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up, Liam let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thank goodness I haven't raised and invested in Caleb in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After coming back from studying abroad, Caleb had just started dating a rich girl from New York. Liam wasn't sure if her family was richer than Rebecca's, but one thing was for sure&mdash;she could easily fork out five million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celeste was constantly lost in daydreams of her son marrying into money. Caleb had made a grand promise that if he managed to bag a rich girlfriend, he'd ensure they lived like kings and queens.</span></p></div>
