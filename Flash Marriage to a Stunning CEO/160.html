        <h1>Chapter 160 The Obvious Suspect</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hospital corridor, Richard sat beside Rebecca, playing the part of the devoted, reliable boyfriend as she stared into nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone watching would have been fooled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Cordelia's surgeon finally came out and delivered the news&mdash;"I'm sorry. We did everything we could"&mdash;Richard barely managed to suppress his glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, when Nathaniel's surgeon emerged with better news&mdash;the operation was successful, he'd be moved to the ICU, and barring complications, he should pull through&mdash;Richard's fists clenched in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn it. He actually survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca, still reeling from her mother's death, found herself torn between grief and happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She crumpled to the floor, sobbing into her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard held her, rubbing her back in what appeared to be comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away from me!" She shoved him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard stared at the naked disgust on Rebecca's tear-streaked face, his expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't going according to plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Rebecca had handed Daniel over to him recently, he'd been thrilled, taking it as a sign she was ready to take him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that very night, he'd somehow been labeled a pervert. After throwing money at the problem to make it go away, he'd discovered Rebecca had disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd called, texted, and tried to explain it was all a misunderstanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she'd never responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worried that Rebecca was slipping out of their control, Richard's mother had taken Daniel abroad&mdash;insurance to keep Rebecca in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what they hadn't anticipated was Rebecca's complete silence about her son. From that day forward, she hadn't asked about Daniel once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard was finally beginning to understand, though he could hardly believe it. Was Rebecca actually abandoning Daniel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of her intentions, Daniel was of Morgan blood. Richard would claim him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What infuriated him was that even now&mdash;desperate, alone, with no one to turn to&mdash;Rebecca still refused to lean on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard dropped his caring act, his sneer ugly. "Don't push your luck, Rebecca. Who else gives a damn about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out," she rasped. "I don't need your care!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard settled back in his chair, crossing his legs casually. "Who are you hoping will care? Alistair?" he sneered. "Don't be naive. Haven't you wondered why this happened to your parents? You can't seriously think this was an accident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca went still. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smile turned vicious. "Come on, Rebecca. You're a smart woman. Stop playing dumb."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat frozen, her expression shifting from confusion to dawning horror. Her whole body began to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard savored her misery, only arranging his features into concern when someone passed by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bullshit!" Rebecca suddenly roared. "It couldn't be him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard scoffed, "Who else? You don't know what happened to his family? His dad's dead. His stepmother's in prison. Oh, and that little brother of his? Also died in a hospital not too long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each revelation, Rebecca's terror deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no! You're making this up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know I'm not. Rebecca, wake up. This isn't the old Alistair. I hear his wife is some big shot&mdash;someone neither of us can touch. Look what he did to his own family. Why would he spare you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard softened his expression. "I know I hurt you when we were young. But you moved on with Alistair. We're even. Let's start fresh and raise Danny together. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out, pulling her to her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca stood like a marionette, letting him guide her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry," he murmured in her ear. "I'm here. I won't let Alistair hurt you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him with hollow eyes. "Do you have proof that this is connected to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard sighed, "Isn't it obvious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's face crumbled, and her body was still trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard pulled her into his arms&mdash;only to be shoved away again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock flashed across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca bolted from the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't believe Richard. Despite how logical his theory sounded, she needed to hear the truth from Alistair himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alistair, the studio's pulling the plug on If There's a Next Second," Yves said over the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair felt no surprise, only the strange calm that came when a long-anticipated storm finally broke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves hesitated. "Don't you want to know why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you'd rather not say, then don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, Yves said, "We need to talk in person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they met, Yves explained why Stellar Films was abandoning the project. The studio had heard certain rumors about Alistair's personal life. They feared that using a script by a screenwriter with questionable ethics would risk their investment. After consideration, they'd decided to scrap the project and have the same crew film a different script.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, Alistair, we haven't known each other long, but I don't believe you're that kind of person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled bitterly, "But you never really know someone, do you? Aren't you worried you're wrong about me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves remained firm. "I trust my judgment. And I still hope we'll work together again. It's a real loss that audiences won't get to see If There's a Next Second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, they'll see it," Alistair said. "The question is whether you'll have the guts to direct it."</span></p></div>
