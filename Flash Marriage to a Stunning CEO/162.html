        <h1>Chapter 162 Trump Card</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Yves stood frozen in shock, the police took Alistair away for questioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca went with them as the victim's family member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves watched from the sidewalk as the police cars disappeared into traffic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He surprised himself with how calm he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News had already broken that he'd agreed to direct If There's a Next Second after Stellar Films dropped it. Now his fate was tied to Alistair's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alistair was convicted of murder-for-hire, both their careers would be finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves couldn't tell if his composure came from confidence in his choice or if Alistair's calmness had rubbed off on him. Either way, he found himself oddly unconcerned. Remembering Alistair's comment about "free publicity," he actually felt a spark of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Alistair was more formidable than he'd realized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After mulling it over, he headed off to prepare for casting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had been right. Thanks to all the free publicity, even with unknown actors, the film had generated massive buzz&mdash;perfect for next year's release.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stellar Films had handed their new project to his biggest rival. He must win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After days of investigation, police confirmed that Nathaniel and his wife's car accident was no accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair emerged as the prime suspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout an entire afternoon of interrogation, Alistair answered every question perfectly. Eventually, they released him due to insufficient evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he wasn't in the clear. He couldn't leave New York and had to remain available for further questioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair expressed his full cooperation in catching the real killer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he exited the police station, he spotted a familiar car waiting by the curb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone stood beside it, and when she saw him, she immediately opened the rear door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair quickened his pace, surprised&mdash;it was Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline examined him carefully. Seeing his relaxed demeanor, she embraced him. "That must have been rough, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever the optimist, Alistair quipped, "Not bad, actually. Character-building experience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline let out a mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, Alistair turned and understood immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca stood frozen on the sidewalk behind him, looking utterly broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She watched numbly as their car vanished into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's words from the police station echoed in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd said, "Rebecca, why would I risk my happiness now just to get back at your family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wandered toward the hospital in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard hovered nearby, putting on his usual show of bumbling devotion. "Rebecca, justice will prevail. He won't get away with this. The law will give us justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will it?" Rebecca murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she shed all her defenses and stubbornness, becoming just a lost, helpless woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard grabbed her hand. "Trust me. The law won't let the guilty escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca stared at him with empty eyes, then smiled strangely, "You're right. Justice always wins. Everyone who's done wrong will pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard met her gaze and felt his heart skip inexplicably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something in Rebecca's eyes&mdash;a piercing insight&mdash;seemed to see straight through him, reading his thoughts, uncovering secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he quickly composed himself, that split-second of evasion didn't escape her notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's heart sank. She asked immediately, "Richard, are you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard panicked.</span><br><span>She knows? Impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He denied it instantly. "What are you talking about? I don't understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca sneered, "Cut the act! You think I'm an idiot? Who benefits most from my parents' accident? Your family, obviously! Don't think I don't know you've been planning to use my family's assets to fix your own mess. You bastard&mdash;how dare you hurt my parents? I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's hint had made her think of Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he'd told her that her family wasn't worth sacrificing his happiness for revenge, he'd added, "Think carefully&mdash;who gains the most from your parents' accident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca clutched her head in anguish. The answer came too easily&mdash;Richard, who'd been desperately courting her lately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no proof, but after testing him, she was absolutely certain&mdash;Richard was behind her parents' accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she'd brought this on her parents herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she'd listened to their warnings instead of stubbornly being with Richard, none of this would have happened. Her life, her family&mdash;nothing would be shattered like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard was startled but quickly remembered his mother's reassurances about the other parties involved, how perfectly they'd covered their tracks, and how the police would never trace it back to them. He forced himself to stay calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rebecca, are you having a breakdown? Paranoid delusions? Seeing murderers everywhere? Remember&mdash;Alistair killed your parents!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage overtook Rebecca. She lunged at Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even in fury, a grieving woman was no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard caught her wrists as her nails raked his face. The stinging scratches pushed him over the edge. He finally realized gentle persuasion would never work on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enraged, Richard slapped her hard to shut her up, then played his ace. "I've been patient with you over and over&mdash;don't push it! You really think I enjoy groveling to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's eyes widened in horror at his phone screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were naked photos of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The background was unmistakable&mdash;the night she'd thrown Alistair out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world spun before Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd kicked Alistair out of her life... for this piece of trash?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her fear, Richard sneered, "Stop testing me! I was trying to keep things civil for Danny's sake, but you're too stupid to appreciate it! If you don't want these photos going viral, you'll do exactly what I say!"</span></p></div>
