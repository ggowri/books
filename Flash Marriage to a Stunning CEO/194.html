        <h1>Chapter 194 Raze the Whole World to the Ground</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where have you been these days?" Paige demanded, her voice laced with impatience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response, Leo slumped lazily onto the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Alistair been present, he'd have been flabbergasted. In just one night, Leo seemed to have shaken off the shackles of heartbreak. He was brimming with life and energy once more, the same charismatic and gifted music prodigy as before, though a bit thinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if deaf to his mother's worried query, he took the coffee from the butler, took a sip, then placed it on the table with a slight grimace, clearly unimpressed by the taste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Busy," he drawled nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was far from satisfied with this vague answer. "Busy with what? So busy that you can't even answer your phone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo dropped his gaze. "A secret operation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige stood in front of him, arms crossed, frowning as she sized him up. "What kind of secret operation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo flashed a smile. "It's called a secret for a reason. Can't tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not even your mom?" Paige said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo just grunted in reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige forced a smile. "So hush-hush? But I'm your mom. I won't do you any harm. I'm dying of curiosity. Just tell me, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo looked up, his eyes blankly fixed on Paige. His hand on the sofa unconsciously balled into a fist and then relaxed. A strange smile tugged at his mouth, a blend of mockery and something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that Paige noticed something was off about her son. First, she tugged at her mask to adjust it, then reached out to touch his forehead. "What's up? Not feeling okay? There're a ton of sick people around these days. If you're not feeling good, head to the hospital right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo turned his head away and said frostily, "I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige's hand hung awkwardly in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige had had a hunch that something wasn't right as soon as Leo stepped in. Now she finally put her finger on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was cold and seemed to brush her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, when he saw her wearing a mask at home, he'd know she was sick, rush over to show concern, pour her a glass of water, and help her take her meds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, even after her little nudge, he acted like he didn't even notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige felt a twinge of discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was going on? Had she become a pain in the ass to everyone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could put up with others disliking her, but how could her own son start to feel the same way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did that little bitch Caroline say something to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy looked up to Mabel a great deal. If he believed Caroline's bullshit and blamed Paige for Mabel's two hospital stays, he might hold a grudge against Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was filled with regret. If she'd known her plan would blow up in her face and make her the villain, she'd have never bothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no going back now. All she could do was try to find a way to make them forget about all this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suspecting that her son might be holding a grudge against her, Paige sat down beside him with a smile and said in a soft tone, "Okay, I get it. Work's important. If you don't wanna talk about it, that's cool. I'm just being curious. I know my boundaries. So, what do you feel like having for lunch? I'll tell the servants to fix it up. Where's Ezra? Call him over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo replied indifferently, "Ezra's moved on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige thought she'd misheard. "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo looked her in the eye. "I said Ezra quit and left New York to work in another city."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige shot up from her seat. "Why?! He was doing so great. Why would he quit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Leo with suspicion and said firmly, "He's been by your side for ages and was so loyal. He wouldn't just up and quit out of the blue. You fired him, didn't you? Leo, it's really tough to find someone who'll give it their all for you. That boy's an orphan. It's a real shame. If he did something wrong, I'll give him a piece of my mind. Just let him come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo retorted, "The world keeps turning without anyone. Without Ezra, I'm still me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige got mad seeing her son being so headstrong. "How old are you already? Can't you stop being so stubborn? Tell Ezra to come back. That's a mother's order!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's eyes turned icy cold. "Mom, at my age, can't I even decide who to fire as my assistant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was really ticked off by his sassy reply. "Is Ezra just some random guy? These days, it's so hard to find an assistant as honest and hard-working as him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo shot back, "But Miley doesn't like him. So I had to let him go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige was caught off guard. "Who the heck is Miley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hardly had the words slipped out of her mouth when her face went pale. She suddenly remembered who Miley was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Leo like she'd seen a ghost and scolded him, clearly disappointed, "After all these years, you're getting mixed up with that country girl again?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo held her gaze and retorted, "What's wrong with a country girl? Mom, didn't you say you'd respect all my choices and treat my future wife like your own daughter, no matter who she is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige realized she'd overreacted. Taking a deep breath to calm down, she said, "Of course I remember. I'm not against your choice. I just think it's not okay for her to meddle in your business so casually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo let out a sneer. "Since you get the point, why don't you follow your own advice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige looked utterly confused. "What on earth are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I talking about? Are you seriously asking me that?!" Leo roared and smashed the coffee cup right onto the table. The hot liquid splashed everywhere, some of it landing on Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige let out a high-pitched scream and instinctively took a few steps back, shouting, "What has gotten into you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo stared at her with bloodshot eyes and let out a bitter laugh. "So what if I've gone crazy? I'd even want to raze the whole world to the ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just couldn't keep up the pretense of a loving mother-son relationship with her anymore. After learning about Miley's death, at first he couldn't believe it. Then he'd gone frantically searching for confirmation. No one knew better than him what he'd been through these days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might seem normal on the outside, but only he knew that he was a walking corpse. His heart was as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miley was gone. She'd died during a difficult labor while carrying his child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How alone and hopeless she must have felt before she took her last breath!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miley must have hated him, thinking he was just a heartless womanizer... But that night, he'd planned to take her home to meet his parents the very next day. He'd wanted to be responsible for her. The moment he'd laid eyes on her, he'd felt an overwhelming urge to make her his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shouldn't have died. If she'd stayed in New York or any other hospital with good medical facilities, she wouldn't have died alone in that shabby rural clinic just because of a breech birth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The butler and servants, alarmed by the commotion, rushed in and stood there, looking at each other, not knowing what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo stopped laughing and said coldly, "This has nothing to do with you. Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige waved her hand angrily, her face ashen. Then she turned to Leo and demanded, "How could you become like this? Because of that Miley?"</span></p></div>
