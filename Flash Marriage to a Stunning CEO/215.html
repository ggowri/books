        <h1>Chapter 215 Why Wasn't It Me?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've said everything I came to say, so I won't take up any more of your time, Mr. Gordon Ashbourne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's purpose for visiting was simple&mdash;to make sure Gordon knew</span><span> exactly what Caroline had suffered at the hands of Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was Paige who had torn Gordon's family apart. He had every reason to despise her. If he didn't, he wouldn't have had her committed to a psychiatric facility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair wasn't about</span><span> to take any chances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if, one day, Gordon started feeling nostalgic about their sibling bond and decided to let her out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wasn't going to allow that to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His visit had one clear message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Gordon ever softened toward Paige, he could for</span><span>get about having Caroline as his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to choose&mdash;his deranged sister or his innocent daughter. There was no middle ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon sat in silence for a long while, eyes locked on Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course he heard the threat in his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, </span><span>suddenly, he let out a dry laugh, gaze narrowing. "And what if I do let her out? What will you do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't hesitate. "I'll make sure she doesn't walk free for long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Gordon, he looked like a cocky, fresh-faced kid still wet behind the ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But</span><span> he could tell Alistair wasn't just being impulsive or dramatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Alistair added, "With everything that's happened to me lately, I honestly don't think the Morgan family alone could've caused all this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon went quiet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair stood to l</span><span>eave, Gordon suddenly spoke, "Take good care of her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair paused in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's composed mask cracked slightly, and he let out a long, exhausted sigh. "I've failed at a lot of things in my life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a family pe</span><span>rspective, Gordon really had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out in the world, no one would call him that. He was a legendary entrepreneur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't send Paige there with any plans to take her out," Gordon continued. "People have to pay for what they've done. That flimsy diagnos</span><span>is may work in court, but not with me. It's nothing but a scrap of paper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Gordon Ashbourne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon closed his eyes, his voice hoarse. "Go handle your business. If you ever need anything, call me directly. No need to go through anyone else</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few seconds passed. Gordon opened his eyes again. "Why are you still here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gordon Ashbourne, I have a small favor to ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just say it. Enough with the 'Mr. Gordon Ashbourne' every time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's tone </span><span>softened. "It's about Caroline. She only recently started remembering what happened to her. She doesn't want anyone to know. Especially Mabel..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon gave a slow nod, his expression unreadable. "I can respect that. But I have to ask... How do you know s</span><span>o much about her past? I doubt she would've told you all that herself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's heart skipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No surprise there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She didn't tell me in full detail," he admitted. "But I only remembered recently... that I actually met Caroline over ten years ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wha</span><span>t do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before high school, I lived in Chicago. Back then, Caroline was locked up in the house right across the street from mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon stared at him, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just like that, a question that had long plagued him finally made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No </span><span>wonder Caroline had fallen for Alistair so quietly and so completely. Now he understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time in a long while, Gordon felt a sense of relief settle in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Alistair with newfound warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his daughter cared about this man that deep</span><span>ly, didn't that mean he had been her lifeline during that unbearable year?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt grateful to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Caroline&mdash;stubborn as she was&mdash;hadn't made it through that time, he would've lost both his wife and his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon didn't dare continue that tra</span><span>in of thought. His jaw clenched so tight it made his teeth ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paige!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Gordon's promise now secure, Alistair left the building feeling much lighter and dropped by the film set for a quick visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he walked, something made him pause. He glanced off </span><span>in the distance, frowning slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just spotted a thin, bony woman quickly squeezing her way onto a crowded city bus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore oversized sunglasses and a cap, her head tilted just low enough to keep her face hidden. He couldn't see her face at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't recognize her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really didn't...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bus was packed, standing room only. Rebecca held on to the metal pole, her fingers tightening with every lurch. She stole a glance out the window, trying to calm the thrum in her chest</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man she'd seen&mdash;the one who walked like he owned the world, glowing with confidence&mdash;was already gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a pang of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she'd spotted Alistair, she'd been too nervous and too mesmerized to even pull out her phone and take a </span><span>picture. She should've taken one&mdash;something to cling to during the long, aching nights when she missed him so badly it drove her mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There used to be pictures of him online. Most were blurry and didn't show his face clearly, but you could still tell it was</span><span> him from that tall, graceful frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca had secretly saved all the ones she could find, the few remaining scraps where his features weren't visible. At night, when everything was quiet, she'd take them out and stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she looked again later, t</span><span>here was nothing left. Everything had vanished overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashbourne family, clearly, had stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her stop arrived, Rebecca got off the bus and walked into the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside Nathaniel's room, she found someone unexpected&mdash;Vivienne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever </span><span>since Rebecca had once asked her to check in on him, Vivienne had come by whenever she had time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after their falling out, Vivienne still felt a sense of duty. Back when they were close, Nathaniel and Cordelia had treated her well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whitfield family</span><span>'s downfall had become a cautionary tale. Rebecca's story, once exposed, had accidentally cured more than a few hopeless romantics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now the two women stood in silence for a long time. Finally, Vivienne gave her a gentle pat on the shoulder, hesitating befo</span><span>re speaking. "Take care of yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just four plain words, but they hit like a punch to the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca broke down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She forced a shaky smile. "Thanks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne let out a quiet sigh. "I have to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca nodded and saw her out. Then she closed the do</span><span>or and returned to the side of Nathaniel's bed, sitting quietly, staring at his unconscious face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried for a long time. At some point, the tears simply ran dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She held his hand, memories flooding back&mdash;moments from her childhood when her parents had </span><span>protected her, spoiled her, and made her feel like a princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now she was sinking in hell, paying the price for every unforgivable choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the punishment she'd earned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't begged Alistair to take the responsibility when she fou</span><span>nd out she was pregnant... If she hadn't forced him to miss the SATs... If she'd just been a little wiser, a little more self-respecting... Her life wouldn't be what it was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could accept drowning in this hell. It was her punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why had her</span><span> parents been dragged into it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why wasn't it me who died in that car crash?</span></p></div>
