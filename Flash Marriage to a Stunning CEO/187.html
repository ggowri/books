        <h1>Chapter 187 A Perfect Day</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no such thing as a potion that could make someone young again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, joy was the best medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The false alarm about Mabel's illness had lifted an invisible weight off everyone's shoulders. Alistair had officially distanced himself from the Whitfield case. As for Mabel, she felt like a heavy weight had finally been lifted off her chest. The relief was visible in every movement she made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was actually planning to invent a youth potion for you when I grew up," Eloise said seriously. "But I guess now I don't need to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell silent after that, head bowed, fidgeting with her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people thought she was upset because someone else had beaten her to it, like she'd lost credit for the invention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a while, Eloise quietly added, "No... I was just thinking. If the medicine that made you young already exists, does that mean there's one that can keep my mom and dad young forever too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the mind of a five-year-old, anything was possible. No dream was too wild to chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, Mabel&mdash;suddenly energized and fully herself again&mdash;canceled her plans to go out. She couldn't bear the thought of spending the day away from Eloise. The little girl happily stayed the night at Ashbourne Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon, now certain the scare had passed, made a bold decision of his own. He postponed all work commitments to stay by Mabel's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd made more money than he or his family could ever spend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other moguls kept pushing themselves for the sake of their children. But Gordon only had one daughter, and she was brilliant, ambitious, and destined to surpass his lifetime's work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the personal satisfaction he got from business, he wouldn't have needed to keep grinding at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Alistair and Caroline didn't linger. They reminded Eloise to be good and left together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline was worn out. She started nodding off the moment they got in the car, and by the time they reached their building, she was fully asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't wake her. He simply carried her inside, holding her close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon might've fooled Mabel and Eloise, but not Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he was in custody, she'd worried that Alistair wasn't eating or sleeping well. What she didn't know was that he'd been worrying about her back home just the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them had rested much the night before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Alistair was strong. Sleep-deprived, sure, but he could hold it together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the door, laid Caroline gently on the couch, and then went to fill the tub. Tonight called for efficiency. A quick soak together, and then straight to bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed two sets of pajamas and came back out, only to find Caroline awake, sitting up lazily with her head tilted, right hand resting under her chin, sleepy eyes half-closed. She looked so dazed and soft he couldn't help himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over and rubbed her head twice, rough but affectionate. "Shower first," he said, "and then sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline leaned into him like melted butter, mumbling, "You're the best, babe. Thank you for everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was exhausted. After the bath, he lay down with her in his arms, her scent soft and sweet against his skin. With his head on the pillow and her body nestled close, he closed his eyes, completely at peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't believe in fairy tales. But some days still felt unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whitfield case was nearing its conclusion.</span><br><span>The facts were simple. The driver's cousin had a gambling addiction and mountains of debt. In desperation, he'd convinced his older cousin, the driver, who had untreated mental illness, to rob Cordelia and Nathaniel. The driver panicked and ended up killing them in the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It should've been straightforward. But because Alistair had been accused early on, the police were extra cautious. They refused to close the case until they'd exhausted every lead. No press updates, no loose ends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Gordon asked about it, Paige responded with perfect calm. She claimed she'd only heard about Alistair's arrest through a police officer friend who happened to be assigned to the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was all Gordon needed to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't confront her. Just smiled and asked which officer she meant, tossing in a casual follow-up about the investigation's progress. After all, Ashbourne Group had taken a reputational hit in the fallout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paige dodged again, stammering that everything was still under wraps and that her friend couldn't share details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon didn't call her out. He lowered his eyes, took a slow sip of coffee, and let the ice in his expression melt away. When he looked up again, he wore a guilt-laced smile.</span><br><span>"I owe you an apology for what happened," he said gently. "I didn't raise Caroline well enough. If I hadn't been so worried about Mom, I never would've just stood there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later that night, he made a call. "The case is going in the wrong direction," he said coldly. "From this point on, put all your attention on Paige Reed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever was on the other end gave some kind of response. Gordon didn't flinch. "Just do what I said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside a private reception room at Vireon Technologies, a young man with an artsy flair sat on a leather couch, one leg crossed, a neat braid trailing down behind his shoulder. A fresh cup of coffee sat untouched on the table in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door opened again. A sharply dressed man in a tailored suit walked in, clean lines, polished shoes, radiating power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The younger man stood immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older man offered a handshake. "Mr. Landry," he said with a polite smile, "I'm Julian Hart. A pleasure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron, who had no problem commanding a room full of loyal street-level subordinates, found himself outclassed in Julian's presence. There was something about this man, calm, composed, and terrifyingly precise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between social classes was real. And at moments like this, impossible to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged brief introductions. Julian gestured for him to sit. Aaron nodded stiffly and took his seat again. Julian sat across from him with an ease that came from knowing he didn't need to prove anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron reached for the coffee, hesitated, and then set it back down. "Let's not waste time," he said. "Why am I here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian smiled, calm and unbothered, "Before I answer, I hope you won't mind one question first&mdash;are you working for Mr. Harlow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to their intelligence, the wife of the driver's cousin had no income and poor health. Her husband meant everything to her. She was the least likely person to ever betray him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, she had stepped forward and told the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, someone had gotten to her before they had. Their later investigation confirmed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who reached her first and managed to win her over was Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron let out a dry chuckle. He'd figured as much. His shoulders relaxed, and his tone dropped into something more familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Mr. Harlow ever wanted me on his team," he said, "I'd jump at the chance. The man's a genius. But the truth is&mdash;we know each other, that's all. I'm not even close to being useful to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course he'd been following the Whitfield case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When people online started pointing fingers at Alistair, Aaron, who lived between the lines of legality, knew something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had connections in every corner of society.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't just know the driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew his people, all of them.</span></p></div>
