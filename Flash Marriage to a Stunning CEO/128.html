        <h1>Chapter 128 A Little Selfish</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline suddenly realized she had no consistent principles whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Eloise came into her life, she'd planned to live completely alone, free from any attachments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After meeting Eloise, she discovered that having someone to </span><span>care about wasn't so bad. It actually made her life richer and more meaningful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Eloise desperately wanted a complete family, so Caroline had considered finding someone for a fake marriage just to make Eloise happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, by some stroke of luck, she met</span><span> Alistair, and everything changed again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her feelings for this man were overwhelming. She wanted to be with him more than anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet just when everything fell into place, when their little family of three seemed headed for permanent happiness, Caroline'</span><span>s thoughts took another turn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved Eloise like her own daughter and felt one "little sweetheart" was enough for this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair unexpectedly mentioned Mabel's pressure about having a baby, Caroline brushed it off, but inside, doubt began </span><span>to creep in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd seen firsthand how Alistair doted on Eloise, treating her exactly like his own child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But realistically, no man wouldn't want biological children of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline felt torn, worried that if they had a baby, she might unconsciously </span><span>neglect Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Eloise looked up at her with hopeful eyes and asked if she could have a little brother or sister, Caroline suddenly realized she'd been overthinking everything. Their love for Eloise wasn't conditional on her being their only child</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Eloise's perspective, most of her friends had siblings while she was all alone. Having mom and dad around might have been enough when she was little, but as she grew up, loneliness would inevitably set in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Caroline snuggled up to </span><span>Alistair. "Honey, would you rather have a son or a daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's answer was identical to Eloise's. "As long as you're the one having our baby, I'd be happy with either a boy or a girl. They both have their advantages."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to think it through </span><span>seriously. "If it's a boy, he can look out for Eloise when he grows up. If it's a girl, she and Eloise could be inseparable sisters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words got Caroline daydreaming about Eloise holding hands with her little brother or sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe we should start se</span><span>riously thinking about this in a couple of years?" Caroline suggested after weighing everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's eyes lit up. "You really want to have a baby with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline noticed his excitement and felt a pang of guilt. "I'm sorry. I've been so focused on</span><span> Eloise's feelings that I never really considered what you wanted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gently pinched her cheek. "You're reading way too much into this! I'm just thrilled about the new baby. Eloise gets her wish for a little brother or sister, and our perfect little</span><span> family gets even bigger. What's not to be happy about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's explanation cleared Caroline's mind completely, washing away all her doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized she'd been too hung up on Eloise's adopted status, which had left her feeling stuck and unsure how</span><span> to move forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she thought about it, if Eloise were her biological daughter, she might not have all these concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wondered why Caroline had suggested waiting a couple of years before considering having children. He naturally assumed it w</span><span>as because her work kept her too busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't know was that Caroline simply wasn't ready to give up their time as just the two of them. A crying baby would definitely steal away their attention from each other. On this matter, she wanted to be a li</span><span>ttle selfish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I got some news about that director, Yves Robinson, you asked me to look into," Caroline said, after cuddling in Alistair's arms for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She already knew about everything Alistair had gone through that day. When she first he</span><span>ard about it, she was absolutely furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to go after the people who had set up Alistair, but he had stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least Caleb and his female colleague got what they deserved. Caleb might not have been completely run out of New York, but his l</span><span>ife there was effectively over for the foreseeable future. He lost his job, his relationship with Anne crashed and burned, and </span><span>after being roasted online twice in quick succession, he was basically treated like a walking plague.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline hadn't forgotten a</span><span>bout that Brady guy either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was actually the mastermind behind all this. She wouldn't let him off the hook, not a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd always said Alistair came into this world to enjoy life, not to be messed with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone stupid enough to target him would regr</span><span>et it for the rest of their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Caroline was busy handling Alistair's affairs, what she didn't realize was that Alistair wasn't exactly the pushover she thought he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bye, Dad!" Eloise called out as they reached the kindergarten entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sh</span><span>e spotted her new friends, gave Alistair a quick wave, then skipped off hand-in-hand with them, bouncing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As usual, Alistair waited until Eloise's figure completely disappeared from view before turning to leave. He'd only taken a few steps </span><span>when something caught his eye&mdash;a couple standing not far away. His footsteps suddenly froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was walking along when he caught sight of a couple standing nearby. His steps faltered instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Alistair planned to pretend he hadn't seen them, but </span><span>they were clearly there for him and wouldn't let him leave easily. He might as well face them directly. He walked over with casual confidence and greeted them politely. "Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield and Mrs. Cordelia Whitfield, it's been a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>moment Cordelia saw Alistair looking so composed and self-assured, she thought of her daughter at home, who was heartbroken and crying her eyes out. Her anger flared instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone turned instantly bitter. "Now that you've got yourself a fancy new </span><span>wife, you're suddenly too important for us. It's nearly impossible to get a moment of your time these days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clearly implying he'd married up and now thought himself too good for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled calmly, "Mrs. Cordelia Whitfield, you might wan</span><span>t to ask yourself. During my entire marriage to your daughter, what did I ever get besides an empty title? Did you ever once treat me like a Whitfield? Let's be honest here. You called me Rebecca's husband, but we both know I was just your daughter's nanny</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia's temper flared. "What kind of nanny makes two million dollars in six years? Rebecca had every right to have high expectations of you. Some people just don't know when they've got it good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got more worked up with every word until Nathaniel</span><span> tugged at her sleeve. Only then did she reluctantly close her mouth, glaring daggers at Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had turned their family upside down, and Cordelia couldn't just let it go. The fact that she hadn't slapped that handsome face of his showed remarka</span><span>ble restraint!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cordelia has a point," Nathaniel said. "Getting you to meet us is practically impossible these days. Let's find somewhere to catch up."</span></p></div>
