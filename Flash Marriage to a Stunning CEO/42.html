        <h1>Chapter 42 Tell Them Everything</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Talking to someone smart really did make life easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded. "Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but it all lined up a little too neatly. I just think... it's better to be cautious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did it register&mdash;Caroline had called him honey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel, meanwhile, slammed her palm against the armrest of her chair. "It was no accident! I can't believe I once thought that boy was ambitious and driven! Turns out he's just reckless. First, he conspires with Agnes, and then I'm nearly turned into fish food!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Eloise, who sat quietly beside her. "If I'd gone under, fine. But if Eloise had fallen in too... God forbid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's expression darkened. "I'm going to get to the bottom of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Family&mdash;her real family&mdash;was her line in the sand. If Alistair hadn't been there, if anything had happened to Mabel or Eloise...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would've killed someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let it go. You've got a full plate as it is," Mabel said, glancing between her and Alistair. "You two just focus on being happy together." She turned to Alistair. "You looked like you had something to say. Well, there are no strangers here. Speak freely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair didn't hold back. He told them everything Agnes had said&mdash;the cruel words she'd whispered to Eloise when no one was listening, words no child should ever have to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't even begin to imagine how much fear that little girl must've carried, silently, night after night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd been meaning to tell Caroline for a while now&mdash;he just hadn't found the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's entire demeanor changed. The chill in her eyes turned lethal. "She what?" she hissed. "She dared say that to my daughter? I'll make her pay for this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Easy now," Mabel said. "You're not the type to go around killing people. That's my job." She called for Alban, her tone ice-cold. "Bring Crowley back. Now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later that afternoon, despite Mabel's attempts to keep them longer, Caroline brought Alistair and Eloise home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Julian heard what happened, his jaw dropped. "You're just going to let that slide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's eyes flicked toward Alistair. "My grandma's handling it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She remembered what Mabel had whispered to her before they left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Caroline, try to be gentler, okay? Don't go scaring Alistair off. He's a sweet boy&mdash;kind, honest. If you bully him too much, he'll break."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Women were fickle&mdash;and if there was ever proof, it was Mabel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her attitude toward Alistair could turn a million different directions in a single day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But somehow, by the end of it, she was always back on his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline didn't mind at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thanks for today, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The word honey rolled off Caroline's tongue more and more naturally these days. Alistair, who used to flinch every time she said it, had grown used to it too&mdash;maybe even fond of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave her a thoughtful look. "Do you realize you have a major flaw?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline froze. "What flaw?" she asked quickly, a little too quickly. If there was something wrong with her, she wanted to fix it&mdash;immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're a total hypocrite."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She blinked. "Excuse me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're the one who told me married couples don't need to keep apologizing or thanking each other. So why are you thanking me right now? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, a double standard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline lowered her head without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's heart skipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Shit. That was too much, wasn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was he letting success get to his head? Just because he pulled off one heroic save, did that give him the right to call out his boss? And not just any boss&mdash;Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">God, I'm turning into Preston. I need to shut up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He opened his mouth to backtrack, maybe even apologize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then Caroline looked up. Her almond-shaped eyes shimmered with amusement, glassy and bright. She nodded solemnly. "You're right. I guess I was being a little hypocritical. Won't happen again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair blinked.</span><br><span>Well... that was easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least she took it well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then her expression shifted&mdash;less teasing, more serious. She hesitated before speaking again.</span><br><span>"If something like that ever happens again... would you mind telling me sooner?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She meant the thing with Eloise&mdash;those cruel words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Eloise asks you not to tell me, I'll respect that. I promise I won't take it out on you. I just... want to know what's going on. You don't have to betray her trust&mdash;I just want to make sure she's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was quiet. She didn't have to be so reasonable. She was her daughter's mother. She had every right to demand he report every detail, no questions asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And yet, she didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How lucky did I get, ending up with a boss like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can I ask you something?" he said finally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline looked up. "Sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you... have a lot of people who've tried to date you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The question caught her off guard. Her lashes fluttered as she stared at him.</span><br><span>Wait... is he jealous? Is that what this is about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She tilted her head, feigning innocence. "What made you ask that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's just... what happened today got me thinking," Alistair said. "Are there more people like that Preston guy? I mean&mdash;unstable, obsessive types. I'm just wondering if I should be... concerned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline raised a brow. "You're worried about your safety? I can get you a bodyguard or two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh. So it's not jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a flicker of disappointment in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no&mdash;Alistair wasn't jealous either. He was just genuinely concerned someone might pull another stunt like Preston's... and mess with the comfortable life he was finally starting to enjoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline didn't say anything. She simply pulled out her phone and typed a message to Julian.</span><br><span>Caroline: [Find two reliable guys. I want my husband protected.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If bodyguards were necessary, then bodyguards he'd get. End of story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rebecca, don't tell me you're ditching me for your boyfriend again! You seriously can't get away for just one afternoon? Richard's at work all day&mdash;he doesn't need you glued to his side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne's voice whined through the phone, drenched in passive-aggressive frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the mention of Richard's name, a shadow passed over Rebecca's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the mirror, her reflection looked polished, almost untouched. Her skin had regained its glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even after giving birth, she was still only twenty-four&mdash;naturally beautiful and generous when it came to skincare. Her face was smooth and radiant, collagen-rich and youthful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the room around her was drained of light. Like her, it carried a lifeless, heavy stillness. The kind that clung to grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard had stormed out after their last fight. He hadn't come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their son, Daniel, was still with her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd spent that entire night curled up on the couch, crying herself hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could still hear her father's voice echoing in her head.</span><br><span>"I won't stop you from marrying Richard, but don't think you'll get a penny from this family. You made your choice&mdash;you live with the consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her mother had wept softly beside him.</span><br><span>"We're your parents, Rebecca. We'd never hurt you. Even when we didn't approve of Alistair, we gave him a chance. But with Richard... we couldn't. Doesn't that tell you something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Daniel's words&mdash;those hurt the most.</span><br><span>"I don't want Daddy. He hit me. He hit me hard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span> </span></p></div>
