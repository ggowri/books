        <h1>Chapter 175 Pathetic Poor</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her bright, sprawling office, Caroline frowned. "They want to marry my husband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile played at her lips.</span><br><span>Let them try. They'd need to be smarter than me, more beautiful than me, more everything than me. Good luck with that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Across town in his luxurious villa, Richard lounged on his couch, scrolling through social media comments with sadistic amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The jawline, the elegance," he read aloud, his voice mocking. "Is that what you think too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His feet rested on Rebecca's shoulders as she knelt before him in a maid's uniform, the fabric deliberately arranged to expose her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept her head down, silent and compliant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard popped a plum into his mouth, continuing to scroll with his free hand. Each glowing comment about Alistair drew another harsh laugh from his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been so long, and he'd almost forgotten what started his grudge against Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some trivial slight, probably. The details had faded, but the thorn remained, festering under his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the memory of Alistair's defiant stare&mdash;that stubborn refusal to be cowed&mdash;still made his blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Richard's world, people like Alistair&mdash;born poor, raised poor&mdash;should stay beneath his heel forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet somehow, the bastard had married up. Way up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Richard discovered Alistair's wife was Caroline&mdash;CEO of Vireon Technologies, sole heiress to the Ashbourne Group, and their age&mdash;he'd spent three days in a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't accept it.</span><br><span>How dare he? How dare someone so beneath me climb so high?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, there was a way to drag him back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard thought he could manipulate the lives and deaths of others at will. He might not be the mastermind leading the public destruction of Alistair's reputation, but just knowing he played a part filled him with vicious satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat up suddenly, shoving his phone in Rebecca's face. "Look at your ex-husband. Internet famous now. Maybe he should quit business for Hollywood&mdash;might actually make some real money for once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's eyes found Alistair's face in the video. Those features she'd once known so well now seemed to belong to a stranger from another lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time will tell," came his recorded voice, calm and unshakeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what do you think?" Richard asked. "Is he bluffing, or has he completely lost it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard grabbed her hair, yanking her head back. "I asked you a question. You forget how to speak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I don't know," Rebecca whispered, fear bleeding into her vacant expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't know?" His smile turned cruel. "You were married to him for six years. You should know him better than anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd never forgotten that she'd once chosen Alistair over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard didn't particularly care about Rebecca herself, but betrayal? That was unforgivable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every humiliation he'd endured when she'd betrayed him, every moment he'd lowered himself&mdash;he was paying it all back with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered.</span><br><span>Should've used those photos from the start. Would've saved myself a lot of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Rebecca did whatever he commanded, but she'd become useless for much else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the Whitfield fortune, he'd have discarded her already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When are you signing over the rest of your family's assets?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most of the property is still in my parents' names," she answered carefully. "I need to transfer it to myself first, then to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, hurry the hell up. And don't even think about trying anything clever, or I'll make sure everyone sees exactly what kind of slut you really are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca nodded. "I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard smirked.</span><br><span>As if she could pull off anything clever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew her type&mdash;spoiled rich girl, all party and no substance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't scheme her way out of a paper bag. The threat was just habit at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Richard," she ventured hesitantly, "I'd like to visit my father at the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why bother? He's a vegetable who needs someone to wipe his ass for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca bit her lip hard, fighting back sobs. "I just... I want to see him. I'll be quick, I promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard withdrew his feet with an irritated wave. "Fine. But make it fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scrambled to her feet, mumbling thanks as she hurried to the door. Pausing, she glanced down at her degrading outfit and hurried to change in the maid's quarters on the first floor that now served as her bedroom. In decent clothes, she fled the house.</span><br><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the hospital, Nathaniel's doctor said, "I'm sorry. We've done everything possible. Your father's condition is likely permanent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He'll never wake up?" Rebecca's tears fell freely now. "Never?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor's silence was answer enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca forced a broken smile, bowed her head, and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wandered aimlessly, reluctant to face returning to Richard's prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her current abilities, she knew she couldn't get rid of Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she understood the game&mdash;he hadn't gotten what he wanted yet. As long as she had something he needed, her small rebellions would be tolerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A storefront TV caught her attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entertainment news was covering the industry drama: Stellar Films had begun production on their new project, and Feather Films had announced the cast for If There's a Next Second. Both films targeted the same release window next year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's mouth twisted bitterly.</span><br><span>Alistair and Caroline, living their happy life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in her misery, she almost missed the familiar figure in her peripheral vision. Her heart lurched as she spun away, walking quickly in the opposite direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something wrong, Vivienne? See someone you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne stared after Rebecca's retreating figure, frowning slightly. "Must've been seeing things."</span></p></div>
