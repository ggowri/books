        <h1>Chapter 120 Total Chaos</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Caleb who'd been kicked to the ground, but Rebecca was the one who screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb groaned, rolling over twice on the pavement. "Seriously?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">First a slap. Now a boot to the chest. Just my freaking luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rebecca, don't be scared. I've got you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was abruptly pulled into that man's arms&mdash;arms that were trying very hard to be comforting. "It's okay. I'm here now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But instead of feeling safe, Rebecca went rigid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked up and froze. That face... familiar enough to haunt her nightmares, a face she wanted to avoid at all costs. It was Richard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the mess of everything lately, she'd somehow forgotten he was out of jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could still hear his voice from the last time they met&mdash;twisted in fury, shouting that they were finished forever as the cops hauled him away. And now here he was, holding her close like nothing had happened, whispering reassurances?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was something about him&mdash;maybe it was the false concern, maybe just the smell of him&mdash;that made her feel dirty. Like she'd stepped in something rotten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shoved him away. "Get off me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard's expression darkened. "I sat in a cell for two weeks and didn't say a damn word. You think you're the only one who suffered? Couples fight, Rebecca. We're married&mdash;it's normal. So quit the drama."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared at him, baffled.</span><br><span>He isn't just delusional&mdash;he's delusional with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact that she'd once loved him? It made her want to smack her past self across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me be clear," she said coldly. "We're done. Whatever mess we had? It's over. You go your way, and I'll go mine. And if you so much as look at me the wrong way again, I swear I'll press charges."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People had started to gather, heads turning, phones out.</span><br><span>Richard's face flushed with embarrassment. He snapped, "Don't act all innocent. You're the one who hid the pregnancy and begged to be with me. Don't pretend you were some victim!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no shame quite like realizing the worst mistake one ever made was now shouting their secrets in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca clenched her fists. Her face flushed crimson&mdash;not from embarrassment, but from the sheer rage of knowing she'd once thought this man was worth anything at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She raised her hand to slap him again, but this time, Richard caught her wrist mid-air. His grip was iron. She tried to yank free, but it was no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He dragged her toward the curb, muttering to passersby, "She's my wife. She's just upset. We're working it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one ever did when the abuser used words like "wife" and "just upset." Rebecca felt sick, and more importantly, violated. She wanted to peel off her skin and start over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she realized she couldn't break free, she spun her head toward Caleb, who was still getting his bearings after the kick. "You want me to believe you're not full of shit?" she shouted. "Then prove it. Get him off me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb's pride was already in tatters. He didn't dare fight her, not when he still hoped to use her to get back at Alistair. Blowing up at Rebecca now would be worse than useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that guy who came in and kicked him the second he walked through the door? Yeah, that one&mdash;that he wasn't letting slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was already sizing him up from the corner of his eye, trying to figure out whether this guy was someone he could afford to mess with. Then Rebecca spoke. And just like that, he had his answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had Anne&mdash;who was head over heels for him. Now he'd just stood up for Rebecca, and she sure as hell wasn't about to take the other guy's side after that. With both women in his corner, what the hell did he have to be afraid of?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought, he charged in and landed a punch square on Richard's jaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two grown men in expensive suits started trading blows like drunk frat boys at a tailgate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Across the street, in a black sedan, Alistair let out a long, exhausted sigh and rubbed his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After insisting on taking over lunch duty for Caroline, Alistair had made a habit of showing up at her office every day with something homemade. Much to Julian's growing irritation, the two of them had settled into a cozy little lunch routine&mdash;followed by Alistair lounging in the break room reading or writing until it was time to pick up Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They'd both grown used to the rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today, after picking up Eloise from kindergarten, they were headed home when a commotion caught her attention. "Daddy!" she cried, pointing out the window. "That's the mom of the boy who tried to steal you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair glanced over. And sure enough&mdash;amid the shouting, flailing, and crowd forming around them&mdash;there was Rebecca, looking like she'd seen a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even more interesting? The two men she'd just left to brawl in the middle of the street were Richard and Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the best part? Rebecca didn't try to break it up. She didn't even try to help. She bolted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair pieced things together pretty fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd taken five million dollars from Liam&mdash;money that had apparently come from Caleb, who had gotten it from Anne. Caleb must've figured it out by now and wasn't about to let it go quietly. So what did he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tried to weaponize Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People like them thought Rebecca equaled power. With her backing him, Alistair wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But somewhere in the chaos, Richard had shown up. And clearly, he'd misunderstood what was going on. Maybe he thought Rebecca had moved on&mdash;with Caleb. And that... did not go over well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Alistair's head, it all came together like some ridiculous soap opera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only, Rebecca didn't get to walk away clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she tried to slip away, an older woman grabbed her arm. "Sweetheart, come on now," she urged. "These two men are fighting over you. At least try to calm them down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca wanted to sink into the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face turned beet red, though even she wasn't sure if it was from fury or humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hated both of them. Being associated with either man was its own kind of shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now she was stuck in the middle of this circus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd thickened. Some tried to break it up. Others filmed gleefully on their phones, delighted by the scene. A few even started narrating the fight for their Instagram stories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair? He was one of the ones filming naturally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, sirens wailed in the distance. Police arrived in record time, pulling the two men apart and dragging them into separate cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One officer turned to Rebecca. "Miss," he said, "you're coming with us too."</span><br><span>Rebecca blinked. "Wait, what? They're the ones fighting. This has nothing to do with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer didn't budge. "Witnesses say the fight started because of you. Please come with us."</span></p></div>
