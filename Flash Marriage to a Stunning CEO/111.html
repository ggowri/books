        <h1>Chapter 111 Steal Caroline's Husband</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't the first time he'd done this</span><span> </span><span>for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline fell in love with his cooking after he personally made chicken noodle soup for her and demonstrated his culinary skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was absolutely thrilled and took the opportunity to prepare her lunch for the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He prepared a hearty meal for Caroline featuring two meat dishes, two vegetarian sides, and a bowl of soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the vegetarian sides, he served up spicy buffalo cauliflower bites alongside a tangy vinegar potato salad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the meat entrees, he crafted a Cajun-spiced fish fillet, pulled pork, and mushroom soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair poured his heart into cooking for the woman he loved, finding it to be one of life's greatest pleasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He strode purposefully toward the company entrance, lunch box in hand, eyes fixed ahead, his heart filled with joy at the thought of seeing Caroline soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since becoming true husband and wife, his relationship with Caroline had transformed dramatically, leaping from their previous polite and respectful distance to passionate intimacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each morning, it took tremendous willpower to end their cuddling and actually get dressed for work. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline always insisted on embracing him affectionately before leaving, yet even after just a few hours apart, his longing for her grew wild like summer grass after heavy rain, spreading uncontrollably through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Alistair imagined what Caroline might be doing when he saw her and what expression she might wear, he unconsciously smiled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't even realize how radiant he looked, with his confident demeanor and subtle smile making him seem almost luminous. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He attracted numerous glances&mdash;some admiring, others filled with interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, as he stood waiting for the elevator, an attractive, well-dressed woman approached him boldly. "Excuse me, could I get your number?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair snapped back to reality, maintaining his warm, charming smile as he politely declined. "I'm sorry, my daughter is already five years old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman looked startled. "Oh! I'm so sorry. You look so young&mdash;I thought you were single."</span><br><span>She walked away, clearly disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair sensed someone watching and turned around to see Nathaniel staring at him with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel spotted him and walked over with a smile. "I thought that was you, but I wasn't sure. What a surprise! Do you... work here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair froze momentarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Nathaniel and Cordelia didn't like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, Alistair understood their feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Putting himself in their shoes, if his precious daughter, raised with every advantage, had been swept away by some nobody, he would have been furious too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hadn't shown him a friendly face in years, which made Nathaniel's sudden smile so jarring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair smiled back politely&mdash;courteous but distant. "It's been a while, Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield," he said, deliberately avoiding answering the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had once been the young man Nathaniel looked down upon, but now he had moved up in the world, landing on a higher branch.</span><br><span>Well. People shouldn't look down on a kid just because he's broke&mdash;tables turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But being naturally modest, Alistair had no desire to show off, nor did he want any further connection with Nathaniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel sensed his coldness, and his smile faded slightly, replaced by a hint of remorse. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alistair, I've come to understand what you went through. Cordelia and I were prejudiced against you, and we caused you considerable pain. How about this? Whenever you're free, come over for dinner. Cordelia has been talking about you lately&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alistair, over here." As the elevator doors opened, a young man in a sharp business suit with an impressive demeanor stepped out and called to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After greeting Alistair, he finally seemed to notice Nathaniel, smiling as he addressed him. "Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield? I thought you had left already."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel was momentarily caught off guard but recovered quickly. "Oh, I saw Alistair and wanted to chat with him for a moment... You two know each other?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Alistair's first visit to the company, and Caroline had specifically sent Julian down to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Julian stepped out of the elevator, he witnessed Nathaniel inviting Alistair somewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian felt something was off about the situation.</span><br><span>Alistair's ex-wife's father was actually inviting him over&mdash;was he trying to steal Caroline's man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian wasn't questioning Caroline's charm or Alistair's principles.</span><br><span>He was confident that Alistair had no desire to maintain any connection with the Whitfield family. However, he worried that Caroline would be upset if she found out about this, so he deliberately interrupted Nathaniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded politely to Nathaniel. "Yes, Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield. We have other matters to attend to, so we'll be on our way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair didn't even bother greeting Nathaniel and walked into the private elevator with Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even as the elevator doors closed, Nathaniel hadn't recovered from his shock.</span><br><span>Alistair actually knows Mr. Hart? And he even called him by his first name? The two seemed incredibly familiar with each other, almost like family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Nathaniel knew very well that Alistair was just a poor boy with no power or influence; otherwise, he wouldn't have been so affected by the two million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the six years he was with Rebecca, Alistair had been so focused on their family that he never had the chance to meet other people, let alone someone influential like Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How had Alistair become so unfamiliar, so mysterious in the short time since he'd left the Whitfield family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The private elevator that only Alistair and Julian used was surprisingly spacious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian's eyes swept over the lunchbox in Alistair's hands, prompting Alistair to immediately invite him. "I made plenty of food. Would you like to join me for lunch, Julian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian quickly waved his hand in refusal. "Thanks, but I can't. I have some business to attend to outside the office this afternoon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no desire to be an unwelcome third wheel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian knew everything about Alistair's situation, but Alistair wasn't aware of this fact. Julian asked with a knowing tone, "Do you know Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair didn't intend to hide anything. "He's my ex-wife's father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian feigned sudden understanding with an "Oh" in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vireon Technologies occupied the twenty-fourth floor of the office building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian escorted Alistair to Caroline's office, then tactfully withdrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair raised his hand and knocked gently on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Come in." Came the response from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair pushed the door open to reveal a spacious, brightly lit office with an enormous floor-to-ceiling window behind the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stepping over the threshold, Alistair glanced around.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait, where was Caroline?</span></p></div>
