        <h1>Chapter 43 Alone Now</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She remembered Richard's red-rimmed eyes, his voice sharp with emotion.</span><br><span>"I did it for you, Rebecca. Can't you see that? Are you even your parents' daughter anymore? They disown you the second you get married&mdash;what kind of people are they? How can they just cut ties like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca clutched her head, trying to block it all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Anne's voice was still there, chirping away in her ear.</span><br><span>"Seriously, stop playing the perfect housewife. Do you know what my mom said to me today? She went off about how Vivienne's so much better than me at everything. Again! So I snapped and told her, 'If Vivienne's so great, maybe stop flirting with her husband then?' Ha! Anyway, has Alistair reached out lately? I mean&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca hung up and flung the phone aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the silence didn't bring peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could hear her heartbeat, pounding too loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That faint, high-pitched buzz in her skull wouldn't go away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She slid from the chair, sinking to the cold floor, limp and drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was alone now. Truly, unmistakably alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even six years ago&mdash;when she thought things were at their worst&mdash;she hadn't felt like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, Alistair had been with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Where is Alistair now? Who's he with? Some stunning woman? Is he cooking for her? Folding her laundry? Bending over backward to make her smile?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The door opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone stepped inside, took in the disarray, and sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The kind of sigh laced with reluctant affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hands slipped under her arms, trying to lift her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca went limp, resisting in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard crouched down and simply scooped her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His strength easily overpowered her half-hearted struggle. She let it happen, eyes glazed and distant. "You never answered me," she said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard stiffened.</span><br><span>Again with this. Why can't she let it go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So he'd missed the bruising on her face. Or maybe he'd seen it and just didn't care&mdash;too busy trying to decipher Nathaniel's motives. But he had apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What more did she want?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Would she die if she didn't get an answer she liked? What good does dragging this out even do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He put on a gentler voice, coaxing her, "Okay, okay, it's all my fault, alright? Want to whip me? I'll get the belt; you can go wild&mdash;just don't stay mad, baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca looked at him, her expression blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard crouched beside her now, reaching for her hand and pressing it to his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rebecca, please don't be mad anymore, alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared at him, empty-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He climbed onto the bed beside her and pulled her close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't fight it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go pick up Danny today, yeah?" he whispered, kissing her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice came out slow, distant. "Rick... will you marry me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course," he said easily. "Why do you think I came back? To marry you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's get our license tomorrow," she murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled, indulgent and warm, "Sure. Whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As far as he was concerned, her parents were already handled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their posturing meant nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His mother was right&mdash;Cordelia and Nathaniel didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he had her completely under his thumb, the girl wouldn't hesitate to sing his praises to his parents. She would manage to win them over in no time, and that was that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like his mother had done with his father. One move, and she became the mistress of the Morgan family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Always go for the heart of the house. The rest falls in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was their only child. There was no way her parents would truly cut her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before we do," she added, "I want to sign a prenup. Like my father asked."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air went silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked up at him. Her face was unreadable. "You don't want to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard gave a thin smile. "Of course I do. I'm marrying you, not your money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said nothing for a while before saying,. "Let's not go to my parents' today," she added after a moment. "They don't want to see us right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, instead of heading to the city hall, Rebecca drove Richard to the notary office. His jaw tensed. "Rebecca. Can we not do this right now? It's our big day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to him calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd memorized every inch of his face over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, he looked like a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She yanked her hand out of his. "We agreed. Prenup first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression hardened. "Maybe you should be asking why your parents are pushing so hard for that prenup. Ever think they might have another kid on the way? A boy, maybe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard's own father had three daughters with his ex-wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All of them were now estranged&mdash;long gone after their mother died under suspicious circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His mother&mdash;the one who "won"&mdash;had done so by being young, ruthless... and giving his father a son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard had inherited that mindset. Favoring sons was practically in his DNA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's blood ran cold. "What the hell are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm just saying," he snapped. "Why else would they be so scared of you getting your share? It adds up, doesn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're disgusting. You don't want to marry me. You're just after my family's money, aren't you?" Rebecca whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six years ago, she might've fallen for his sweet talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now? She'd spent enough time being an adult&mdash;she'd picked up some instincts and earned a bit of clarity. How could she not see through something this obvious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yes, she was a romantic. But she wasn't an idiot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So now I'm the villain?" he snapped. "I'm trying to protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't ask you to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their voices rose, sharp and bitter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Harlow&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just Alistair," he said with a polite smile. "Mr. Harlow sounds too stiff."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, Alistair," Alban chuckled, "once we finish the deed transfer, Madam Ashbourne wanted to know if you'd like to join her for lunch at Ashbourne Manor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course," Alistair replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last Saturday, Mabel had gifted him a villa. She'd meant to have the paperwork done that same afternoon&mdash;until she realized it was the weekend and the office was closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, the first thing Monday morning, she sent Alban to bring him in, bright and early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they stepped out of the car together, Alban offered a knowing smile. "It's clear Madam Ashbourne has taken quite a liking to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair returned the smile. "It's an honor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The real estate office and the notary office were housed in the same building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alistair stepped out, a voice cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're unbelievable, Rebecca! If you keep acting like this, don't blame me when I never come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca came running toward the parking lot&mdash;and froze the moment she saw Alistair. And he saw her.</span></p></div>
