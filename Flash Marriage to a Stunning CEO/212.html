        <h1>Chapter 212 Fulfilled</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it turned out to be just a false alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Eloise often stayed overnight at Ashbourne Manor, she'd still see her parents every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This trip with her great-grandmother was different; it was her first real separation from her parents since she was born. Despite Alistair and Caroline promising weekly visits, the thought of not seeing them for an entire week made her heart ache, and Caroline felt the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just couldn't bear to leave them. Not seeing them for a whole week was like a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair carried her back to the bed, gently setting her down between himself and Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about we cancel the trip?" Alistair sighed inwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all that planning and anticipation, Leo would surely be disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Eloise's feelings came first, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise quickly shook her head. "No, Daddy. I already promised Great-grandma and Uncle Leo. I don't wanna go back on my word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled, teasing her gently. "Oh? Little lady, you even know about going back on your word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise broke into a grin, her tears still clinging to her long, curly eyelashes. She was still just an innocent kid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, I don't just know that. I know tons and tons of other idioms too! If you don't believe me, go ahead and quiz me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline pressed her lips together, smiling softly at the playful interaction between father and daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resting his chin on his knees, Alistair challenged her. "Alright, then. Use those fancy words of yours to describe my looks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was too easy for Eloise. She squinted joyfully, declaring, "Prince Charming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair exaggerated his surprise. "Wow, you're amazing! Now, give me another one to describe Mommy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise turned toward Caroline, planted a loud kiss on her cheek, and announced proudly, "Fairy-like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair applauded dramatically. "Brilliant! Simply brilliant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giggling, Eloise rolled into Caroline's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling contentedly, Alistair lay on his side with one hand propping his head up, quietly watching the sweet scene unfold in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wife. His daughter. A warm, peaceful family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment like this used to seem impossible even in his dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was actually the very first time the three of them had shared one bed. Ever since he moved in, becoming part of the family, Eloise had always slept alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, not exactly alone; she'd always had her little teddy bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To adults, that stuffed bear was merely a bedtime toy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Eloise, even though it couldn't speak or move, it was family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it featured prominently in many of her drawings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline hugged Eloise gently. "So, are you still going tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise pressed her cheek against her mother's face, softly caressing Caroline's cheek, eyes filled with warmth and attachment. "Yes, I have to go. I don't want to be someone who doesn't keep promises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair tested her again. "What word describes someone who breaks promises?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise laughed as she burrowed deeper into her mother's arms. "Untrustworthy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair chuckled, reaching over to ruffle her fluffy hair. "You're incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Night gradually deepened, and eventually, the family of three drifted off to sleep without even realizing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline and Eloise cuddled closely together on one side of the bed, while Alistair slept alone on the other. It was a rare night without his wife nestled in his arms. He'd thought it would feel strange, but surprisingly, he slept soundly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his arms were empty, his heart was full.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was overflowing with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slept deeply until morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair woke up and saw Caroline sleeping peacefully in his arms, he stared blankly for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was last night's scene of Eloise's tears and the three of them curled up together in bed just a dream?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline yawned softly and gently kissed his chin. "Good morning, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good morning, love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a cheerful knock at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair climbed out of bed to answer it, finding Eloise standing there, her hair adorably messy, greeting him brightly. "Good morning, Daddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now Alistair really thought he was dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only later did he find out that Eloise had slipped out at four in the morning, quietly returning to her own room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline got out of bed and crouched down to kiss Eloise's face, but Eloise immediately raised her stuffed bear. "Mommy, you have to kiss him too, or he'll get jealous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline obediently kissed the teddy bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bear wore a beautiful lace floral dress, exactly the same as one Eloise owned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Caroline guessed right, Eloise would definitely wear the matching dress today, creating a cute matching look with her teddy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the teddy close, Eloise grinned mischievously. "Mommy, now kiss Daddy too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning against the doorframe, Alistair watched them warmly, smiling with quiet amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He certainly wouldn't tell Eloise that her mommy had already kissed him earlier, just like she did every morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bent down, letting Caroline kiss him once more, and then the family of three brushed their teeth, washed their faces, and had breakfast together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to last night's comforting, Eloise was no longer upset. Instead, she was eagerly looking forward to the upcoming trip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had always been quite busy, rarely getting the chance to take Eloise anywhere. This trip was a good opportunity for her daughter to experience something new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, Caroline intended to gradually carve out more time to travel with her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, wasn't the point of making money to improve their lives?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Money was certainly no longer an issue for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breakfast, Eloise indeed put on her floral dress to match her teddy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline personally packed her luggage, while Alistair skillfully braided Eloise's hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to become a capable father, Alistair had practiced extensively. This showed clearly in the effortless way he styled Eloise's hair, skillfully crafting elegant or playful hairstyles at her request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Halfway through braiding, the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid opened the door to reveal Leo standing there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo, too excited and worried about Eloise possibly changing her mind, hadn't slept at all. He'd desperately wanted to arrive earlier, but forced himself to wait until now. Even though for Alistair's family, this was still rather early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Leo saw Alistair braiding Eloise's hair, he froze in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair chuckled at Leo's expression. "What's that look? Almost all of Eloise's hairstyles are my handiwork. Surprised?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo smiled faintly, genuinely impressed. "That's... impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once finished, Eloise hopped over to Leo. "Uncle Leo, have you had breakfast yet? We already ate, but if you haven't, I can ask our maid to make you something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo reached out instinctively to rub her hair, but seeing the freshly tied braid, he hesitated and lowered his hand again. His smile turned faintly melancholic. "Thank you, but I've already eaten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, okay!" Eloise bounced away, back to her room where Caroline was packing her suitcase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Leo's downcast mood, Alistair sat across from him, asking gently, "What's wrong? Didn't sleep well last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending time together, they were finally starting to feel a bit more like actual relatives.</span></p></div>
