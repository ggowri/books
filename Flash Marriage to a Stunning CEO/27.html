        <h1>Chapter 27 The Two Fathers</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back in their teenage years, Alistair and Richard had clashed over their incompatible worldviews, and an unexpected incident had turned them into adversaries. Later, for two million dollars, Alistair had no choice but to bow his head in front of Rebecca. Every time Richard returned to the country, Rebecca would usually shoo Alistair away like a stray dog.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even sitting alone in a park on a freezing, wind-swept night had been a rare moment of peace for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But on a few occasions, Rebecca had been unusually kind and let him stay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The three of them&mdash;Richard, Rebecca, and Daniel&mdash;would laugh and chat happily around the dining table, while Alistair silently bustled between the kitchen and dining room, ensuring their happiness ran smoothly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unlike Rebecca's domineering attitude and Daniel's loud, disrespectful demands, Richard was always polite to Alistair, even occasionally inviting him to sit and eat with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Alistair could hear the undisguised mockery and disdain in Richard's tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, meeting again, Richard still treated Alistair like the same pathetic loser he could ridicule at will. But Alistair was no longer the same man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He met Richard's gaze squarely. "If you've got time to wonder why I'm here, maybe you should focus on keeping your wife in check. Do you even know she's been harassing me repeatedly? If you knew and still let her bother me, then I can only admire your generosity. Not only were you fine with letting your woman marry me, but you even let your son call me 'Dad.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Richard's expression darken, Alistair added calmly, "If it were me, I couldn't stomach it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard snorted, "Alistair, are you delusional? Would Rebecca chase after you? I should be thanking the heavens if you aren't clinging to her. Life must be tough without the Whitfields' support, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes lingered on Alistair's custom-tailored suit, and his jaw tightened.<br>Why would Rebecca buy him such expensive clothes? He doesn't deserve them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He looks well&mdash;must've gotten a hefty settlement from Rebecca.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's mood soured further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even if you cover mud in gold, it's still mud.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You have no degree, no relevant work experience&mdash;your only skill is serving others. The money Rebecca gave you won't last forever. But I'm a man of principle. I could offer you a job, one that perfectly suits your... expertise. How about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">All he's good for is serving people. Perfect. I know a wealthy, promiscuous woman who'd love someone like him&mdash;his looks and skills would suit her just fine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As they spoke, a teacher led Daniel out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel had been let out early today, and the teacher accompanying him was Maggie, someone Alistair knew well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maggie's warm, cheerful smile froze the moment she spotted Daniel's "old" and "new" fathers standing together, the air thick with tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even the usually carefree little troublemaker Daniel stood frozen, his eyes darting between Richard and Alistair in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard gave Alistair a sidelong glance before smiling and beckoning to Daniel, "Danny, come here, son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel hesitated, glancing at Alistair, then shuffled toward Richard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Smug, Richard shot Alistair a warning look. "Stay away from my son. I won't tolerate this anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair replied coolly, "Richard, there's a fine line between confidence and delusion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard was convinced Alistair was just putting up a front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel kept sneaking glances at Alistair, his small face full of uncertainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Noticing his gaze, Alistair turned to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In a tiny voice, Daniel murmured, "Dad..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard, assuming the boy meant him, patted Daniel's head affectionately. "How about we visit Grandma later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Daniel was still staring at Alistair. "Dad... when are you coming home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My real dad is nice, but I miss my old dad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's smile vanished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though Daniel had given Alistair plenty of headaches over the years, Alistair couldn't bring himself to resent a five-year-old. That one word&mdash;"Dad"&mdash;flooded Alistair's mind with memories of Daniel as a newborn, wrinkled and tiny like a little monkey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His first word had been "Dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Danny, from now on, call me Mr. Harlow or just Alistair. Don't call me 'Dad,' okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad!" Another bright, cheerful voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair turned to see Eloise running toward him, her dress fluttering like flower petals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maggie, who had been about to leave, gaped in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At first, she'd assumed Alistair had come to see Daniel out of lingering affection, only to accidentally run into Richard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, with this little girl's appearance, she was completely lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She called him dad?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard stared, stunned, as the girl threw herself into Alistair's arms, the two sharing a tender moment.<br>So he really wasn't here for Daniel?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Since when does he have a daughter of Daniel's age?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Daniel stood frozen, as if unable to comprehend how his dad could suddenly belong to another child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, were you waiting long?" Eloise asked sweetly. "You don't have to come so early next time. I can wait for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair smiled, "It's fine. I just got here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hand in hand, they walked toward the parked car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard could only watch as Alistair helped the little girl into a Maybach by the curb, completely ignoring him and Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, Daniel wrenched free of Richard's grip and ran after them. "Dad! Dad!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's my dad! He can't be someone else's dad!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair had just settled Eloise into the car when he heard Daniel's cries. He turned to see the boy chasing after them. "Danny, I already told you. I'm not your dad anymore. Go to your real father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wasn't being sarcastic&mdash;just trying to make Daniel understand that he couldn't have two fathers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Daniel burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the past few days, he'd realized he still liked Alistair best. Alistair made him delicious food, played games with him, and told him bedtime stories. Even when he cried, Alistair never yelled&mdash;he'd comfort him gently. He wanted Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Daniel, get back here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Richard's lips twitched with fury. He strode forward, grabbing Daniel by the collar and yanking him back roughly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His sense of superiority over Alistair had just been shattered by his own son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrified, Daniel wailed, stretching his arms toward Alistair. "Dad! Don't go!"</p></div>
