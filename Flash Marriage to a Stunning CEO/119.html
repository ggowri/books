        <h1>Chapter 119 Alistair Found Out the Truth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Whitfield, over here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had just stepped into the caf&eacute; when she heard the voice. She followed it, heels clicking across the tile, and sat down across from Caleb, who had just pulled out a chair for her with rehearsed politeness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Want anything to drink?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whatever's fine," she replied curtly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't bother with pleasantries&mdash;why should she? She barely knew him, and he was dating her friend Anne. Meeting him like this, in private, already felt questionable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And if it hadn't been for what he said... Rebecca wouldn't have agreed to this "catch-up" at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb couldn't hide the flicker of surprise in his eyes when he looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd heard plenty about Rebecca&mdash;wealthy, well-connected, and apparently so desperate to get a man to marry her that she'd dropped two million dollars just to tie him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He figured she'd be average-looking at best, maybe spoiled, maybe sharp-tongued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aside from that one visit to discuss business with Liam, she'd never had any real contact with the Harlow family. No dinners, no formal introductions. Before Anne made the connection, even Caleb hadn't met her. Didn't matter. He already knew what kind of person she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair never said much about her, but Caleb had noticed the quiet exhaustion that seemed to follow him home whenever he visited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had married into money, sure. But he never looked happy. And Caleb liked it that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was reassuring, knowing that Alistair's life wasn't some fairy tale just because he'd landed a rich wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, seeing Rebecca in person for the first time, Caleb felt his assumptions cracking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was gorgeous&mdash;effortlessly so. Her features were delicate, her presence magnetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had the fresh-faced charm of a college student, balanced by a quiet sophistication well beyond her years. It was the kind of beauty that didn't need approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She made Anne look plain in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Rebecca had been born a few blocks farther west, she'd be walking red carpets by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six years married to a woman like that, and Alistair still wasn't satisfied?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her temper couldn't possibly be that bad. Just smooth her over. Spoil her a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb's eyes lingered on her face far too long, and Rebecca noticed. Disgust rose in her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without meaning to, she found herself comparing him to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But seriously? Him, compared to Alistair? Please.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't care how conventionally handsome Caleb might be&mdash;he had that greasy, predatory charm that made her skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anne really needed better taste in men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'd prefer if you got to the point," she said sharply. "You clearly didn't ask me here just for coffee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb's lips curled into a forced smile. "Right. I'll cut to it, then. Has Alistair said anything to you lately? Reached out at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca narrowed her eyes. "Enough games. Say what you came here to say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb cleared his throat, dropping the fake charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fine. Remember that two million dollars you paid my parents years ago to let Alistair drop out early and marry you? He knows. All of it. And he's already taken five million dollars from my dad as compensation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's pulse spiked, but she didn't flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam had warned her over the phone&mdash;she'd half expected something like this. For all she knew, Caleb and his father could be running a long con to extort more money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My dad had a health scare right after that," Caleb continued. "Had to be hospitalized. You were the one behind it all, and Alistair didn't even spare him. You think he's going to spare you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca stared at him, unmoved. "And?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then it hit her.</span><br><span>"Wait&mdash;did the five million dollars go to Alistair?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caleb lifted both hands in mock innocence. "He spun some story about my mom needing emergency surgery. My dad panicked and told me to find the money fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a dry laugh. "I didn't have anything&mdash;I'd just gotten back from school abroad. So Anne lent it to me. And then, just like that, my dad wired it straight to Alistair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It clicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca remembered warning Anne to be careful with her boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the time, she hadn't known Caleb was the guy Anne had been dating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, Caleb had targeted Anne from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had married into a wealthy family&mdash;that part was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And for a guy like Caleb, who'd spent years abroad building himself up, the idea of "settling" for someone below Alistair's level was unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't just ego&mdash;it was obsession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know Rebecca personally, but he'd heard her name and knew her status. Once he realized she was a Whitfield, he'd dug deeper. Found out where she liked to hang out and who she spent time with. When he spotted Anne at a bar Rebecca often visited, he saw an opportunity&mdash;and took it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Save it," Rebecca snapped, pushing back her chair. "Two million dollars, some vague 'deal,' and now you're roping Anne into it? You stole five million dollars from her, and now you want more from me? You and your father are disgusting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She grabbed her purse and stood to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People at nearby tables were starting to glance over. Caleb, flustered, jumped up to follow her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Whitfield, I'm telling the truth," he insisted. "If you don't believe me, I'll take you to the hospital myself&mdash;my dad's still there." His voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam had suffered a stroke during the whole debacle. Doctors said recovery would be long&mdash;if it happened at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celeste was threatening divorce, thanks to the five-million-dollar thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Caleb? He couldn't stop thinking about it. Alistair didn't just take their money. He'd made Caleb go crawling to Anne for money&mdash;put him in her debt, made him feel small every time they spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Alistair was walking away five million dollars richer, while their whole family fell apart. That wasn't going to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needed Rebecca on his side. She had money and influence. With her help, he could make Alistair pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't expect her to think he was scamming her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Desperate, he reached for her arm. Rebecca shrieked and slapped him across the face. "Touch me again and I swear you'll regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But deep down, it wasn't just anger. It was fear. She couldn't bring herself to accept it&mdash;that Alistair knew everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What if it is true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought back to the night before. She'd seen Alistair and spoken to him. And he hadn't brought it up. Did that mean Caleb was lying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No. The truth was worse. Alistair hadn't mentioned it... because he didn't even care enough to talk to her. He was done with her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she turned to leave, Caleb's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn't getting away that easily. Not after that slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He moved toward her. "Ms. Whitfield, I swear, if you'd just listen&mdash;" He didn't finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man walking in the opposite direction threw a brutal kick straight into Caleb's chest, sending him sprawling to the floor, gasping for air.</span></p></div>
