        <h1>Chapter 39 A Proper Introduction</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel chuckled, clearly amused, "Loosen up, dear. I promise, I don't bite."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That broke the ice. Alistair let out a shy laugh, embarrassed by how tense he was. It wasn't like he was being interrogated by a firing squad. Mabel had a kind face, and Caroline had always been protective of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> what exactly am I afraid of?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just because I'm not "ideal" on paper? That's not really a crime, is it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've heard a bit about your situation," Mabel said, her voice softening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair felt his shoulders ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He smiled sheepishly, "I'm not really someone who deserves Caroline."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel frowned, "Don't sell yourself short. That kind of talk doesn't sit well with me. Caroline chose you, and that's all I need to know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thank you," he said quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"We're family now," Mabel said kindly. "And family doesn't need to toss around words like 'thank you' all the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But then her expression shifted. Her voice, while still calm, carried more weight now. "But let's get one thing clear. Caroline is a good girl&mdash;no, she's an exceptional one. I won't lie, she's the pride of this family. Since she chose you, you'd better understand what that means. You don't get to hurt her. Not ever. If you do, I swear I won't go easy on you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair sat up straighter, his hand instinctively raising in a solemn gesture. "I promise I'll treat her well for the rest of my life. If I ever hurt her, may I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, alright," Mabel interrupted quickly, waving her hand. "That's enough. No need to tempt fate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was a certain reverence in her tone, the kind that came from someone who didn't take fate lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She sighed, muttering under her breath, "Caroline's a good kid, but she's too headstrong sometimes. Didn't even warn us before dragging you home&mdash;caught me completely unprepared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even as she grumbled, she reached into a drawer and slid a small notebook across the table toward him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"We didn't have time to plan this properly, so I couldn't prepare a proper gift. But here's something from me, if you're willing to accept it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced down. It was a property deed&mdash;for a villa in SoHo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This... this is too much. I can't possibly accept it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel's expression darkened. "What's so 'much' about it? It's just a villa. Don't tell me you're turning it down because you think my gift is cheap or rushed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, not at all," Alistair said quickly, flustered. "It's just... I didn't bring you anything in return..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel laughed, warm and wide, the lines around her eyes deepening, "Just take care of Caroline and Eloise. That's the only gift I care about. And it's a lifelong one&mdash;far more valuable than a villa."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't find the words to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">People with wealth... maybe that's why they don't cling to material things. They know what really matters. They know sincerity when they see it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, Mabel's gaze sharpened again. "Now tell me the truth. Is this marriage between you and Caroline just a transaction?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His mind went blank. Cold prickled down his spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Of course</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> she'd ask. Caroline warned me&mdash;her grandma sees through everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was ready for this. At least, he thought he was. No matter how rattled he felt inside, his face remained steady. "Please trust us. We would never treat something as serious as marriage like a joke."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And even as the words left his mouth, guilt followed right after.<br>A lie. But a kind one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel stared him down for a long moment. Then, she threw her head back and laughed, "Oh, I'm just messing with you. Look at you&mdash;completely frozen!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He tried to smile, but it was more relief than amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You'll go sign the transfer this afternoon. Alban will take you," she said, her tone leaving no room for argument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alban Fairfax was Ashbourne Manor's long-time butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this point, if Alistair insisted on declining, it wouldn't just be impolite&mdash;it would be outright ungrateful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So he accepted it with a quiet nod.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Better to go along with it now. He could always return the villa to Caroline later if it came to that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd never been the kind to covet what wasn't his. Never mind the fact that Caroline was already paying him a million dollars a month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, Alban approached from the hallway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was in his fifties, silver-haired, lean, and dressed in a sharply tailored black suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked more like a tenured professor than a servant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're just in time," Mabel told him. "Take Alistair to finalize the paperwork this afternoon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, Madam Ashbourne," Alban replied. Then, with a slight bow, he added, "Agnes has packed her things. She wishes to see you before leaving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel's smile faded. "She's leaving. No need for goodbyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But after a pause, she relented. "She's been with us long enough. Let her in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Agnes walked in with her head slightly bowed, guilt written all over her face. But the moment her eyes met Alistair's, something twisted in his gut. That familiar unease crept back in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, the voice of the Life Choice System rang out again in his mind.<br>"You sense that the Ashbourne family may be in danger. What will you do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Option one: stay out of it. You're not really part of this family. This is just a temporary arrangement, and sooner or later, you'll be gone. Their problems aren't yours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The reward for it is 100 system credits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Option two: help them. You may not be truly married to Caroline, but she's treated you with nothing but kindness. Mabel just welcomed you into the family. You may not belong here&mdash;but that doesn't mean you get to stand aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The reward for it is 200 system credits."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair didn't need to think long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He'd grown used to the system handing him dilemmas like this, always dangling a reward behind some moral test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But truthfully, even if it hadn't said a word, he already knew what he'd choose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With or without a reward, he wasn't about to stand by and do nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The problem was, all he had right now was a feeling&mdash;a strong, unshakable feeling that something was off. And every part of him was telling him Agnes was at the center of it. But without proof, what could he say?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't just march up to her, grab her by the collar, and demand to know what she was plotting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That would be insane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Last time, he'd caught her off guard&mdash;her panic had given her away. This time? She looked calm, composed, and prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he acted now, all he'd do was scare her into hiding whatever it was she was planning. And that would only make things worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment the idea hit him, Alistair pulled up the System Store on instinct. He scrolled quickly, hoping&mdash;no, needing&mdash;to find something useful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then he saw it, and his heart nearly leapt into his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Inner Voice skill acquired. Lock onto one target and hear his thoughts for one hour. It costs 200 system credits."</p></div>
