        <h1>Chapter 16 Cut Ties</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Alistair lowered his head and let out a small, self-deprecating laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, I haven't done anything wrong. Why should I ask for her forgiveness?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why did she leave you if you didn't do anything wrong? You must have messed up! Stop arguing&mdash;I'm telling you, if you don't get Ms. Whitfield to forgive you, I'll disown you as my son!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Each accusation from Liam fermented and expanded the frustration and injustice inside Alistair. When he heard the threat of being disowned, something inside him finally snapped with a deafening internal explosion that left him trembling, his hands and feet ice cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once the dust had settled, he smiled and calmly interrupted Liam. "Dad, do you really not remember why I married her in the first place? Others might not know, but surely you haven't forgotten."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Weren't you fortunate in your misfortune to become her husband? Don't be ungrateful. A wealthy family like theirs could have chosen any man as a husband," Liam responded after a long pause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair's voice quivered. "Fortunate in my misfortune? Do you think I've been living in luxury all these years? And don't forget the devastating price I paid&mdash;missing my SAT and becoming someone who can't even find a decent job!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Liam raised his voice. "What difference would taking the SAT have made? With your grades, could you have gotten into college? Without a degree, you'd still be the same useless nobody you are now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair's fingernails dug deep into his palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't believe his ears. Was this really what a father should say to his son?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Granted, Liam had barely fulfilled his parental obligations. Alistair often wondered if Liam even remembered he had a son. But Alistair had never forgotten that Liam was the only remaining family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Liam had his own life and journey, and Alistair never expected much fatherly love. Still, he genuinely wished for Liam's happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So when Liam had stood before him, desperate and in tears, explaining that without compensation money, he might go to prison and his life would be ruined, Alistair's heart had twisted in pain. He'd cried secretly all night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Rebecca had approached him, he'd dropped out of school without hesitation, despite the shock and regret of his teachers and classmates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had sacrificed his future to save Liam's life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And now, the man whose life he had saved with his future was calling him what? A useless nobody who couldn't have gotten into college even if he had taken the SAT!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair had chosen to drop out of school willingly. On the night of the SAT, as he silently wept for his lost youth, he harbored no resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Rebecca, in one of her foul moods, threw hot water in his face, he harbored no resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Rebecca half-jokingly encouraged Daniel to call him worthless for their amusement, he harbored no resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was the path he had chosen. As a man, he was willing to take responsibility for his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, listening to Liam's contemptuous assessment of him, he suddenly felt his sacrifice wasn't worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was this the father he had ruined his future to protect?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He regretted everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In his extreme anger, Alistair paradoxically became calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I never even took the SAT. How do you know I couldn't get into college? Liam, do you have any idea how I performed in school? What grades could I achieve on tests? Tell me, what do you actually know about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He continued, "And how dare you lecture me from your position as an elder? If I hadn't given you that two million dollars back then, you wouldn't be where you are today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Liam was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He hadn't expected his usually mild-mannered and agreeable son to bring up old grievances suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After his initial shock wore off, embarrassment turned to anger. "You little punk, are you trying to rebel against me?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair let out a scornful laugh.<br>Rebel?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Life Choice Triggered! Host, please make your selection!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Option one: Filial piety above all else. There are no bad parents in this world. Once you calm down, you decide to apologize to your father and follow his instructions to seek Rebecca's forgiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Option two: Not all parents love their children unconditionally! Blood relations don't guarantee pure family affection. You are thoroughly disappointed in your selfish father, who disregards your feelings, and you firmly decide to cut ties with him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair stared at two clouds drifting lazily across the brilliant blue sky outside the window and smiled&mdash;only a complete idiot would choose the first option!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though he had always craved family affection and once desperately sought Liam's attention, he now understood that some things couldn't be forced. After seeing the reality of their relationship, this so-called family bond meant nothing to him anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't care about cutting ties!" he exploded. "From this moment on, we're done! And whoever takes back these words is a real son of a bitch! You have the nerve to call me worthless? If you're so capable, why don't you pay back the two million dollars I gave you years ago!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Liam was fuming at Alistair's disrespectful way of referring to himself. "You ungrateful, disobedient brat! From now on, you're not my son!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Liam didn't say a single word about the two million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair leaned against the telephone pole to catch his breath. The falling out with Liam hadn't hit him as hard as he expected; instead, it gave him a sense of inevitable closure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So what if they'd cut ties? It honestly didn't bother him that much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To put it bluntly, even though Liam was his father, what difference had his presence made throughout Alistair's life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their rare meetings always featured Liam showering praise on his stepson from his second marriage, treating the boy like the golden child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair had always believed he wasn't good enough. He'd studied relentlessly, desperately hoping Liam would notice his achievements and offer some praise...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair let out a sneer. He'd been so naive, so foolish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At least he'd finally woken up to reality, even if it had taken this long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, after ending her call with Liam, Rebecca waited anxiously at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sure enough, before long, someone rang the doorbell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca sprang from the couch, then deliberately sat back down. She waited until she imagined the person outside was nearly at their breaking point before leisurely getting up to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Opening the door, she taunted, "I thought you were capable. Why come crawling back now?"</p></div>
