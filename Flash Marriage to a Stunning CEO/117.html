        <h1>Chapter 117 Who Was Ms. Ashbourne?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair cast a wary glance at the father and daughter sitting across from him, then leaned in to Caroline and asked quietly, "You okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline saw the concern in his eyes and gave a small shake of her head. Of course she was okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The way Alistair stood up for her cut Rebecca deeper than she expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past six years, she couldn't recall a single time she'd seen even a flicker of that kind of concern on his face&mdash;for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without even trying to hold back, she snapped, "Alistair, don't let her fake sweetness fool you. She's nasty&mdash;calculating and cruel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair nearly laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">With all her baggage, she has the nerve to call someone else toxic?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When it came to cruelty, Rebecca and Celeste could've gone head-to-head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing him smile hit Rebecca like a slap. "You don't believe me? Everything I said is true!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel hadn't expected things to spiral like this. The whole situation was slipping out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd long suspected&mdash;thanks to a few quiet nudges from Cordelia&mdash;that Rebecca had developed feelings for Alistair. He had even entertained the idea that if Alistair was willing to let the past go, he'd be open to welcoming him back into the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was becoming increasingly obvious that was a one-sided fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's emotional unraveling made something very clear. If he let this continue, it wouldn't just be her making a fool of herself&mdash;he'd be dragged down too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel gave Alistair and Caroline one last, unreadable look before grabbing Rebecca's arm and pulling her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would have someone look into that girl&mdash;find out who her family was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if she was really dating someone like Alistair, surely her parents weren't thrilled about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Nathaniel's mind, Caroline must've been cut from the same cloth as his daughter&mdash;a spoiled heiress with more access to money than maturity. A girl drawn to Alistair for his looks, someone who still needed an allowance from her parents and had no idea what she was getting into.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In families like theirs, marriage was rarely about love. It was about consolidating power, expanding wealth, and securing futures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd once planned to arrange a proper match for Rebecca when the time was right, someone well-positioned and respectable. But she'd been spoiled rotten, and now that plan had gone up in smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So now Alistair had latched onto another wealthy girl? What else could she be if not another wide-eyed romantic with no clue?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel's mind was already working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Find out who the girl's parents were. Gauge their attitude toward Alistair. If necessary, he'd be more than willing to plant a few carefully chosen rumors&mdash;stir up just enough scandal to drive them apart. Let Alistair fall flat on his face. Let him crawl back. And if Rebecca still wanted him at that point, then maybe, maybe, he'd let him back into the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And if they couldn't be split up? Well, marriages without family support never lasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A flash of malice flickered in Nathaniel's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was getting ahead of himself&mdash;just because he'd found a new backer, he thought he could walk away from the Whitfields without consequence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Still too young. Still too naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Julian emerged from the restaurant, chatting amiably with a young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel's eyes lit up.</span><br><span>That has to be Ms. Ashbourne&mdash;CEO of Vireon Technologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave Rebecca a quick look and strode forward, greeting Julian like an old friend. "Mr. Hart? What a surprise. Didn't expect to run into you here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian and the woman came to a stop. His gaze flicked briefly, politely, over Rebecca's polished appearance. "Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield," he said with a pleasant smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel caught that look and felt quietly pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca always got compliments wherever she went&mdash;grace and beauty in equal measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beaming, he made introductions. "This is my daughter, Rebecca."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd brought her to this evening's event under the pretense that she and Caroline were of similar age and might hit it off. But he had a more strategic thought in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian, as far as he knew, was still single.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure, Rebecca had been married once and had a five-year-old son. But she was still beautiful, still came from a powerful family, and still carried the Whitfield name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian was impressive&mdash;young, talented, successful&mdash;but his background was ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Surely he'd know how to seize an opportunity when it presented itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian, of course, had no idea what Nathaniel was plotting. He just noticed the way the man was looking at him&mdash;overly friendly, even... expectant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He offered Rebecca a polite smile. "Nice to meet you. I'm Julian Hart, from Vireon Technologies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was still reeling from seeing Alistair stand up for another woman. Her heart felt like it had been wrung out. She forced a smile. "Nice to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel's attention shifted to the young woman beside Julian, and his smile brightened. "And you must be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd already decided&mdash;this had to be Vireon Technologies' CEO.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian offered a smooth response. "She's a colleague of mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel's expression froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait&mdash;what? If that isn't Ms. Ashbourne... then who is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian flagged down a cab and held the door for his colleague. "Text me when you get home, okay?" he said, kindly. As the cab pulled away, he turned back and gave Nathaniel a courteous nod. "Apologies, Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield. I've got to run."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he waved&mdash;to someone behind Nathaniel and Rebecca. "Ms. Ashbourne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel jerked in surprise and spun around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few paces away stood Alistair and Caroline. And next to them... a woman, maybe around thirty, with short hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel frowned.</span><br><span>Didn't they say Ms. Ashbourne is in her mid-twenties? She definitely looks older.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, he told himself, some people just aged faster. Not everyone was like Rebecca&mdash;blessed with eternal youth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stepped forward with a wide smile. "Hello, Ms. Ashbourne. I'm Nathaniel&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Julian walked right past him and stopped in front of Alistair and Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel blinked. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The short-haired woman gave Nathaniel a strange look and muttered, "What's wrong with you?" before walking off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Julian, meanwhile, had already begun speaking with Alistair and Caroline. Nathaniel stood frozen, completely thrown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait. Then who the hell is Ms. Ashbourne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Right on cue, Julian turned toward Caroline and said casually, "Ms. Ashbourne, this is Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield from Whitfield Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And just like that, Nathaniel's mind went blank. He didn't hear a single word that followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield? Are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Nathaniel's voice cracked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His mind reeled, like he'd just been slapped awake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman he had been so eager to meet&mdash;the CEO of Vireon Technologies&mdash;was... her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It finally clicked. No wonder Alistair had shown up at Vireon's headquarters. No wonder Julian himself had come downstairs to greet him. Nathaniel had assumed Alistair was just there to drop off lunch&mdash;he'd always been the type to play the help. Never in a million years did he imagine Alistair was standing next to Vireon's CEO.</span></p></div>
