        <h1>Chapter 217 Sinner Rebecca</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca tossed the scissors aside and looked at the unconscious man on the floor with unfiltered disgust. Then she turned and walked out of the basement&mdash;above</span><span> her was the home where she had spent her entire childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The house was completely empty. She moved through it like a ghost, barely touching the floor, drifting silently into the bathroom. Without hesitation, she stripped off her bloodstained clothes and</span><span> stepped into the shower, letting the water rinse her body clean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp ache tugged at her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shut her eyes, but the image of his warm smile, his sunlit presence, was burned into her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too bad they could never be together again&mdash;no</span><span>t in this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He belonged to the light, the golden boy destined for greatness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her? She was the kind people crossed the street to avoid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even have the right to look him in the eye anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had watched the livestream. She had seen t</span><span>he three of them together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held his wife and daughter in his arms, shielding them with quiet strength. His wife confessed her love to him in front of everyone, on camera. Rebecca had seen it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked so happy, so whole, so full of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Perfect.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Just perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no place for her in that picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't explain how desperately she'd wanted, just for a second, to switch lives with the woman in that video. To take her place beside Alistair and grow old with him. To be loved by </span><span>him out in the open, like something real and good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't her fate. She could only imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she had ruined everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the water poured over her, Rebecca covered her face with her hands and wept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hated herself, and she hated the pas</span><span>t.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wrong step, and it had all unraveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when she had asked Vivienne to visit her father in the hospital, she had been ready to die. She was going to drag Richard down with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't take it anymore. Richard was a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once she </span><span>returned to the Morgan Villa, her thoughts shifted. Letting Richard die too easily would be a waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted revenge. She wanted him to suffer the way he had made her suffer. To repay him, pain for pain, wound for wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she endured. She held her bre</span><span>ath, bit down her pride, and every night she slipped something into Richard and Theresa's drinks&mdash;nothing fatal, but enough to break them down bit by bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everything went according to plan, they'd both be nothing but helpless wrecks within six months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bu</span><span>t fate intervened. She didn't need to wait for six whole months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa had been arrested. Richard had fallen into her hands ahead of schedule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew exactly what she was doing, and she didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life was ruined anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia was dead because</span><span> of her. Nathaniel was lying in a bed, barely clinging to life. She had destroyed the people who loved her and lost the one man she ever loved. She was a sinner. What right did she have to go on living?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing keeping her alive now was vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A</span><span>t some point, she finished washing up and dried herself off. Then she curled up on the couch, pulled out her phone, and started searching obsessively for anything related to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Ashbourne family had made sure that nothing remained. Everything</span><span> connected to Alistair had been wiped clean from the internet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she redirected her focus to the movie he had invested in&mdash;If There's a Next Second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Somewhere along the way, she fell asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a haze, she thought she heard someone calling her. "Rebecca, d</span><span>on't sleep out here. You'll get sick. Go to bed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Alistair's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart leapt. She opened her eyes in a flash, filled with joy, only to find herself alone. There was no one. She had been dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat up, arms wrapped around her knees, sta</span><span>ring into the emptiness. If she'd known it was only a dream, she wouldn't have opened her eyes at all. She would've stayed asleep, just to hold on a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Morning, baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Morning, hubby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline stretched lazily in bed and reached out fo</span><span>r him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled and pulled her into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She melted into him like a puddle, wrapping her arms around his neck and nuzzling into his chest, purring and murmuring with sleepy affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The no-nonsense CEO's wife was clingy as ever, and Alistair </span><span>would've given her the world if she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clung to him like an octopus, refusing to let go. He simply held her close and coaxed her with quiet, indulgent words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love you," she mumbled into his neck, her voice soft and drowsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair kissed her </span><span>forehead. "I love you too, baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carried her into the bathroom and helped her wash her face. By the time they got to brushing their teeth, she was finally awake enough to do it herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, she wasn't exactly behaving. As they brushed side by si</span><span>de, her hand started wandering across his firm waistline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair caught her hand and held it firmly. If she kept going, they wouldn't just be brushing their teeth. Instead, they'd be tearing each other's clothes off and needing another shower afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they finished brushing, Caroline closed her eyes and tilted her head up, lips puckered in silent invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair laughed and leaned in to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hooked her arms around his neck and deepened it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before things could escalate, they </span><span>pulled apart, caught their breath, and headed to breakfast. After a sweet "see you at lunch", they each went their separate ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair made his way to the set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If There's a Next Second was nearly wrapped. When he arrived, they were filming a scene betw</span><span>een Janice and the lead character.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron had stopped by to visit and watched Janice perform, a proud smile tugging at his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Alistair, he walked over and greeted him warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's the restaurant doing?" Alistair asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad</span><span>," Aaron said. "At this rate, I should break even in six months."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted casually about business for a while before Aaron rushed off around nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves waved Alistair over to listen to a new track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp, pulsing intro filled the room, followed by L</span><span>eo's unmistakable voice&mdash;low, rich, and arresting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair listened intently to the entire piece. "This is the theme song?" he asked when it ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. He said if anything feels off, he can tweak it or write a new one altogether."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think it's perfect,</span><span>" Alistair said. "The lyrics, the melody, the tone&mdash;everything lines up with the film's message."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree. That's why Leo's a genius," Yves said and then hesitated. "You heard the rumors? That he's quitting? He's canceled all his work. If he really steps a</span><span>way, it'll be a huge loss for the industry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair shook his head without commenting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Leo had gotten into the industry for fame and fortune, then he already had everything he came for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the wake of everything he'd been through, maybe walking away r</span><span>eally was his only option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, if music was truly where his heart belonged, then sooner or later, he'd find his way back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Speaking of which... I wonder if Eloise is having fun today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled out his phone and saw a string of photos and videos that </span><span>Leo had already sent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise was in a sporty T-shirt and shorts, barefoot, crouched on the beach collecting seashells. Mabel was beside her, laughing and helping her search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind them stretched the endless ocean, the horizon blending seamlessly into a cl</span><span>oudless blue sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was nowhere in the frame since he was busy taking pictures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sent him a message. [Hope you're all having a great time.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo replied almost instantly. [Don't worry. We're having a blast every day.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a simple text. Bu</span><span>t somehow, Alistair could practically hear the smug little grin behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Great. Here's hoping our little music prodigy heals up fast and comes back stronger.</span></p></div>
