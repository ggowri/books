        <h1>Chapter 129 The Other Side of Rebecca</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a restaurant near Eloise Academy, Nathaniel fill</span><span>ed Alistair in on Rebecca's situation and the company's recent troubles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were the facts, and Nathaniel knew that even if he didn't say anything, Alistair was well aware of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Morgan family was in dire straits, on the brink of bankruptcy,</span><span> and if things continued this way, the Whitfield family wouldn't be far behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this was intricately connected to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel wasn't laying it all out to show weakness or to blame him. Alistair's status had changed dramatically, and the Whit</span><span>field family barely seemed to have the right to demand answers from him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel just wanted to reason with Alistair, appeal to his better nature, and convince him to talk to his CEO wife about giving the Whitfield family a break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia was ab</span><span>solutely fuming about the whole situation. In her mind, Alistair was nothing but an ungrateful opportunist who'd forgotten where he came from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Harlow family wouldn't have survived their crisis without Rebecca's help. To him, Alistair was nothing but a </span><span>backstabbing snake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd once thought Alistair was a trustworthy man, someone she'd seriously considered as a potential husband for Rebecca.</span><br><span>Thank god he never actually joined our family. He would have destroyed us from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though </span><span>apparently, Alistair was managing to do plenty of damage from the outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia was grinding her teeth with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Rebecca told them about how Eloise Academy had rejected Daniel, they figured Alistair's current wife's daughter must attend the same</span><span> school. They'd shown up first thing in the morning to wait, and sure enough, they'd caught him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they'd said everything they came to say, Alistair calmly asked, "Mr. Nathaniel Whitfield, Mrs. Cordelia Whitfield, how well do you actually know your daug</span><span>hter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel's face went blank. "What are you talking about? She's our daughter. We know her better than anyone. Sure, she might be a bit spoiled, but even if she gave you a hard time, she also gave your family two million dollars to get you through yo</span><span>ur crisis. That doesn't justify you trying to destroy us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia wasn't nearly as restrained as Nathaniel. Her anger boiled over as she slammed her hand on the table with a crash.</span><br><span>"Alistair, I'm warning you to back off! Don't think I don't know what thi</span><span>s is about. You're just bitter because my daughter rejected you in the end. Yes, congratulations on landing yourself an even richer boss, but that doesn't give you the right to badmouth her to my face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was clearly furious, the table still vibrating fr</span><span>om her outburst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair calmly took a sip of water, his voice remaining steady and gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand it's inappropriate to criticize your daughter in front of you. I'm not trying to smear her name. I'm just stating facts.</span><br><span>"You seem to think my family</span><span> couldn't have survived without Rebecca's two million dollars. But what if I told you this whole situation was orchestrated by your daughter? What would you say then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel looked confused. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia glared at him. </span><span>"Alistair, I'm warning you. Watch what comes out of your mouth. You'd better be prepared to back up every word you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stopped wasting time and pulled out his phone. He found the recording and played it for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, Nathaniel and C</span><span>ordelia exchanged looks, both clearly shocked by what they'd just heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's bullshit!" Nathaniel couldn't stay seated anymore. He slammed his hand on the table so hard it stung. "This is impossible! Rebecca isn't that kind of person. She would never d</span><span>o something like this to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is slander! Pure defamation!" Cordelia's voice rose to a shrill pitch. "You and your dad must have cooked this up together to trick us. Alistair, I never thought you'd stoop this low!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't move from his seat</span><span>. He just smiled mockingly, "So when I asked if you really know your daughter, I was right. You don't. I probably know the other side of her better than you do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Nathaniel and Cordelia stood there uncertain and alarmed, Alistair continued, "I could h</span><span>ave gone to college and had a normal life. But your daughter, thinking only of herself, ruined me and turned me into a worthless nobody. If I just let this go, wouldn't that prove I really am worthless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All the problems your family's facing now? You broug</span><span>ht them on yourselves. You raised your daughter to be selfish, entitled, and impossible to deal with. Now you're just getting bitten by your own excessive spoiling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alistair had nothing more to say. He turned and walked away. He had other thing</span><span>s to deal with anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way he'd go easy on Rebecca. Caroline wouldn't stand for that either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel and Cordelia exchanged helpless looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia was first to speak up, her voice bitter, "It can't be true! Rebecca isn't a child who lacks </span><span>boundaries. She'd never do something as vicious as ruining someone's future. That guy's just created fake evidence to openly get revenge on our family. His father's in on it too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Nathaniel wanted to believe in Rebecca just as much as Cordelia did, t</span><span>here was a heavy feeling in his chest that he couldn't quite name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Whitfield family's future looked grim. Their projects were failing one after another. The worst part was knowing exactly who was behind it all but having absolutely no way to fight back</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel and Cordelia returned home, their minds weighed down with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca crouched in the yard watching ants, completely listless. She'd lost a noticeable amount of weight, and her usual spark was gone, replaced by an air of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cordelia's h</span><span>eart ached at the sight. She started to approach, but Nathaniel caught her eye and gave her a subtle signal. He walked over to Rebecca with his hands behind his back.</span><br><span>"Rebecca, you really messed up," he said. "Why would you make Alistair skip his </span><span>SATs to b</span><span>e with you when the test was only days away? Do you realize you might have ruined his future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's entire body visibly tensed. When she looked up, her face was completely drained of color. Her eyes widened, filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her reaction, Nath</span><span>aniel felt his heart sink. Even Cordelia gasped, covering her mouth in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't fools. Rebecca's reaction clearly confirmed everything Alistair had told them was true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alistair knows?" Rebecca's lips quivered, too shocked to even deny it. She k</span><span>new her parents had gone to see Alistair today. If he knew everything, that meant she was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when that video of two guys fighting over her went viral and she faced public mockery across social media, she hadn't felt this hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathaniel's h</span><span>and shook as he pointed at her. He'd only been bluffing to get a reaction, completely certain Rebecca would never have done something like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you do something like this?" Nathaniel stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's tears streamed down her face.</span><span> "Dad, I'm the one who wronged Alistair. I regret it so much, but I can't turn back time. He'll never forgive me. What am I supposed to do now?"</span></p></div>
