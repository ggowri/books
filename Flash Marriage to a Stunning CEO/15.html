        <h1>Chapter 15 Making Him Apologize</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca couldn't stand anyone comparing Richard to Alistair. Her brows furrowed in disgust. "Who does he think he is?" The "he" clearly referred to Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne just shrugged. Given their lifelong friendship, she'd done all she could. If Rebecca was going to be this stubborn, there was nothing more to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then again, Vivienne remembered how Alistair had pushed Rebecca away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Rebecca realized how important Alistair had become to her, he probably wouldn't take her back unless she completely transformed herself and fixed that terrible temper of hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair returned home. He actually had a place to call home now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, a famous designer arrived with several assistants to take his measurements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They kept calling him "Mr. Harlow" with service so attentive it made him uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It felt surreal to Alistair, going from a pitiful nobody to someone people treated like royalty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, a phone call yanked him back to reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His father, Liam Harlow, rarely called him, and when he did, it was never about catching up or checking in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, he never called unless he needed something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, Liam explained he'd been suffering from severe back pain that hadn't improved despite treatment. He wanted to know if Alistair could ask Rebecca about specialists who might help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment of silence, Alistair cut to the chase, saying that they were already divorced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't like he hadn't approached Rebecca with Liam's requests before. Each time, she'd torn into him mercilessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Divorced?" Liam sounded panicked. "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alistair didn't want to share the humiliations he'd endured over the years with Liam. What good would it do to air his troubles? Even if he told the whole world and won everyone's sympathy, that wouldn't change history or rewrite his past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since it couldn't, he preferred to bear it alone, process the pain quietly, and try his best to forget.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair thought he had made himself perfectly clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To his surprise, Liam had called Rebecca behind his back to verify his story!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fuming with anger, Rebecca made a decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wasn't everything Alistair had done to get her attention and win his way back to her side?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked around at her home, again in disarray because of her&mdash;perhaps it wasn't such a bad idea after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She needed someone to look after them anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for Richard, she could persuade him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as she exhaled slowly, satisfied that she'd finally found a way to punish Alistair, her phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The caller ID made Rebecca's perfectly shaped eyebrows arch slightly. She let out a contemptuous snort and deliberately waited until the caller was about to hang up before answering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ms. Whitfield, Alistair says you've divorced him. Is that true?" the caller asked in a fawning tone, carefully seeking confirmation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, Alistair realized he'd gone too far and truly angered me, huh? Was he afraid I'd never take him back, so he called reinforcements? How ridiculous. Didn't Alistair know that his sycophantic, incompetent father meant absolutely nothing to me?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca had made up her mind. Even if she graciously allowed Alistair to return, she would willingly make him kneel before her and swear to be her servant for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was what he deserved for his disobedience!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," Rebecca replied with cold elegance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That single, lightly spoken word seemed to deliver a death sentence to the man on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a long pause, Liam's deeply embarrassed voice finally came through. "I'm sorry, Ms. Whitfield. That good-for-nothing boy of mine clearly hasn't been treating you right. I apologize on his behalf. Please be generous and give him another chance, won't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca lounged lazily on the sofa, admiring her fresh manicure as she coldly remarked, "You think I'm playing house with your son?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm so sorry, Ms. Whitfield. Please don't be angry. I've already given him a good scolding," Liam pleaded. "Being accepted as your husband is a blessing from his past life, yet he doesn't appreciate it. He's completely ungrateful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca responded with a cold snort, saying nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How about this&mdash;I'll make Alistair kneel before you and beg for forgiveness. He'll stay on his knees until you forgive him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of everything Liam had said, this last suggestion pleased Rebecca the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She began to fantasize about Alistair kneeling pathetically before her, weeping and begging for her forgiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What did I tell you before? Take good care of the mother and child. They come from wealth&mdash;you could be living the good life! Don't give me that 'incompatibility' nonsense. You've been together six years; what incompatibility could there be now?<br>"You clearly haven't done enough, and she's become dissatisfied with you. Go apologize to her immediately&mdash;on your knees if necessary. Do whatever it takes to earn Ms. Whitfield's forgiveness!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair listened silently to Liam's furious commands over the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He stood tensely by the floor-to-ceiling window, his empty eyes revealing a hint of sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He realized how naive he had been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Rebecca kicked him out, he had nothing and struggled to find his footing in society, so he naturally thought of Liam first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Liam was his only relative. In times of trouble, it was natural to turn to him first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had planned to borrow some money from Liam and pay it back as soon as possible. As an adult, he was determined to support himself and not become the dependent person he despised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now it seemed that if he asked Liam for help, he would receive no comfort, and Liam might drag him to Rebecca's doorstep to kneel and apologize. But what had he done wrong?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alistair! Alistair? Are you even listening to me? Marrying Ms. Whitfield was the luckiest break you'll ever get in this lifetime, and you don't even know how to appreciate it! You're truly clueless!<br>"Don't take offense at my words&mdash;I'm saying this for your own good! Ms. Whitfield is her family's only kid. If you keep her happy, will all their family fortune eventually be yours? You could live a life of luxury! Now go apologize to her immediately!"</p></div>
