        <h1>Chapter 32 Meet Her Grandmother</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian was disappointed.<br>She shouldn't be so cruel to me. She really shouldn't.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian could tell that Caroline had not lied to him, and that she and Alistair had indeed gotten the marriage certificate just a few days after they had known each other. But Julian knew Caroline, who claimed to stay single forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After adopting Eloise, she might be shaken. To give Eloise a complete family, she might marry someone. But Julian knew that before getting the marriage certificate, Caroline would make it clear to the other party that there would be no further development except living together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But yesterday, Caroline told Julian seriously that she planned to spend her whole life with Alistair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian investigated Alistair's personal information, and his background could be described with one word&mdash;appalling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Poor family background, no education, divorced, and cheated on by his ex-wife... Of all the things he owned, only his face was decent!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian scratched his head hard but couldn't figure out why Caroline would like such a man as Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian frowned.<br>She can't just be attracted by his face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There are many men in the world who are more handsome than him. Besides, Caroline is not a superficial woman who only values appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise greeted Julian. "Julian, good morning. Have you had breakfast? If you haven't, I have some bread and milk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian's injured heart was healed in a second, and he smiled, "Yeah, I've eaten. Thank you, sweetie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian felt like he saw sunlight.<br>Eloise is so sweet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel lived in a manor in SoHo, surrounded by mountains and rivers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Every Saturday, she would wait eagerly outside the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once, there was a heavy rain. Caroline saw from a distance that Mabel was waiting outside the yard with an umbrella. She threatened Mabel that she wouldn't come to see her again. Under threat, Mabel reluctantly gave up her habit of waiting outside the gate every Saturday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But today, Mabel returned to her old ways and waited outside the door again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline glanced at Julian with a sinister look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian looked up at the sky. "What nice weather!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian swore to God that he didn't reveal the news to Mabel. Caroline had warned him in advance. It was just that when he came back yesterday, he heard that Mabel was going to arrange for Caroline to meet a young talent, so he said it was unnecessary. Mabel heard the hidden meaning and guessed something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Naturally, she asked Julian some questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On one side, it was Mabel; on the other, it was his boss. Julian almost cried in front of Mabel before Mabel allowed him to go without saying too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel had silver hair and was very well dressed. She looked calm and elegant, noble and wealthy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair couldn't help but think she looked like a queen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The moment Alistair got out of the car, Mabel's eyes were fixed on him. Then she looked at Eloise with a smile and waved to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise ran over. "Great-grandma!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel bent down and replied with a big smile, "Oh, my sweetheart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline held Alistair's hand very naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was the second time she took the initiative to make such an intimate gesture toward Alistair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Compared to the first time when he almost suffered from paralysis, Alistair was able to overcome it after being fully prepared mentally. When Caroline's soft body was close to him, he could remain calm and pretend to be composed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, he did not expect that Caroline's slender fingers would flexibly slip into his fingers and directly interlock with his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their palms pressed together, and they fully felt each other's body temperature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair felt like he was going to be paralyzed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline said softly in a voice that only the two of them could hear, "Relax, my grandma is very easy to get along with, and she won't make things difficult for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair pretended to be calm and nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He kept telling himself in his heart that it was just acting.<br>I have to make it real. Otherwise, how can others believe it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two walked toward Mabel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel's gaze slowly moved from Alistair's face to their clasped hands. A hint of surprise appeared on her face, and then her smile deepened. When she looked at Alistair again, the warmth in her eyes was almost overflowing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This shows that Caroline did not lie to him. She looked very easygoing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair breathed a sigh of relief.<br>It seems her grandma is satisfied with my appearance, but what about the other aspects? The rest parts about me are simply terrible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was vaguely worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, he felt that he was too immersed in the play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was just a bargaining chip for Caroline to avoid trouble, and they had already obtained their marriage certificate. Even if Mabel was not satisfied with him, she could do nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without waiting for Caroline to speak, Alistair took the initiative to introduce himself. "Madam Ashbourne, glad to meet you. My name is Alistair Harlow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Mabel looked calm on the surface, she was extremely excited and quickly invited them in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline glanced at Alistair and said, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She saw Alistair's ears turn red again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It feels like his ears were pinched by someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline shook her head.<br>He's so shy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair smiled calmly, but he was actually not calm at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As expected, his hand became numb, and even the whole arm seemed to have lost sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was able to remain calm and pretend to cooperate with her in acting, which was entirely due to his sense of responsibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their clasped palms were sticky, and neither of them knew whose sweat it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline had no intention of letting go of her hand, so Alistair couldn't let her go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel walked in front, holding Eloise's hand and teasing her as they walked. The interaction between them was particularly warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair and Caroline followed behind hand in hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What a heartwarming scene it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone came to the hall and took their seats. Caroline finally let go of Alistair's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While no one was paying attention, Alistair secretly put his hand on his leg and rubbed it to wipe off the sweat on his palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Inadvertently, he met Caroline's gaze. Her eyes were clear and bright, with a hint of a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He froze for a moment, feeling as if he had been caught doing something bad, but he didn't seem to have done anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, he became the focus of the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel chatted with him with a kind look and then naturally started to ask him some private questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She asked when they met, how many people there were in his family, if he was from New York, which university he graduated from, and what his hobbies were...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was a link that couldn't be avoided at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian felt as relaxed coming here as returning home. He picked up a sweet orange, peeled it, and then put the first piece into Eloise's mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was curious and wondered how Alistair would answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair knew that his personal conditions were not good enough, and his experience was far from brilliant. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was terrible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he could not make up false information to deceive Mabel, so he had to answer everything truthfully.</p></div>
