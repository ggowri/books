        <h1>Chapter 122  Another Baby?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For most people, moving meant stress, sweat, and exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But being rich? Moving was about as hard as ordering lunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Saturday, Alistair and his family settled into their new home without breaking a sweat and then headed over to Mabel's as usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second Eloise walked through the door, she ran off looking for Nugget&mdash;the name she'd proudly given the golden retriever puppy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel had let her choose the name, so naturally, Nugget it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Caroline and Eloise occupied, Mabel pulled Alistair aside for a quiet chat. "Alistair," she said, "have you and Caroline thought about having a baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair answered without thinking, "We haven't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he caught himself, chuckled, and added, "Eloise is our baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel looked at him seriously. "I know what you're both probably worried about. But I'll tell you now&mdash;I already see Eloise as family. If you two ever have a child together, I promise, that child would be treated no differently. And I know you and Caroline would be fair too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She leaned back slightly, eyes warm but direct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not about playing favorites. I'm thinking about Eloise. I just don't want her to grow up alone. Two kids is a good number. Someone to talk to, lean on. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair nodded, touched. "You're right. But this is something I need to leave up to Caroline. I'll support whatever she wants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her laugh said everything and nothing. Maybe she thought it was funny. Maybe she just liked the way he always put Caroline first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Alban walked in. He hesitated, glanced at Alistair, and then turned toward Mabel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel waved a hand. "Alistair's family. Say whatever it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alban cleared his throat. "Nathaniel Whitfield, from Whitfield Group, would like to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew Alistair had once been married into the Whitfield family. Mabel certainly did. It wasn't a secret in this house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As far as she was concerned, the Whitfields had no business showing up here. They'd never had any real ties to her side of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Which only made Nathaniel's visit that much more suspicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned to Alistair. "If you don't want me to see him, I'll have him turned away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair shrugged. "It's your call. But aren't you a little curious what he wants to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel laughed, "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't. Alright, I'll meet him. Don't worry&mdash;if he starts talking crap about you, I'm not buying a word of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair couldn't help but grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd spent six years in that marriage and had nothing to be ashamed of. If Nathaniel wanted to try throwing dirt on him now, let him try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was confident Mabel wouldn't waver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If anything, Nathaniel was probably here to ask for a truce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the Two Men Brawl in the Street Over a Woman video exploded online, Rebecca had become public enemy number one&mdash;and the Whitfield family had gotten caught in the crossfire. Their reputation had taken a serious hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But truth be told, none of the three people in that video were having a good time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Netizens were as sharp as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It didn't take long for them to ID Rebecca&mdash;and not just her. Richard and Caleb got recognized too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The internet had no shortage of bored, gleeful detectives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In no time, all three of them had their life stories ripped open and tossed out for public consumption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone dug up the fact that Rebecca had gotten pregnant her senior year of high school and hadn't been married at the time. Cue the pearl-clutching. A rich girl behaving like that?</span><br><span>Then someone else clapped back with receipts&mdash;photos of Richard overseas with various women in compromising positions. Dozens of them. Same guy, different girls, different beds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Rebecca and Richard's sordid history had been put under the microscope, the internet turned its attention to Caleb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whole "rags to riches" narrative he'd been selling? Fake. Turned out, his parents had given him a million dollars before he went abroad. Not only that&mdash;someone found out that during his time overseas, he'd been suspiciously close with a woman twice his age who'd showered him with luxury gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the hits kept coming.</span><br><span>It turned out Caleb had been loitering around bars known for attracting wealthy heiresses. That was how he'd landed one in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the internet got going, there was no stopping it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oddly enough, the one person who should've been next&mdash;Alistair&mdash;remained entirely untouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was like Caroline had thrown a bulletproof dome around him, shielding him from the frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not that Alistair doubted her ability&mdash;but just in case, he'd gone ahead and purchased a "Stay Out of It" feature from System Store. No matter how nasty the storm got online, he'd stay untouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want to drag the Ashbourne family into the circus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Richard and Caleb were probably hiding out in their homes, panicking over how a petty scuffle had turned into a nationwide scandal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Whitfields, at least, had started to put the pieces together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The incident had blown up just days after they'd publicly clashed with Caroline. And now this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel couldn't even get past the front doors at Vireon Technologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After asking around, pulling strings, and burning a few favors, he finally landed on Mabel's doorstep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His goal, obviously, was to smooth things over&mdash;get Mabel to mediate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe in his mind, Caroline was a brilliant but still-manageable businesswoman... which, frankly, was a huge miscalculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person Nathaniel really feared wasn't Caroline. It was the family behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ashbourne family wasn't just wealthy&mdash;they were the wealthiest. A global empire with reach in every industry and every continent. If the Ashbournes were old money royalty, the Whitfields barely counted as social currency. No comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The real problem? Nathaniel had no proof this whole thing was Caroline's doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the moment the video went viral, he'd had people digging to find out who was behind the push. But the mastermind had covered their tracks perfectly&mdash;nothing could be traced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, all Caroline had done was have Julian buy a trending spot. The rest? That was the internet doing what it did best&mdash;sniffing out drama, tearing it open, and passing it around like candy. By the time Nathaniel started throwing money around trying to bury the scandal, it was too late. The internet was ten steps ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Whitfield family had become the punchline of the week.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fallout hit hard. Multiple projects tanked. Their name had become toxic.</span></p></div>
