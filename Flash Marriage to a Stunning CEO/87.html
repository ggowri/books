        <h1>Chapter 87 Unreasonable</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca thought Daniel had been wronged and was insistent on settling the score with Caroline. But when she realized that her child was the one at fault, she immediately changed her attitude and started to act unreasonably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the parents were Gina's customers, it didn't mean that she should abandon her principles and tolerate them without limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, she was well aware that if she couldn't come up with a perfect solution to satisfy Caroline today, her situation would be equally dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Eloise wouldn't come to Angel's Garden to study starting tomorrow, Gina knew that Caroline could readily spend a large sum of money to buy a noble kindergarten on par with theirs. If Caroline held a grudge against her, Gina would have to leave New York City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Whitfield, the facts are clear. Daniel bears the main responsibility for this. If you're not willing to apologize today and set a good example for your child, making him think that he can get away with causing trouble as long as his family supports him, he'll be even more reckless in the future." Gina patiently persuaded. "And over time, other children will surely be afraid to play with him, which is not beneficial to his growth..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebuked by Gina in front of Caroline, Rebecca became furious and interrupted Gina, "What do you mean? Do you think my son will become a bad person if I don't apologize today? How much did this woman give you that you're trying so hard to force me to apologize to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her being unreasonable, Gina was so angry her face turned red. "Ms. Whitfield, we're talking based on facts and evidence. Please watch your words!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca stood up and pulled Daniel out. "What's so great about it? It's just a lousy kindergarten. We won't go to it anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maggie couldn't help but mutter in a low voice, "Why is Daniel's mother like this? His father is much more reasonable and easier to talk to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly stopped speaking and wished she could have slapped herself a minute ago so that she wouldn't have said something so offensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel's old father was now Eloise's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise was pretty and cute, so Maggie guessed that Alistair's current wife must be equally beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After seeing Caroline in person, Maggie realized that she had underestimated her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was just like an international supermodel, both beautiful and with a great temperament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maggie wasn't deliberately belittling Rebecca, but she thought that Rebecca really couldn't compare to Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the entrance of the kindergarten, Caroline looked at Rebecca and Daniel coldly. Daniel was a bit afraid of her and timidly hid behind Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca didn't want to lose her imposing manner, even though she had already lost completely when facing Caroline. She pretended to be scornful and said, "Do you really like a man who has been with someone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that Caroline didn't say a word, Rebecca thought she had hit her sore spot and added, "Not to mention he was my man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's face changed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca felt extremely pleased in her heart. She thought she had finally gotten back at Caroline and straightened her back. She was ready to say a few more words to sting her and then leave with Daniel in a dashing manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Caroline walked over without saying a word. Rebecca felt a sudden sense of panic in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was sophisticated and didn't take Rebecca, who had short-sighted vision and would only cry behind her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Caroline's deep gaze and unable to figure out what she was thinking, Rebecca felt a tingling on her scalp and instinctively wanted to take a step back to avoid Caroline. But thinking that this action would show her fear, Rebecca held back and said, "What are you doing&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline quickly slapped Rebecca without giving her any chance to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel, who was hiding behind his mother, shrank back.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This woman is so terrifying! She even dares to hit my mom! I just bullied her daughter. Is she going to hit me too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was shivering with fear and almost peed his pants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afraid that something unexpected would happen, Maggie, who was sent by Gina to find out what was going on, shuddered when she heard the crisp sound of the slap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's face tilted and felt burning hot. After the shock, she thought it was a great humiliation that Caroline dared to hit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does this bitch think I'm a spineless wimp who won't say a word even if she bullies me? I'm the daughter of the Whitfield Group!</span><br><span>Rebecca was so enraged that she raised her hand to fight back. She was determined to go all out against this bitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Caroline easily anticipated Rebecca's next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline seemed delicate and weak, but in fact, she often went to the gym. She had even learned martial arts for several years and was stronger than an average girl. If they really fought, Rebecca didn't stand a chance against her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca struggled to pull her hand out of Caroline's grip, but after several attempts, she failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel started crying, fearing that he would be the next one to be dealt with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline glanced at him and said, "Shut your mouth. Don't you dare cry!"</span></p></div>
