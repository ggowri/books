        <h1>Chapter 177 The Pink Rope</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stared at the pink rope lying on their bed, thoroughly confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline channeled her CEO persona, all commanding presence. "Come here, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He obeyed without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." He settled into the chair at the foot of the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline picked up the rope, twirling it between her fingers. "Pretty, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely. You and Eloise have excellent taste in colors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile turned mischievous. "Good. Now give me your hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair extended both hands, wrists together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wound the rope around them, finishing with an elaborate bow. "Like it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grin widened. "Love it. It's from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze dropped meaningfully to his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking the hint, he pressed his ankles together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She repeated the process, creating another perfect bow around his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There." She stepped back to admire her handiwork. "Now, from this moment on&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned forward and planted a kiss on her forehead, derailing her train of thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively wiped at the spot. "Stop it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're wiping me off?" He gave her his best wounded puppy look. "Am I that repulsive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be dramatic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why'd you wipe away my kiss?" He tilted his head. "Anyway, go on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this moment on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, right!" Caroline planted her hands on her hips, full boss mode activated. "From this moment on, you're staying right here in this room. You're not going anywhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not even gonna ask why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I? You're always right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His easy compliance only irritated her more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The internet's going crazy over you. Everyone's talking about how gorgeous you are, begging you to become an actor. Half of them want to marry you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair laughed, "So I'm pretty enough to make it in Hollywood? That's news to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's what you focus on?" She glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly backpedaled. "I don't want anyone else. Just you. Only you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied, she reached out to pinch his cheeks. He lifted his face eagerly, reminding her of Nugget begging for head scratches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she bent to untie the rope around his wrists, he caught her hands. "Leave the legs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm finding this whole tied-up thing kind of... exciting." His voice dropped. "Come sit on my lap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline suddenly realized she'd walked right into her own trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're so into being restrained," she said, flustered, "why'd you let me untie your hands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved his arms behind his back, his smile equal parts innocent and wicked. "How else am I supposed to hold you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Vivienne lay in bed, Rebecca's words playing on repeat in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrible possibility crept into her thoughts, making her break out in a cold sweat. She quickly sat up and grabbed her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was a VIP at her restaurant&mdash;she had his number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't too late to call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would be her first call to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had just finished untying his ankles when his phone rang. Vivienne's voice came through, tense and urgent. "Sorry to bother you so late. I saw Rebecca today. She told me you didn't hurt her parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair calmly rolled up the pink rope and set it aside. Might come in handy later. "I didn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think she knows who really did it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was stunned, and silence stretched between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, this is just my gut talking," Vivienne continued, nervous now. "I don't have proof or anything, but I felt like you should know&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled, "Thank you. I got it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline lay beside him. "She's a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, she is." He pulled the blanket up over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline studied his face. "This thing keeps snowballing. You're not worried at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I be? I didn't do anything wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, his real confidence came from the Bane Breaker sitting in his system inventory&mdash;his ace in the hole if things went south.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Caroline didn't know about his secret weapon. "Don't be naive, honey."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He traced her cheek with his finger. "Actually, my biggest asset is you. Nothing's gonna happen to me with you in my corner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had been investigating from the moment the smear campaign started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was on the right track&mdash;the Morgan family and Paige were both on her radar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But whoever was behind this was too clever, too careful. Despite her best efforts, she hadn't found any smoking guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, her resolve never wavered. "Don't worry. Nobody messes with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair rolled onto his side to face her, head propped on his hand. He watched her with quiet intensity, his soft "Yeah" conveying absolute trust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't mentioned his suspicions about Mabel's health&mdash;no point worrying her when he could handle it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd protect everyone he loved in his own way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Caroline called him just before lunch, "Honey, something urgent came up. Don't bother bringing lunch today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I already made everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save it for dinner. I really gotta go. Love you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair went to Vireon Technologies anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he waited for the elevator, the executive elevator opened and Gordon stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The system's voice echoed in Alistair's mind, "You realize Caroline's 'urgent matter' involves her father&mdash;and possibly you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you have two choices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Option One: Gordon is the richest man in America. You're nothing compared to him. Though you suspect Caroline's been put in a difficult position, you decide it's better to avoid trouble. Since Caroline doesn't want you to worry, you can pretend ignorance and let her handle it. Let her protect you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Option Two: Stop being Caroline's kept man. Face Gordon directly. Prove you're worthy of his daughter."</span></p></div>
