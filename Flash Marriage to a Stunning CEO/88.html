        <h1>Chapter 88 Rebecca Loses</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel shivered and indeed didn't dare to cry anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline looked at Rebecca domineeringly and said, "Do you know why I slapped you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was extremely annoyed and said, "Let me go, or you'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline gave a mocking snort and said haughtily, "Since I dared to slap you, do you think I'm afraid of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maggie, who was hiding in the corner and watching the conflict between them, nodded. Caroline clearly wasn't someone to be trifled with, and Rebecca had been provoking her all along. She had now run into a tough opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca glared at Caroline furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline narrowed her eyes and said, "Alistair is my husband now. He suffered a lot of grievances when he was with you. I gave you that slap on his behalf."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca roared furiously, "Who do you think you are?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline promptly gave her another slap in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Rebecca's incredulous and angry gaze, Caroline calmly shook her tingling palm and said leisurely, "This slap was originally meant for your son, but his lack of manners is also your fault. He bullied my daughter, and since I, as an adult, can't hit a child, you, as his mother, will take the punishment for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was so enraged that she shouted, "Bitch, I'll tear your face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline expressionlessly shook off her hand, and Rebecca stumbled back a step. Then she tried to pounce forward, but suddenly, two burly men emerged and stood in front of Caroline, blocking Rebecca like two walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline wasn't afraid of her. Instead, she thought it was time to put an end to this farce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, by the way," Caroline warned coolly, "Alistair is my husband. I advise you to put away any improper thoughts you have about him. If you come to harass him again, don't blame me for being rude to you." In fact, Caroline deliberately said this to anger Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was so detestable. She had bribed Alistair's family and ruined his future. After getting him, she didn't cherish him at all. She treated him like a servant and showed him no respect. Caroline had long wanted to teach her a lesson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That slap was just the beginning. Given some more time, Caroline would make the entire Whitfield family get out of New York.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca covered her face.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn it, she only slapped one side of my face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Caroline with a sense of humiliation as the latter walked dashingly towards a Rolls-Royce, and the driver opened the car door for her respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline didn't look at Rebecca anymore and got into the car. Seeing this, the two bodyguards stared at Rebecca warily and coldly before turning around and leaving. The two luxurious cars, which were worth a fortune, drove away arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that there was no more drama to watch, Maggie quickly sneaked away with a contented smile on her face as if she had thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Daniel said timidly, "Mom..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca bit her lower lip hard. Caroline had bodyguards with her when she went out, and it seemed that she was richer than her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was a civilized society now, the law that the strong were respected wouldn't change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca felt extremely humiliated. She didn't know who this damned woman was, and even if she did, it would be very difficult for her to avenge the humiliation she had suffered today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca, who had once used her wealth to casually change other people's lives, was finally taught a harsh lesson by society on how to behave. Rebecca felt resentful and unwilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of looks, Caroline was more beautiful than Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of ability, Rebecca had never earned a single penny by herself in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of family background, Caroline's family seemed to be stronger than the Whitfield family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was on the verge of a breakdown because she found that she couldn't compare with Caroline in any aspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most important thing was that the woman cared deeply about Alistair. She had Alistair firmly in her grasp, and Rebecca had even less of a chance. Compared with being slapped, losing Alistair forever was even more unacceptable to Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Caroline got home, she felt refreshed. After going out for a while, she had already pulled herself together and recovered from the girl who had been so shy after confessing her love and returned to the state of a cold and aloof CEO.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She saw that Alistair was still sitting in the same place, and his sitting posture hadn't changed at all, as if he had been frightened. Anyway, Alistair was hers for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey." Caroline smiled at Alistair as soon as she entered the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the time she was away, Alistair hadn't been in a clear state of mind. He had been muttering to himself and doubting whether he was dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing Caroline's beautiful smile, Alistair finally felt at ease. He didn't need to doubt if he was dreaming anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After confessing her feelings to Alistair, the barrier between them as a contractual couple was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair suddenly didn't know how to face Caroline, who was now his true wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from the time they had spent together these days, they had no emotional foundation. But it wasn't actually difficult for them to transform from a couple who pretended to be affectionate into a truly loving couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair walked towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline didn't know what he was going to do, so she stood still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Alistair's tall figure enveloped her. The next moment, Alistair bent down slightly and hugged her in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was shocked. She instinctively hugged Alistair's waist and buried her face in the crook of his neck. Her breath was filled with his scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sense of security, mixed with surprise, turned into overwhelming happiness that drowned her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair held the soft body in his arms tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A real sense of fulfillment instantly filled his heart, which had been hesitant and empty for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said uncertainly, "Honey?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline immediately responded, "Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had originally thought that if she called him "honey", it would be great if he simply responded to her. She never expected that Alistair would directly give her a big surprise and an extra embrace full of infinite attachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strangeness and shyness between them vanished all of a sudden with this simple but intoxicating hug. They hugged each other tightly, and neither of them had the intention of letting go first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had a complicated feeling. He couldn't figure out what Caroline saw in him, so he simply stopped thinking about it. As long as he felt happy at this moment, he didn't want to worry about the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair couldn't help asking, "Aren't you afraid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline replied, "Afraid of what?"</span></p></div>
