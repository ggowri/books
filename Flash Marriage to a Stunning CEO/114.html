        <h1>Chapter 114 I'll Do My Best</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After picking up Eloise from kindergarten, Alistair went straight to Mabel's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was attending a business cocktail party tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She typically avoided business networking events whenever possible, sending Julian as her representative when attendance was mandatory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But living in the business world meant she couldn't escape all social obligations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She only made personal appearances when Julian couldn't stand in for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her deliberately low-profile demeanor meant that most people who hadn't directly interacted with her had no idea she was the CEO of Vireon Technologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The lavish ballroom was filled with New York's elite. Designer clothes, perfectly styled hair, and champagne glasses clinked all around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering, Caroline immediately handed off her social duties to Julian. She grabbed a glass of red wine and found a quiet corner to hide in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thanks to her hands-off approach, Julian essentially represented her in public. If she hadn't needed to sign a contract tonight, she might not have attended the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Boring. It's incredibly boring.</span><br><span>She glanced disinterestedly at the men and women networking and seeking opportunities around her, while her thoughts drifted to where Alistair and Eloise were right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline glanced down at her phone to see a new message from Alistair&mdash;a video of Eloise playing with a chubby white puppy in the garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She found it strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She immediately texted back: [Where did the puppy come from?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair replied instantly: [Mabel found it abandoned on the street today while she was out.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline understood then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was fate that made Mabel break her own rule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She continued chatting with Alistair about trivial everyday things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were some simple questions like, "What did you eat? What are you doing? When are you coming home?" But Caroline never tired of asking them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel continued, "Rebecca, you're our only child. You will eventually inherit the family business. We've always considered you to be too young, wanting to give you a few more carefree years under our protection. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But thinking about it now, you're not that young anymore. It's time for you to gradually learn to take over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He changed the subject abruptly. "Rebecca, are you sure you're not still involved with that Morgan boy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca dreaded when people connected her with Richard. Currently, she felt as uncomfortable as if she had swallowed a fly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dad, I was young and naive back then... I promise you, even if every other man on earth died, I would never get back together with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel relaxed, visibly relieved. "That's pleasing to hear. Richard isn't someone you can depend on. From now on, your mother and I will look out for you. We'll find you a talented young man with excellent character."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca felt a bitterness in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't tell Nathaniel that besides Alistair, she had no interest in any other so-called talented young men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or to put it differently, Richard's insincerity had destroyed her trust in other men&mdash;all except Alistair, who had been utterly devoted to her for the past six years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they continued their conversation, they arrived at the venue for the cocktail party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca arrived with a mission, meticulously dressed and elegantly attired for the occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was strikingly beautiful, and perhaps because she'd had a child, she possessed a mature allure that women her age typically lacked, giving her an enchanting presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment she entered the venue, someone approached her with a glass of red wine, eager to strike up a conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca handled the attention with effortless grace while following Nathaniel deeper into the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel would occasionally pause to chat with acquaintances, and during these moments, Rebecca idly basked in the admiring glances thrown her way. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid her secret satisfaction, she couldn't help but wonder if Alistair would be moved if he saw how radiant she looked tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca felt deeply frustrated with herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, her heart had belonged solely to Richard, and she had saved her most beautiful and gentle side exclusively for him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Alistair, by contrast, she had been completely casual, never caring about her appearance, often wandering around in front of him disheveled and unkempt.</span><br><span>Rebecca's heart sank as she realized that Alistair had frequently seen her at her worst, with no makeup and looking terrible. Was this why he had lost all interest in her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Rebecca was lost in her troubled thoughts, her gaze inadvertently caught something that made her stiffen&mdash;what an unpleasant coincidence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She walked with a cold expression toward an inconspicuous corner of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike the other women attending in evening gowns, the woman hiding in the corner wore business attire, suggesting she had come directly from work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was chatting with someone, a slight smile on her lips, looking perfectly content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was seething with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had been harboring resentment because of this woman, dreaming of dragging her out and teaching her a harsh lesson. Yet here this woman was, living her life quite comfortably!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course&mdash;this woman had stolen Alistair from her and successfully made her life miserable. She must have been feeling incredibly smug these past few days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was livid.</span><br><span>Who was she chatting with so happily? Alistair?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her anger instantly transformed into burning jealousy as she stormed over, finally disturbing the person immersed in conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline looked up to see Rebecca standing before her, glaring with rage. Rebecca's nude-colored evening gown accentuated her curvaceous figure, and her knuckles turned white from gripping her wine glass too tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without showing any concern, Caroline sent a quick: [Talk to you later.]</span><br><span>Then she put her phone away. Her gaze moved back and forth between Rebecca's furious face and the red wine in her hand. She clicked her tongue and remarked, "Your face healed that quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca's hand trembled slightly, causing the wine in her glass to ripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's gaze settled on the wine glass in her hand, the red liquid swirling with her movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline chuckled softly, "Don't you just want to throw it in my face?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had indeed been considering exactly that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman had slapped her twice and then orchestrated her son's rejection from Eloise Academy. She and this woman would be enemies for life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca took several deep breaths to calm herself down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't the right time or place for personal vendettas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many big shots had shown up tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she actually threw the wine in this woman's face, their family would immediately become the center of controversy. The damage to their corporate image would be severe. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forget about expanding their business&mdash;they'd be lucky if Caroline didn't drag them down completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca became increasingly certain that Caroline had sinister intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was doing this deliberately, trying to provoke her into disgracing herself tonight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca gritted her teeth. "So the Eloise Academy situation was your doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline raised her glass with deliberate elegance, taking a graceful sip before frankly admitting, "Yes, that was me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca said contemptuously, "How childish! If you have the capability, why don't you ensure that every kindergarten in New York declines our application?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline smiled innocently, "I'll do my best."</span></p></div>
