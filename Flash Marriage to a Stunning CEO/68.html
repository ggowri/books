        <h1>Chapter 68 With Interest</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam couldn</span><span>'</span><span>t meet his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man across from him wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t the respectful son he remembered. This Alistair was different&mdash;sharper, colder, and unreadable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Liam knew deep down he had no one to blame but himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After years of neglect, th</span><span>is son he barely knew now felt like a stranger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Alistair had always been like a stray dog, self-sufficient and low-maintenance. Whether the dog scavenged through garbage or stole food, it didn't matter as long as Liam didn't have to put in any effo</span><span>rt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever he suddenly remembered he had a dog and needed protection, he'd just call out, and the pup would come running back, tail wagging.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this dog had been away too long. When it returned, it had transformed into a vicious beast with fangs bared, </span><span>ready to attack its master at any moment. How could Liam not be terrified?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he'd casually split the two million dollars in half, one million dollars for a new house and one million dollars for his other son's overseas education, he never imagined this </span><span>day would come!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How did Alistair find out? It must have been Ms. Whitfield who told him!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she had approached Liam earlier, they had agreed this would never reach Alistair's ears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could she break her promise like that? Does she have any idea how </span><span style="font-style: italic;">badly she screwed me over?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For all his fury, Liam could do nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power imbalance was too great. All he could do was curse under his breath to vent his frustration. He couldn't actually do anything to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just shut up!" Liam snapped at Celeste, his</span><span> frustration boiling over.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Liam had never been a good father to Alistair, he'd definitely been a model husband to Celeste and a good stepfather to Caleb.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste was so used to Liam giving in to her every whim that his sudden stern expression startle</span><span>d her into silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came here specifically to settle this," Alistair said firmly. "Years ago, you and Rebecca teamed up to cheat me out of two million dollars, money I paid for with six years of my youth and a destroyed future. You're going to pay me ba</span><span>ck, with interest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did Alistair really need the money when he made a million dollars a month? Of course not.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't the point. He wasn't about to let his deadbeat dad and scheming stepmother get away with it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Liam and Celeste should be thank</span><span>ful that Alistair was a rational person. Someone else might have completely lost it and come at them with a knife. This was his entire life they had messed with!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste, who had just calmed down, couldn't help herself. "Dream on! That two million dollars </span><span>was what you gave your dad for raising you. You're not getting a single penny back, let alone interest!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair looked at her like she'd just told the funniest joke in the world. He turned to Liam with an amused expression. "Liam, please tell me. What ex</span><span>actly did you do to raise me? Anything at all?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where would you be without your father?" Celeste shouted. "No matter how you look at it, you'll owe him for your entire life! Forget two million dollars. Your dad would spend 20</span><span>0 million dollars on you if he had to!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her outburst seemed to give Liam some courage. "That's right. Whatever you say, I'm still your father&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't deserve that title," Alistair cut in with a cold laugh. His words fell like stones. "From now on, I d</span><span>on't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, he's already dead."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam glared at him. "You&mdash;"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair continued as if he hadn't heard, "Six years of my youth spent slaving away, a life without college, a future with no prospects. I'm not asking for </span><span>much. Just give me five million dollars, and we'll call it even. Then we can go our separate ways. When you're old, find your other son to take care of you. Don't come looking for me."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you just rob a bank while you're at it?" Celeste gasped.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ca</span><span>n you really blame me?" Liam had been holding back but finally exploded. "It's because you never took school seriously! It would have been a waste of time if you had continued! You were scoring 20 or 30 on tests. If you'd gotten into college with those pat</span><span>hetic grades, it would've been a miracle!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you had half of Caleb's ability, I would've paid to send you abroad to study. But were you that kind of material? No!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Whitfield taking an interest in you was the luckiest break you could've gotten. If you'</span><span>d been smart enough to treat her right, you could've had everything! You were too stupid to keep such a good match, and I guarantee you'll regret it someday!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I got 20 or 30 percent in my exams?" Alistair noticed Liam's expression didn't seem fake, and he</span><span> shifted his mocking gaze to Celeste, who avoided eye contact.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew everything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've never once attended a parent-teacher conference or shown any interest in my education. How would you know I scored that low in my exams?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't bother wast</span><span>ing more words. He hadn't come back to discuss his test scores&mdash;he was here to make Liam suffer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam wouldn't&mdash;and Alistair didn't need him to&mdash;make things right.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Alistair knew perfectly well that Celeste had definitely fanned the flames back then, no</span><span>ne of it would have happened without Liam's permission and involvement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam was the one who had hurt him the most!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a relaxed, calm demeanor, Alistair wrote down his bank account number on a piece of paper and slid it across the table. "Transfer five </span><span>million dollars to my account within a week. If you don't pay up as agreed, don't blame me for what happens next."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dropping this ultimatum, Alistair stood up. As he passed by Liam, he held his phone up to Liam's face. His tone was light but sounded l</span><span>ike the whisper of a devil. "I don't care how you get it. Sell a kidney if you have to. Five million dollars. Not a penny less."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam's whole body trembled when he saw what was on the phone screen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having accomplished his goal, Alistair walked out confiden</span><span>tly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam collapsed back into his chair, his face ashen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alistair stepped through the doorway, he heard Celeste frantically questioning Liam, "What did that little brat say to you? Why do you look so scared? I'm telling you, he's not getting five millio</span><span>n dollars or even a single penny! If you dare give him money behind my back, I'll divorce you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam just stood there looking completely shell-shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste grew frustrated and punched his arm. "Are you even listening to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something snapped in Liam. </span><span>Maybe it was something she said, or maybe he was too stressed to handle her nagging. He suddenly lost his temper and slapped her across the face. "Shut up for a minute, you bitch!"</span></p></div>
