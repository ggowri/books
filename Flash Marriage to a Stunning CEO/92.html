        <h1>Chapter 92 Rebecca's Regret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After splitting up with Richard, Rebecca was like a woman under a spell, constantly pining for the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I wish I could turn back the clock. Before Richard decided to reconcile with me, I should've told Alistair I wanted to be with him. We could've raised Danny together and walked through life hand in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My parents had already accepted Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why was I so blind back then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was consumed by regret, but there was no undoing the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, she recalled Vivienne's advice and realized that Vivienne had seen the whole situation clearly. But what was the use now? Things had changed, and their once-close friendship had faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still, Rebecca wasn't ready to throw in the towel just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After six whole years of living under the same roof, day in and day out, Alistair should have an ounce of feeling for me, right? Even if he doesn't give a damn about me, he should at least care about Danny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I mean, he was there when Danny was born. He watched that little squalling baby grow into this lively, rambunctious kid. Whenever Danny was sick and crying his eyes out, it was Alistair who'd stay up all night, holding him close and trying to calm him down. He took better care of Danny than I did, and I'm his mother! Danny is the child he helped raise. There's no way he doesn't love Danny!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought of Daniel gave Rebecca a bit more confidence boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Okay, so that woman has a daughter around Danny's age. So what if the girl is prettier and better-behaved? How long have they even known Alistair? It's nothing compared to the father-son bond between Danny and Alistair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had conveniently forgotten how she'd once scornfully kicked Alistair out of the house, telling him not to think he was Daniel's dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now here she was, trying to use five-year-old Daniel to win back a man who'd never really been hers in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All her efforts were doomed to be in vain, like grasping at a mirage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She waited until the kindergarten gates closed, but Alistair never showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's okay. I'll come back tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I don't see him tomorrow, I'll come the day after and the day after that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Anyway, the bruises on my face won't heal in three or five days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm going to make Alistair see what a vicious woman she is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had never known that someone as impatient as herself could be so patient when it came to Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as she was about to leave empty-handed, her phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca glanced at it listlessly and saw it was an unknown number, so she hung up immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There had been a lot of nuisance calls lately, and she hadn't answered any of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was in a bad mood and didn't want to deal with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then the phone rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was already in a foul temper, and the caller's persistent nagging got on her nerves. Irritated, she angrily answered the call, ready to give the person a piece of her mind. Then a somewhat familiar voice came through. "Don't hang up! Ms. Whitfield, I need to talk to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca let out a sardonic laugh. "Liam, what are you doing hounding me? What do you want, exactly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then she had second thoughts.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">He's Alistair's father, after all. Even though they've severed ties, blood is thicker than water. There'll likely come a day when they reconcile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Since I'm planning to spend the rest of my life with Alistair, it won't do me any favors to have a bad relationship with Liam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she softened her tone a bit. "Come on, if you've got something to say, just say it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam blurted out anxiously, "Alistair knows about our deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was completely taken aback. "What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam repeated himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was like a bolt of lightning had struck Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She'd only met Liam once. What deal could they possibly be talking about? She instantly realized he was referring to what had happened six years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca tried to keep her cool, but her voice was low and seething with barely-hidden anger. "Did you tell him?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam shot back, "Do you think I'm an idiot? Why would I tell him that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca didn't buy it and was fuming. "If you didn't tell him and I didn't either, how the hell did he find out? Was it your meddling wife who spilled the beans?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Liam could tell that Rebecca was as much in the dark as he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He heaved a huge sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's good. Rebecca must be scared of this getting out, too. Her family is rich, and rich people have more ways to deal with things. As long as she can handle Alistair, I'll be able to sleep soundly, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having kept the five-million-dollar deal and saved his own skin, Liam felt confident again, and his back straightened involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That ungrateful brat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm his father, for crying out loud! In the old days, I had absolute power over my children's lives. I could sell them off if I felt like it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That heartless thing actually used an outsider to threaten me. Does he think I'm easily scared? Pfft, he's still too green!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Whitfield, hasn't Alistair given you any trouble? That ungrateful brat doesn't care about family ties. He's even willing to turn against me!" Liam complained pitifully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Rebecca shuddered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is the secret out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wasn't really worried about Alistair's revenge.</span><br><span>Will Alistair hate me to the core and never come back to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Rebecca, who, thanks to her family's wealth, had recklessly ruined a good student's future to satisfy her own selfish desires, knew how excessive she'd been back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only she, Liam, and his money-hungry wife were privy to this secret. They had all sworn to keep their lips sealed. Rebecca hadn't been worried about the secret leaking because they were all in the same predicament. If Alistair found out, it would spell trouble for every single one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, at this critical juncture, Alistair had uncovered the truth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was acutely aware of the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fear and panic washed over her, shattering her confidence. "If you didn't tell him and your wife didn't either, how the heck did he find out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Liam looked utterly dejected. "I've got no clue. At first, I thought you might have let it slip, Ms. Whitfield... Look, it's not easy to explain everything over the phone. How about we meet up and talk?"</span></p></div>
