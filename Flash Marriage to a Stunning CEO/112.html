        <h1>Chapter 112 I Won't Let You Suffer</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline's office had another door that led to a rest area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Alistair walked into the office and didn't see Caroline, he naturally assumed she was in the rest area and headed in that direction. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Carol?" he called out. But Caroline didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair remembered what Caroline had recently reminded him about and quickly corrected himself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, he had already reached the door to the rest area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hand rested on the doorknob, but he didn't immediately push it open. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"May I come in?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even as husband and wife, they needed to give each other enough respect and personal space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, a soft body pressed against his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The familiar sweet scent surrounded him as Caroline firmly wrapped her arms around his waist from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She rested her cheek against his broad back and asked, "Honey, what delicious food did you make for lunch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She missed him so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline truly felt that a day without him felt like forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the moment they had separated, she couldn't stop thinking about him every minute of every hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that he completely captivated her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair set lunch on the table as Caroline asked, "Have you eaten yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, I'm having this lunch with you today," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Caroline started moving a chair, Alistair quickly stepped in to take over. "Where did you want this chair?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline pointed to the spot next to his position. "Right here beside yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her desk was rather large, and sitting across from each other would have put too much distance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline wanted to be close to him, breathing in his scent while enjoying their delicious meal&mdash;one of life's simple pleasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing her enjoyment, Alistair tentatively suggested, "What if I bring you lunch every day from now on? I'm just sitting around at home with nothing to do anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline considered the offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even more appealing than Alistair's home-cooked meals was the prospect of seeing him every day at noon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline, normally so decisive, found herself hesitating. "Wouldn't that be too much trouble for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair nearly laughed, "Trouble for me? Apart from taking Eloise to and from school, I literally have nothing to do all day. How could that possibly be trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the novel he was currently writing, while he genuinely wanted to prove himself, the other reason was simply to find something to fill his time&mdash;nothing significant compared to Caroline's busy schedule managing several companies and handling countless daily matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Caroline clearly had different ideas from what he had anticipated. "Honey, if you choose to be with me, I will ensure that you enjoy a fulfilling life. I won't let you struggle with any daily hardships."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression was entirely serious, as if managing every aspect of Alistair's life, no matter how minor, was an inherent part of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only people who had ever cared for him so completely before were his mother and grandfather...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair turned his head, forcing back the unexpected tears that had welled up in his eyes before casually saying, "Making lunch for you isn't what I'd call a hardship. Actually, it's something I enjoy because I'm doing it for you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, think about it&mdash;I'm staying at home all day with nothing to do. How boring is that? Aren't you worried I'll go stir-crazy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline began to waver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair pressed his advantage. "Or is it that you don't actually like my cooking? Are you just saying it's good to spare my feelings, but you've been lying to me this whole time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline surrendered. "Fine, I'll leave the lunches to you from now on. But if you ever find it too much work, you can stop anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair felt he could make her meals for a lifetime without ever finding it burdensome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But all he said was a simple, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The office lounge combined elements of a study and bedroom, featuring a twin-size bed and an entire wall lined with bookshelves filled with Caroline's collection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A small table with a vase of fresh flowers sat between comfortable armchairs, creating a cozy reading nook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After resting a while following their meal, Caroline began working while Alistair stayed behind. He pulled a book from the shelf and settled into the window-side sofa. The highly technical volume proved rather dry, though Alistair had noticed Caroline reading it with enormous interest at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So he put the book down and started to type away in the break room, while Caroline handled official business in her office. They spent the afternoon together this way, with Caroline feeling like it was all a dream. T</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>here was something magical about having someone patiently keep her company while she worked. Alistair's presence made the office feel cozy, just like home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And besides her, no one else knew he was there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Julian, who came to the office twice that afternoon, didn't see Alistair and naturally assumed he had already left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It gave Caroline a secret pleasure, like she was hiding a precious treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To make sure it wasn't just her imagination that Alistair really was keeping her company in his own way, Caroline deliberately opened the door to check on him twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each time, Alistair had his back to her, and she couldn't see what he was doing. Assuming he was just scrolling through his phone to pass the time, she quietly closed the door again, not wanting to disturb him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair typed the final period, successfully completing his immersive writing session for the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stretching his arms and rotating his neck, he noticed he still had some time left, so he patiently reviewed his work&mdash;a mystery adventure script&mdash;from beginning to end. After correcting the typos, he opened his email, entered an address, and sent the script as an attachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The day before, he had accidentally discovered that an up-and-coming director was collaborating with a well-known streaming platform on a mystery screenplay competition. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The aim was to select the most popular mystery script and turn it into an excellent suspense film.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After looking through the entry requirements, Alistair found it intriguing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As luck would have it, an exciting thriller story had just popped into his head, so on impulse, he decided to write it down.</span></p></div>
