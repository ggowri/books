        <h1>Chapter 132 Planning Something Big</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stepped out of the private room. Brady was part owner of this restaurant, and whenever he did his shady </span><span>business, he'd arrange with the front desk to shut off all security cameras.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ironically, that made things much easier for Alistair to take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone came rushing toward the hotel, nearly </span><span>bumping into Alistair as they passed. The man suddenly stopped, turned around, and stared. "Alistair?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Aaron. When he confirmed it was really Alistair, the relief on his face was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair looked surprised. "Were you looking for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Be</span><span>fore Aaron could answer, Alistair raised his eyebrows. "You were worried Brady might give me trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't like owing people favors," Aaron said bluntly. He was referring to how Alistair had just helped him and his sister out of a difficult situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled, "It was nothing for me. Don't worry about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron's expression remained serious. "Maybe not for you, but it matters to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't you be with your sister right now, helping her prepare for the production?" Alistair asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron sh</span><span>ook his head. "My sister gave up that role."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, she doesn't want to owe me any favors either," Alistair mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not the reason." Aaron glanced at Alistair hesitantly. Compared to his bold confidence during their first meeting, Aaron now looked at </span><span>him with obvious respect. "Do you have a minute?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair checked the time. According to his intel, Yves was still in a meeting, so he had nothing better to do, which was why he'd gotten involved in Aaron's business in the first place, teaching Brady a </span><span>lesson along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of Brady, he was probably "having fun" in there right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair couldn't help but smirk at the thought. They were all Brady's own people, so nobody could complain about the setup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once their little party wound down, the c</span><span>ops would make their grand entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, Brady wouldn't just face career ruin and social death. He'd be looking at serious jail time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on what Alistair knew, Brady would be locked up for a very long time, which gave Alistair some satisfacti</span><span>on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could've just handed the evidence directly to the authorities and achieved the same result, but Alistair considered himself a generous guy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brady deserved to enjoy one last party&mdash;his own special creation&mdash;before his extended stay behind bars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No need</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> to thank me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, I never wanted my sister anywhere near the entertainment industry," Aaron continued.</span><br><span>"The entertainment industry is rotten. People like us with no connections or power? Once we step into that world, we always end up sacrificing somethi</span><span>ng. My sister's too naive to see it. She actually thinks I'm the one with the dirty mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron gave a self-deprecating smile. "Thankfully, at the last minute, that whole thing with Mr. Newman made her figure things out on her own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair said nothing.</span><span> He couldn't care less about Aaron's sister's dreams&mdash;or about either of them, for that matter. He'd only agreed to meet Aaron to kill some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've actually been looking for you these past few days," Aaron said suddenly, catching Alistair off guard. "Tr</span><span>ied every channel I could think of, but couldn't track you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair raised an eyebrow. "You were looking for me? Let me guess&mdash;Celeste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron nodded. "That's right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair laughed, "What's she trying to get you to do to me this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron </span><span>raised his hand to his throat and made a slicing motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair scoffed, "What did she offer you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron picked up his coffee cup. "Haven't seen any benefits yet, just her big angry face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair leaned back lazily in his chair. "So what's your plan no</span><span>w?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Aaron had just admitted to searching for him for days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Alistair knew Aaron wasn't actually trying to seek revenge for Celeste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he couldn't figure out was why Aaron would go through all this trouble to find him if he wasn't pl</span><span>anning to do Celeste's dirty work. He could just ignore her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've picked up bits and pieces about what's going on between you two," Aaron said. "Just so we're clear, I think you did nothing wrong. But Celeste? She absolutely hates your guts over that five</span><span> million dollars. She really wished you were dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair knew exactly what Aaron meant. In the end, Celeste was just an extreme narcissist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was used to taking without giving, used to squeezing him dry. When she suddenly had to cough up serious cash</span><span> that affected her precious son Caleb, she couldn't handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I honestly think if I don't give her the outcome she wants, she'll just find someone else to do her dirty work. She's not going to stop until one of you goes down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron wanted to warn Alista</span><span>ir to watch his back around Celeste, though he wasn't entirely sure why he was sticking his neck out like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair shrugged. "It doesn't matter. I wasn't planning on letting her off the hook anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe Celeste didn't know Alistair was </span><span>behind Caleb's downfall, but that wouldn't stop her from blaming him for Caleb's misfortunes. She'd hold Alistair responsible for everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron perked up at this response. He'd initially pegged Alistair as just another handsome, nerdy guy, totally diff</span><span>erent from himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after spending some time with him, Aaron realized he actually kind of liked Alistair's style.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what's your plan?" Aaron smirked. One could tell Aaron was getting a kick out of watching this mess unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron knew perfectly well </span><span>that if Alistair and Celeste went head-to-head, Celeste would definitely come out on the losing end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smartest thing she could do right now was stay far away from Alistair, but unfortunately, she was too foolish to see that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled enigmaticall</span><span>y, "Didn't you say you owed me a favor? Well, here's your chance to pay it back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron straightened up. "I'm listening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alistair asked him to go after his parents, Aaron would agree in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he couldn't commit murder or robbery. He h</span><span>ad both parents and a sister to think about, and they were all law-abiding citizens. He couldn't disappoint his family like that. But making someone's life a living hell of anxiety was child's play for Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Alistair casually said, "I nee</span><span>d you to go tell Celeste that I'll be at Imperial Tower tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron was startled. "You want her to come find you? Between us, she doesn't seem mentally stable right now. She'd tear you apart if she could."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled mysteriously, "I actually like</span><span> it if she's a bit crazy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, both Liam and Caleb had faced their own karma to different degrees. Only Celeste had escaped any real consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was planning something big for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After confirming plans with Aaron, Alistair met with Yves, w</span><span>ho was shocked by the evidence of corruption Alistair presented. Yves took it seriously, promising to clean house among his staff and prevent anyone else from stealing others' work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mission accomplished, Alistair left Stellar Films as police sirens wailed,</span><span> with several squad cars racing toward the hotel where everything had gone down.</span></p></div>
