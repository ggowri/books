        <h1>Chapter 180 Grandpa</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car slowly rolled into the driveway of Ashbourne Manor. Before anyone could help, Eloise unbuckled her seatbelt and leaped down from the child safety seat all on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a white dress sprinkled with green flowers, her ponytail tied high and her wispy bangs pinned with sparkly rhinestone clips that shimmered in the sunlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nugget wagged his tail excitedly, circling around her. Eloise handed Nugget a peanut butter dog treat she'd brought from home and gently patted his head with her chubby little fingers. Her baby face lit up with a surprisingly tender look.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No rush. I brought plenty more," she said sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel stood nearby, leaning lightly on her cane, her warm smile as kind as ever. But a closer look would reveal something buried deep in her eyes&mdash;an emotion she hadn't quite managed to hide. A hint of sorrow, and a quiet reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel was in her seventies now. She had been a schoolteacher in her younger years, raising a son and a daughter while standing shoulder to shoulder with her husband, a small business owner. Their marriage had always been strong, their life modest but comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, her son started his own business from scratch and built it into a remarkable success. As his wealth grew, so did Mabel's standing. After retiring, she spent her days tending to flowers, watching over her granddaughter, and enjoying a peaceful, fulfilling life.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to the regrets many people carried through life, Mabel's journey had been remarkably full.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one lives without a few lingering attachments.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She beamed as she waved them over. Eloise ran toward her, arms wide, shouting, "Great-Grandma!"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nugget darted along behind her, hopping playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline held onto Alistair's arm as they walked over slowly. She leaned in and whispered, "Does Grandma look a little off to you today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally makeup-free, Mabel had lightly powdered her face, curled her silver hair into soft waves, and put on a deep plum dress with a delicate pearl necklace around her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked graceful, refined, elegant&mdash;very much Mabel.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair suspected the powder wasn't for beauty's sake. It was likely an attempt to hide her pallor, to appear more energized than she felt. Unfortunately, while makeup could even out her complexion, it couldn't conceal the weariness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already reached a quiet conclusion but kept it to himself. "She just got out of the hospital not long ago. It's normal she doesn't look her best."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether she agreed or simply didn't want Mabel to overhear, it wasn't clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel welcomed them with a wide smile, clearly happy to see the couple still so inseparable after everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had barely started dinner when heavy footsteps echoed from the hallway. A man entered, casting a glance at the cheerful dining table before pressing his lips into a line, saying nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel looked surprised. "Oh, you're here already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Gordon. His expression softened slightly as he gave a low hum in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing how travel-worn he looked, Mabel asked, "Have you eaten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then go grab a bite somewhere. Don't starve yourself. We've already started," she said kindly, though her words clearly meant he wasn't welcome at the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her a helpless look and acted like he hadn't caught the hint. "You're just getting started. I'll just nibble a little something. No big deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel didn't miss a beat. "The main course isn't enough for extras. The chef prepared it for a set number of people."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbothered, Gordon pulled out a chair and sat down right next to Alistair. "I'm not that hungry. I'll just pick at whatever's on the table."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel shot back without skipping a beat, "You're welcome to the salad or some bread. But don't touch the entr&eacute;e unless you're planning to skip someone else's portion."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon shrugged, letting go of his usual pride. "Fine. I'll wait and see what's left once everyone's had their fill. Salad and scraps it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair watched silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If people knew that the almighty Gordon Ashbourne&mdash;king of the business world&mdash;was sitting here begging for leftovers from his own mother, they'd be speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel, always the composed and dignified one, and Gordon, known for being stern and no-nonsense... somehow, when the two of them were together, it all turned into a strange kind of comedy. One looked like a mischievous old troublemaker, the other like a kid trying to win his mom's approval after doing something wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were clearly just bantering, but Mabel's surprise was real, and her disapproval was subtle but unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't unhappy to see her son. She just didn't think this was the right time.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe if it were just Caroline, it'd be fine. But Alistair was here too. Perhaps Mabel worried his presence might make things uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon clearly understood what she was thinking and didn't care one bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he was already seated, Mabel couldn't exactly throw him out in front of the younger ones. The least she could do was spare him the embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A servant arrived quietly with an extra set of utensils and placed them in front of Gordon without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise sat between Mabel and Caroline, watching Gordon curiously with her big bright eyes.</span><br><span>When Gordon looked back at her, she got caught and quickly looked away. In a shy voice, she greeted him. "Grandpa."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years ago, Gordon had objected when Caroline insisted on keeping a child that wasn't biologically hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd said that, if she really wanted to raise a child, he could easily find a well-off family willing to adopt the girl and treat her like a princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what did it matter what he thought?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no real say in Caroline's choices.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely saw her, and his contact with Eloise was even more limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her now&mdash;fair-skinned, bright-eyed, sharp as a tack&mdash;it was clear Caroline had raised her well.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, that soft little "Grandpa" caught him off guard. Since sitting at the table, Eloise had been the first one to speak to him. No one had prompted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon responded with a quiet "Hey," and for the first time that day, something eased in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd only seen each other a handful of times. How had she recognized him so quickly?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No need to ask. It had to be Caroline. She must've talked about him to Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let his gaze sweep casually toward Caroline, pleased to know he still held some space in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel looked surprised too. "Eloise, how did you know he's your grandpa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise peeked at Gordon and mumbled, "I saw him on TV once. He had the same last name as me and Mommy, so I asked Daddy if he was part of our family. Daddy told me he's Mommy's dad, and I should call him Grandpa. So I remembered..."</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon stared at her, silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So I was just imagining things.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a complicated glance at Alistair but said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After lunch, Mabel sat in the living room with Eloise, listening as the little girl told stories about preschool. Gordon chimed in now and then. Caroline and Alistair sat close together nearby. The whole scene felt warm and easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They really were a family, after all. And this kind of peace was exactly what a family should feel like.</span></p></div>
