        <h1>Chapter 214 The Truth Was Finally Revealed</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first night after Eloise left, both Alistair and Caroline embarrassingly found themselves wide awake, unable to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, lying there restless just felt pointless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair </span><span>glanced at Caroline with a meaningful look. "I heard working out helps with sleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline caught on instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd been together for a while now, but she still got shy when it came to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You already... I mean... didn't we already..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had alr</span><span>eady "worked out", hadn't they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But faced with Alistair's renewed interest, what could Caroline do? She let him have his way, as always.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long round of exertion, they finally managed to fall asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Days passed steadily and uneventfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The film wa</span><span>s progressing smoothly and would be wrapping soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the case, Theresa's crimes were indisputable. Execution was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair found time to visit the psychiatric facility&mdash;to "check in" on Paige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Paige saw him, the gleam of excitemen</span><span>t on her face disappeared completely. She sneered in disgust, "Why is it you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sat down calmly, gazing at the windows reinforced with thick safety bars. He couldn't help thinking of prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being in here was worse than jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see it in her</span><span> face&mdash;hollowed out and drained. Paige was falling apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, if it weren't for that same detestable look in her eyes, Alistair wouldn't have even recognized her at first glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't been inside long, but the once-composed and elegant Profe</span><span>ssor Paige Ashbourne now looked like she'd aged twenty years. Her face was haggard, her spirit dull, and her hair had gone streaky with white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair rose to leave, Paige's eyes locked onto him. "Where do you think you're going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just got here an</span><span>d now he was leaving? What kind of game was that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair offered her a polite smile. "Didn't you say you didn't want to see me? Truth is, I don't care much to see you either. But I was curious how you were holding up in here. Now that I see you're misera</span><span>ble, I can rest easy. That's all. Bye now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!" Paige exploded. "You little punk, don't get cocky. One day I'll get out of here, and when I do, I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair arched an eyebrow, his tone infuriatingly casua</span><span>l. "You really think that day's coming? Keep dreaming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there for a moment, watching as several nurses rushed in and pinned Paige to the bed while she kept screaming. Only then did he turn and walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the hospital, Alistair didn't</span><span> go home. He headed straight for the New York branch of Ashbourne Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just anyone could walk in and request a meeting with the country's wealthiest man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he stepped through the front door, the receptionist recognized him and looked </span><span>conflicted. "I'm sorry, Mr. Harlow. Mr. Gordon Ashbourne is fully booked today. He might not have time to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't respond. He simply pulled out his phone and made a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, Gordon's assistant came down in person and res</span><span>pectfully escorted him upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after that, the receptionist received a call from Gordon's office. "If Mr. Harlow visits in the future, he doesn't need an appointment. Let him go right in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only two other people had that privilege&mdash;Mabel and Carol</span><span>ine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had never used it, though.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The receptionists exchanged wide-eyed glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did this mean Gordon had accepted Alistair?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was led straight into Gordon's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon was still in a meeting. He was busy, yes, but not so busy that he </span><span>couldn't spare a few minutes to see someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair made himself comfortable on the couch, sipping the coffee the assistant brought him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Gordon walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked genuinely surprised to see Alistair. Maybe even&mdash;though he wouldn't admit it&mdash;</span><span>quietly pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sat across from Alistair, expression mild. "What brings you here? Go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't waste time with small talk. "Mr. Gordon Ashbourne, may I ask how long you plan to keep Professor Paige Ashbourne in that psychiatric facility?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever flicker of delight Gordon had felt was gone. His expression tightened. He frowned slightly, clearly irritated by Alistair's formality.</span><br><span>Did he seriously just call me "Mr. Gordon Ashbourne"?</span><br><span>Then the words sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that supposed to mean?" h</span><span>e asked, suddenly serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave him a faint smile. His features were clean-cut and confident, the picture of a wholesome young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Gordon was a busy man, so he didn't bother being diplomatic. "I believe someone with a condition like Profe</span><span>ssor Paige Ashbourne should remain in the right place and receive proper treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon was silent for a long moment and then spoke softly, "Convince me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After committing Paige, he hadn't visited her, but he'd received reports.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they were grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As </span><span>her brother, Gordon didn't want to treat her this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But pretending nothing happened would be an insult&mdash;to himself, to his late wife, and to his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for how long she should stay, he genuinely hadn't decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair's expression turned serious.</span><span> "Do you know what she did to Caroline?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon flinched slightly and then let out a sigh. "Caroline had some unpleasant history with Paige..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped mid-sentence as a terrible thought hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had trusted Paige completely. No matter how </span><span>strained her relationship with Caroline had been, she was still her aunt. He had always believed or wanted to believe that whatever Paige did was ultimately for Caroline's benefit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after seeing how far Paige was willing to go for her own selfish intere</span><span>sts...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon didn't want to finish the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair wasn't going to stop there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched Gordon's reaction closely, a tightness building in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Gordon really had no idea what Caroline had been through that year. Brilliant in business,</span><span> no doubt. But as a father? He'd failed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, the reason Caroline had issues with Professor Paige Ashbourne was because she allowed others to ransack Caroline's room and destroy the only things her mother left her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the</span><span> version you were told was that Professor Paige Ashbourne was worried Caroline would become rebellious, so she sent her to some special institution for discipline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon nodded slowly. He looked like he wanted to cut Alistair off but realized that doing </span><span>so would be useless. Even if he refused to hear it, that wouldn't erase what Caroline had been through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair continued, cold and steady like a machine playing a horror story Gordon wished he could shut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caroline tried to run away. She failed. Afte</span><span>r that, she gave up. She became a puppet on strings, doing whatever she was told. She wasn't allowed to go outside. She couldn't even go downstairs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, his voice tightening. "She's a living, breathing human being, Mr. Gordon Ashbourne, and she </span><span>wasn't even allowed to feel the sun on her face. Tell me, how could she ever be close to someone like Professor Paige Ashbourne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone sharpened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The pain was so severe that she eventually forgot everything that happened that year. But the hatred she </span><span>felt toward Paige? She never forgot. It's carved into her bones."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The titan of industry sat there, trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the year Caroline came back cold, distant, and unwilling to even call him Dad. And all this time, he had chalked it up to Caroline being </span><span>stubborn, a failed rehabilitation effort...</span></p></div>
