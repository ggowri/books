        <h1>Chapter 205 Busy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fem</span><span>ale secretary bought a gift for Gordon that would surely please a little girl. It was a doll, exquisitely crafted from head to toe, with a delicate face, beautiful clothes, and silky-smooth hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon grabbed the gift and headed straight to </span><span>Caroline's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived downstairs, he locked eyes with Leo, who was also holding a cute, pink gift box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's eyes widened in surprise, but then he quickly greeted Gordon politely. "Uncle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon grunted in response. He was just as taken aback </span><span>to see Leo here, but he didn't mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having Leo around actually made him feel more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo glanced at the gift in Gordon's hand and then at his own. Just by the color of the boxes, it was obvious they were both for Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon furrowed his brows in</span><span> thought. "What special occasion is it today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was here to curry favor with Eloise, but what about Leo?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be Eloise's birthday?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon, who was far from being a perfect father, let alone a perfect grandpa, had no idea when Eloise's birthday was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it really was her birthday, the doll he'd brought might seem a bit too ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was too late to get something else now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gordon was quick-witted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured the doll was just a starter. If it was Eloise's birthday, he could always give her </span><span>something more substantial, like an education fund.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were plenty of ways to show his love for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was initially puzzled by Gordon's presence. Gordon, his uncle, had a strained relationship with his cousin Caroline. They hardly ever interacted, al</span><span>most like strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then it hit him&mdash;wasn't his relationship with Caroline in the same boat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, not only did Gordon show up, but he also brought a gift for Eloise. Like Gordon, Leo first thought it might be Eloise's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he remembered</span><span> that her birthday was still some time away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, it all made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was here to bond with Eloise, and Gordon was clearly here to patch things up with Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, their fates seemed strangely similar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men stared at each other </span><span>for a moment before Gordon finally broke the silence. "Where have you been lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo forced a wry smile. "Busy with work," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon gave him a serious look. Seeing that Leo didn't want to elaborate, he let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo might be a kid in his eyes</span><span>, but he was an adult, and it wasn't right for elders to meddle too much in his affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their own agendas in mind, they went upstairs together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair opened the door and stood there, stunned for a good while at the sight of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise, seeing th</span><span>e gifts they'd brought for her, looked just as confused. "Is it my birthday today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon slipped on a pair of disposable slippers and said in a soft voice, "Even if it's not your birthday, can't I give you a present today, sweetie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo chimed in, "Yeah,</span><span> Eloise. You don't have to wait for your birthday to get gifts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious what they were up to, showing up right at mealtime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The maid quickly got busy frying up a few more dishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair welcomed them in with a big smile, while Caroline remained a</span><span>loof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But neither Gordon nor Leo dared to complain. They were just glad she didn't kick them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family rarely had guests&mdash;well, these two probably couldn't even be called guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were family, but the current situation was really sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family o</span><span>f three was used to their quiet routine, and suddenly having two more people around made the place lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had a quiet day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He casually glanced at the two men sitting across from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair guessed they were as calm on the surface as he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew that beneath the calm exterior, there were undercurrents, and things were about to get turbulent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, just as they were about to start their meal, Gordon's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon frowned slightly, looking rather annoyed. Who would call at </span><span>such a warm and harmonious moment to spoil the mood?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently stroked Eloise's head and said with a warm smile, "Sweetie, eat up and grow tall, like a little sunflower reaching for the sky!" Then he made his way to the balcony to take the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he </span><span>listened to the person on the other end, his face gradually darkened. Halfway through the conversation, he interrupted the caller, saying in a hurried tone, "I've got an emergency on my hands. I've gotta go right now." With that, he rushed out of the door </span><span>in a blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Eloise opened her mouth wide as Alistair popped a delicious shrimp into it. She chewed it slowly and then said, "Poor Grandpa. He's always so swamped. Can't even sit down for a proper meal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo let out a silent sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was</span><span> glad he'd cleared his schedule for this meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been looking forward to spending some quality time with Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he'd even been daydreaming about buying an apartment in this neighborhood, maybe one just across the street from Caroline's. That w</span><span>ay, he could see Eloise every single day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the best-laid plans often went haywire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Leo's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo cast a cold glance at the caller ID and, without a moment's hesitation, hit the "end call" button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise asked him, "Uncle, why don't </span><span>you answer the phone? Is it a scammer's harassing call?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a sweet girl his daughter was, even coming up with an excuse for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo nodded and put a tender, delicious piece of meat on her plate. "Yeah, it's a harassing call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hardly had he finished spe</span><span>aking when the "harassing call" came in again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo hung up, and the caller called back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hung up, but the caller was persistent. It rang again right away. He blocked the number, thinking that would be the end of it, but then other unknown numbers started</span><span> popping up on his screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo just stared at his phone, a silent groan in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise exclaimed, "Wow, the scammer is so persistent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo stood up. "I'll go and give the scammer a piece of my mind," he said and headed to the balcony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A little later, </span><span>he came back with a similarly grim look on his face. He grabbed his coat and said in a hurry, "Sorry, I also have something urgent and have to leave right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the door, he seemed to remember something. Leo turned back, ruffled Eloise's hair, and then</span><span> scurried out under Caroline's disapproving glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise sighed like a little adult, "Alas, even Uncle is so busy. Luckily, Mom and Dad aren't that busy, or else no one would be able to have meals with me every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the cramped car, Gordon's fac</span><span>e was unusually gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An audio clip was playing slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're talking nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This denial was from Paige, with a hint of barely perceptible panic in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange man said, "Afraid to admit it? I'm really curious what Mr. Gordon </span><span>Ashbourne would think if he heard my "nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was an obvious threat in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was the sound of a chair leg scraping against the floor. Then Paige's voice came again. "Don't be impulsive. It's not what you think. There must be some misunde</span><span>rstanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Misunderstanding? I wish it were a misunderstanding! But it's my life that's been ruined, and it's me who's had my leg broken! Do you know how I've lived all these years, Professor Paige Ashbourne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon sat there, frozen in his previous pos</span><span>ition, as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to know who the speaking man was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p></div>
