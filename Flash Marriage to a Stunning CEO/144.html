        <h1>Chapter 144 The Cousin</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves pulled up Freya's picture for him. "There she is. Freya. See? I wasn't kidding. She's gorgeous, right? She's playing that autistic teenage girl you created. The studio recommended her. She's got the right look, the right vibe for the part. She read your script, said you're a flat-out genius, and she's dying to meet you. So, what do you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl in the rain moved like a dream, all fluid grace and a figure that could stop traffic, her beautiful face holding a kind of heartbreaking, irresistible vulnerability.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair dug his heels in even harder. "Sorry, Mr. Robinson, but I really have to be with my wife and kid tonight. No way I can get out of it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves looked like he'd been poleaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty-six and still flying solo, and damn proud of it, he just gaped at Alistair. "You're married?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair just grinned and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was always the same reaction when people found out he was married, which was pure shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was used to it. "Yep. Married."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got a kid, too?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yep. Daughter. She's five."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow. Never would have pegged you. You're the real MVP here, hiding in plain sight!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks. And yeah, I kinda think I am."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Don't hold back, do you? Okay, so tonight's family night, got it. What about lunch, then? Just us guys, grab a quick drink?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair looked genuinely apologetic. "Sorry, Yves, man, it's not you. But I really gotta get home and whip up some lunch for my wife!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves tried to joke. "So, what, if I ever want to actually see you, I gotta book you for breakfast now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer he got was that Alistair's mornings were also strictly wife-and-kid time...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yves was utterly defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It finally clicked. For Alistair, screenwriting was just a side hustle. His real job, his main gig, was taking care of his family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair wasn't like them, grinding themselves into dust just to put food on the table...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wait a second, why am I suddenly so envious I'm practically drooling?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I had the choice, who wouldn't want to spend more time with their family?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alistair's life right now? That's the damn dream I'm busting my ass trying to achieve.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Stellar Films, Alistair headed straight home. The housekeeper had already done all the prep work for lunch. All he had to do was hit the stove and work his magic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With time to spare, he was glued to his phone, tapping away at something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was nursing a secret, a big one, that nobody knew about.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been quietly working on something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until the moment was perfect, he had to keep it under wraps, even from his wife.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hey, it's not like I'm being shady or anything! I've got a perfectly good reason for keeping this quiet!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, delivering the lunch, Alistair was beaming. "Honey, guess what? Mr. Robinson called me a total winner in life today. Any idea why?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a wild guess."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because he saw what a genius you are and knows you're about to conquer the world?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, he did say my imagination was off the charts and that my stuff was super tight, exciting, and totally gripping. But no, that's not it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what? I'm stumped..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because he found out today that I have a wife and a kid, ha! And you know what? I think he's dead right. I totally am a winner."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian tiptoed into the office, silently placed a file on the desk, then started to tiptoe back out, fully intending to ease the CEO's office door shut behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Stuffed. I'm absolutely stuffed to the gills with their goddamn PDA again!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If this file wasn't priority one, there's no way in hell I'd be barging in at lunchtime when the big boss is trying to unwind and play kissy-face with her husband!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Alistair suddenly turned to Caroline. "Honey, do you know who Freya is?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's hand, already hovering over the doorknob, froze mid-air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair caught his reaction and grinned. "Julian, looks like you know Freya too, huh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously, am I the only person on the planet who doesn't know this Freya chick?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not that I actually give a damn about her, one way or another.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian chose his words carefully. "I know of her, let's say. But I wouldn't say I know her."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair raised an eyebrow. "Her fan, are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked genuinely hurt. "Alistair, do you really see me as that shallow? In my book, Ms. Ashbourne is the only star truly worthy of anyone's admiration. Those types who just chase clout with cheap stunts and try to go viral? They're not real idols! Please!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His little speech managed to brown-nose Caroline, play up his own sophisticated taste, and throw some serious shade at the so-called starlet, all in one smooth move.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline frowned thoughtfully, "Freya... Why does that name sound so familiar?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze drifted to Julian. "Oh, that's right! You've mentioned her to me before. More than once, if I remember correctly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian suddenly looked like he wanted the floor to swallow him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, ever the diplomat, tried to bail him out. "Julian, come on. First off, Freya's a good-looking woman, and there's nothing wrong with appreciating beauty. It doesn't make you shallow. Mr. Robinson actually invited me to this dinner thing tonight, and Freya's going to be there, since she's in the movie. I passed, but if you're interested, I could..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no, it's cool! I appreciate it, man, but I'm honestly not interested in that woman," Julian said, waving his hands frantically, a weird mix of laughter and exasperation on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His family was constantly trying to set him up on blind dates. Alistair knew all about it and was genuinely trying to help him find a way out of bachelorhood.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian added, "Freya's always working that single and available angle image, but the truth is, she has a boyfriend."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned his attention to Caroline. "And do you know who her boyfriend is?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline, in her usual display of double standards, was way less patient with Julian than she was with her husband. "Why on earth should I care who her boyfriend is?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, trust me, it definitely concerns you," Julian said, his tone suddenly serious. "Well, okay, maybe you'll think it doesn't, her boyfriend is that crazy-talented musician who's blowing up right now, Leo Reed."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's expression remained impassive. The name clearly meant nothing to her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amazingly, Alistair, the same guy Yves had jokingly accused of living in a cave, actually knew who Leo was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a major player in the music scene, a legit prodigy who'd been cranking out catchy pop anthems ever since he first hit the charts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, his phone had been inundated with ads for Leo's upcoming eight-show stint in New York.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Posters of the guy were plastered all over the city.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the way Julian was talking, Alistair got the distinct impression that Leo and Caroline had some kind of serious connection and not a good kind of friendly connection, more like their lives were tangled up in some complicated, messy way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought had barely crossed his mind when Caroline said, her voice even, "Honey, Leo's my cousin."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was genuinely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Caroline's a business titan, and her cousin's a musical genius. What is up with the super-genes in this family?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">One extended family, and they've produced two people who are at the absolute pinnacle of their respective fields. Are they actively trying to make sure no one else even gets a fighting chance?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian decided he wasn't leaving after all. He shut the door with a decisive click, then strolled back and plopped down right next to Alistair, making himself completely at home.</span></p></div>
