        <h1>Chapter 213 Nobody's Perfect</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo realized his mood wasn't quite right. Quickly composing himself, he managed a faint smile and admitted, "Yeah, I didn't sleep very well last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair didn't press further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They sat silently for a few moments, until Leo suddenly broke the quiet. "You're doing a great job."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?" Alistair raised an eyebrow slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Leo had figured out something in that brief silence. His expression softened, and meeting Alistair's gaze, he continued earnestly, "You're an excellent father to Eloise. Even among biological fathers, how many could skillfully braid their daughter's hair like you do? Honestly, I doubt I'd manage as well myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled, "Even if Eloise and I aren't related by blood, it doesn't affect our bond. She's such a lovable child; it's my honor that she sees me as her dad, and naturally, I'll always treat her as my own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shared a quiet, meaningful look. Leo's eyes suddenly reddened as emotion overcame him. "If it hadn't been for what happened back then... maybe Miley, Eloise, and I could have been just as happy as the three of you are now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair watched him silently for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned over and firmly patted Leo's shoulder, his voice gentle but serious. "Sadly, there are no second chances in life. Cherish the present; that's how you avoid further regrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo gave a bitter smile. "You're right. Even though you probably don't need to hear it, I still want to thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled quietly without saying more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the luggage was packed, they headed to Ashbourne Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would have lunch there and set out in the afternoon, traveling on the Ashbourne Group's private jet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before lunch, Gordon arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several days without seeing him, he appeared slightly older and more worn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he carefully masked it, trying hard to act as if everything were normal, he couldn't fully conceal the guilt that surfaced whenever he glanced at Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lunch passed relatively peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel was aware of Paige's situation, though under everyone's careful protection, she knew only the general details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She learned that Paige had suffered a mental breakdown and was receiving treatment, and that she'd done some questionable things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her age, Mabel understood well that some things were better left untouched. If it wasn't her place to intervene, she wouldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At two in the afternoon, after bidding affectionate goodbyes, Leo took Mabel and Eloise away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair and Caroline also departed shortly afterward. They didn't know exactly when Gordon left, but when they drove away, Alistair spotted him standing alone outside the mansion, silently watching their car until they were out of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the rearview mirror, Alistair glimpsed that powerful and wealthy man standing utterly alone, and felt a pang of sympathy mixed with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fate could be truly ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Gordon knew the entire truth, his heart must be breaking with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair felt sorry for him, yet also thought Gordon deserved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for his blind trust in his sister, how could he have allowed his own daughter to suffer so unjustly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a husband, he'd failed; he never trusted his wife enough. As a father, he was equally inadequate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, nobody was perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On their way home, they drove past a newly opened restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entrance was filled with large congratulatory flower baskets from friends and relatives, creating a festive atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had only glanced briefly, but Caroline immediately asked the driver to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Caroline in surprise, and she smiled warmly at him. "It's a friend's restaurant. Aren't you going to congratulate him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant belonged to Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron had decided he couldn't keep drifting aimlessly through life anymore. He needed something legitimate and stable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His family had been thrilled that he was finally turning over a new leaf. His parents offered their entire savings, and his sister contributed her freshly earned film payment to help him open this restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Aaron had first mentioned opening the restaurant, Alistair had offered to invest, but Aaron flatly refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stance toward Alistair was clear&mdash;if Alistair ever needed him, he'd jump in without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron regarded Alistair as a friend, someone he was willing to stand beside through thick and thin. Precisely because they were friends, Aaron wouldn't feel comfortable taking advantage of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for helping Alistair safely extract Derek earlier, it was nothing, just a simple favor and not even worth mentioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair and Caroline appeared, Aaron was genuinely surprised. He immediately expressed sincere gratitude toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Caroline's intervention, Aaron's father's surgery had gone smoothly, and he was recovering well. Soon enough, he'd be back on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron's idea to open the restaurant was inspired by his father's passion for food and cooking. His father's lifelong dream had always been to own a restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening the place gave Aaron a proper livelihood and fulfilled his father's wish. It was truly a win-win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aaron invited Alistair and Caroline inside. He instinctively reached for his cigarette pack, then quickly slid it back into his pocket upon noticing Caroline's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would've been much more at ease with Alistair alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely enough, despite coming from completely different worlds, he and Alistair clicked surprisingly well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet in front of Caroline, even Aaron, a fearless leader among street thugs, felt tense and uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. Caroline was a bona fide powerhouse. Without Alistair, someone like Aaron would never have had the opportunity to stand on equal footing with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking around, Alistair noticed the restaurant's beautiful decor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It reminded him of Vivienne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne was undeniably gifted at business. Her Viv's Brickhouse was thriving, even expanding into branches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be great if she could share some tips with Aaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alistair quickly dismissed the thought. Introducing Aaron to Vivienne didn't make sense. They belonged to entirely different worlds. He wasn't a matchmaker, so there was no need to force an acquaintance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, considering Aaron had survived so long in the underground, he was already quite sharp. Running a restaurant shouldn't be a problem for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without realizing it, Alistair had begun to see Aaron as a genuine friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he'd approached Aaron purely as a useful tool against Liam, comfortably justifying his manipulation. He'd thought Aaron wasn't exactly evil but certainly not someone virtuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after getting to know him better, Alistair realized Aaron was actually decent and incredibly loyal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before four o'clock that afternoon, Eloise and the others reached their destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo made a video call, showing Eloise and Mabel against the vibrant backdrop of a lush, beautifully blooming garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the holiday villa Leo had purchased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise's excited face was flushed bright red. "Daddy, Mommy, we're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel approached slowly, smiling warmly. "Eloise fell asleep as soon as we boarded the plane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise said regretfully, "Yeah! I slept so well last night. Why did I get sleepy so quickly? I didn't even get to see the clouds up close!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline laughed gently, asking, "Did you forget that you usually nap every afternoon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, Eloise had gotten into the habit at kindergarten. Even on weekends, she typically took a nap, but today she'd skipped it due to excitement.</span></p></div>
