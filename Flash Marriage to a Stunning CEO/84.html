        <h1>Chapter 84 We're a Real Couple</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair didn't want to say that he was reluctant to leave, because it would make him seem shamelessly eager to stay by their side, but he really didn't want to leave them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The carefully crafted mask he had been wearing finally cracked a little. Caroline, who had been observing his reaction secretly, keenly caught a trace of disappointment on his face, and she was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he jealous? Oh my god, he's really jealous!</span><br><span>After the ecstasy passed, Caroline suddenly felt a pang of pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had originally wanted to tease this man, who always pretended to be serious in front of her, a bit more. After all, Alistair had made Caroline think that he didn't like women and had made her doubt her own charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was just about to confess when she heard Alistair ask dejectedly, "Then can I see Eloise in the future? Don't worry, I won't come back to disturb your peaceful life. I'll just take a look at her at the kindergarten gate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline gave Alistair, who seemed almost humble, a complicated look, and her heart twitched violently. She had gone too far this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline wanted to tell this fool that the person she had a crush on was him. However, when the words came to her lips, she, who was usually decisive, couldn't help but feel shy. "Actually, the person I like is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first and last confession in her life, and she stammered, feeling extremely embarrassed, and her heart couldn't help but beat wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or, you can take a bold guess." On an impulse, Caroline somehow threw the question back at Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair met her expectant eyes, and his mind went blank. He blurted out, "How am I supposed to guess that? Since he's someone I know too, it can't be me, can it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he said the answer, Caroline slowly exhaled and nodded. "Congratulations. You're right." It was much easier than making her confess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair suspected that there was something wrong with his ears. It seemed that what Caroline meant was that the person she liked was him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, he not only doubted his hearing but also his ability to understand. Alistair said blankly, "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was a bit speechless. If it wasn't for his dazed look and innocent eyes like a puppy's, Caroline would have suspected that he was deliberately being naughty and wanted her to say it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stared blankly at Caroline, making her face burn. She had to hold herself together and show the imposing manner she had in the conference room when dealing with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She snatched the water glass from Alistair's hand and tilted her head back to drink the water until there wasn't a drop left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The originally warm water slid down her throat and into her stomach, cooling her down a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair looked at his hand that was still stupidly holding the empty cup.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Isn't this my water glass?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline saw his confusion and calmly explained, "This is my water glass." Then she added, "The one you just brought over for me to take my medicine with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair scanned the coffee table and found that she was right. This was really embarrassing. He had accidentally used Caroline's water glass to drink water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of their indirect kiss just now, Alistair was speechless with himself. He didn't know what he was thinking. He clearly wasn't such a boring person before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline cleared her throat awkwardly and said, "Alistair, whether your praise for me just now was false flattery or sincere, I have to say that you must take responsibility for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair's eyes widened. He didn't know what she meant by taking responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, in his almost-crashed brain, the image of his and Caroline's bodies sticking together with sticky sweat at night flashed through his mind. He didn't expect Caroline to be so conservative. Just because he had slept with her for one night, she wanted him to take responsibility for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he dismissed this thought. Alistair's mind was in a mess, as if a ball of twine had been forcefully stuffed into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline said, "I'll give you three seconds to think it over before answering me. Three, two, one. Okay, time's up. You can answer me now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline said she was giving Alistair three seconds to think things through before answering her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was impossible to figure out such a big matter in just three seconds. But she quickly finished the countdown, not even willing to give him those three seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when it came to Caroline, anyone hesitating for three seconds would be disrespectful to her stunning beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else, they would probably have eagerly agreed even before Caroline started the countdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All in all, Alistair seemed a bit ungrateful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stared at Caroline in disbelief. He opened his mouth to say something, but Caroline spoke before he could, "If you don't answer me, I'll take it as your acquiescence. Well, from now on, we're a real couple. Alistair, I'm warning you. Once I've set my heart on someone, I want to spend my whole life with him. And I'm really jealous. From now on, you're not allowed to look at other women. You can only have me in your heart. Do you hear me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay, since you've heard me, then we've reached a consensus," Caroline said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was like someone performing a monologue. She seemed to have given Alistair the right to choose, but in fact, before Alistair could even express his stance, his life event had been decided like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline decided on their marriage on a whim, then stood up and pretended to be very busy as she walked towards the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After avoiding Alistair's eyes, her face started to burn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair sat there dumbfounded and didn't move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There seemed to be an invisible rope, one end firmly tied to him and the other end tied to Caroline, then tightening and tightening, binding the two of them together so that they couldn't break free from each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Alistair didn't dislike this feeling. He silently curved his lips into a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Caroline had left. Otherwise, he was really afraid that she would see his unconcealed joy, which would seriously affect his image in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The talented and beautiful Caroline likes me...</span><br><span>He felt like he was on cloud nine, extremely elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, come to think of it, Alistair didn't understand what exactly Caroline liked about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Caroline walked out of the study. Her urgent movements startled Alistair, who was still confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was uneasy.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Has Caroline regained her senses, and is she going to tell me that she was just joking just now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm going to the company right now." Without waiting for Alistair to reply, Caroline changed her clothes and left in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She got in the car and said to the driver with a serious expression, "Take me to the kindergarten."</span></p></div>
