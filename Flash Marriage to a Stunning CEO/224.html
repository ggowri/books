        <h1>Chapter 224 Visiting Her Mother's Tomb</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Alistair saw Julian, he leaned in and spoke in a low voice, "Did Mr. Gordon </span><span>Ashbourne</span><span> stop by?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian nodded. "Yeah. I don't know what h</span><span>e said to Caroline in her office, but whatever it was, it didn't seem to put him in a good mood. I didn't dare ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is </span><span>Caroline</span><span> okay?" That was the only thing Alistair truly cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's fine," Julian said quickly and then added with a grin, "By t</span><span>he way, I hope your movie breaks box office records."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair smiled. "Thanks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to go find Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he opened the door, Caroline set down her paperwork and waited expectantly, completely relaxed and ready to be pampered. "What d</span><span>elicious meal did you bring me today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair listed the dishes one by one, and Caroline nodded with approval. "All my favorites."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thing was, Alistair had yet to find anything she didn't like. Everything he made, she always said was delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What l</span><span>eft him a bit helpless was that even though he watched her eat heartily every single day, her figure never seemed to change. Not even a pound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to ruin her good mood during lunch, Alistair didn't bring up Gordon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After their meal, during </span><span>Caroline's midday break, she sat on Alistair's lap, nibbling on fruit he fed her piece by piece. She brought up Gordon on her own. "He came to see me today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I ran into him at the elevator when I came to drop off your lunch," Alistair replied. "He looked </span><span>pretty heavy-hearted. Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had promised each other total honesty from now on. No secrets, no assumptions&mdash;just say what needed to be said, right when it needed saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline shook her head. "Not really. He came in looking troubled.</span><span>.. and said he had something he needed to confess. He told me... that my mom passed away a long time ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Alistair didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People were complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon had trusted his own eyes more than Lillian's explanations. His refusa</span><span>l to believe her had broken her heart and eventually torn their marriage apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had placed blind faith in Paige and lacked the sense of responsibility a father should have had toward Caroline. His failures had brought her a great deal of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet </span><span>somewhere in his heart, he had never let go of the wife he believed had betrayed him. Otherwise, how else would he have known that Lillian had died overseas?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final stage of Lillian's life had overlapped with the period when Caroline was being "discipli</span><span>ned" by Paige. During that time, Gordon had been flying overseas every few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had assumed it was for work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, he had been by Lillian's side as she neared the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian hadn't wanted to see him, so he would sit quietly in a corner un</span><span>til she fell asleep. Then he would move to her bedside, watching the woman he both loved and resented, her body wasted away by illness. He had sat there, consumed by a tangle of emotions he could never quite name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had "betrayed" him, and yet he was sur</span><span>e he could never love another woman again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she passed, he told no one. He quietly brought her ashes home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lillian had always dreamed of a peaceful, pastoral life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon purchased an entire mountain and the lake below it, selecting her resting place </span><span>in silence, honoring her wish without ever speaking of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't even sure why he'd done it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was because she had been the mother of his child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gently ran his fingers through Caroline's hair, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He did love your mom," he</span><span> said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline's eyes glistened with tears. "Will you go with me to where she's buried, one day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave a soft nod, his voice low. "Of course. Wherever you go, I'm going too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline let out a breath that sounded almost like a laugh. "Jus</span><span>t don't go anywhere dangerous for me. I couldn't stand that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the last day of the year, they visited Lillian's resting place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the middle of winter, the mountain was beautiful, and the lake beside it was just as lovely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Halfway up the slope, Gord</span><span>on had built a modest house&mdash;not grand, but clearly lived in. The signs of daily use showed he often stayed here, quietly keeping Lillian company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline brought Alistair to her mother's tomb. She used a lighthearted tone, as if hosting a grand introducti</span><span>on, and formally presented Alistair to Lillian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline believed that, wherever her mother was now, she would want her daughter to be happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> she didn't want to let her see her cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stood in front of the tombstone with a solemn </span><span>expression and vowed that he would cherish Caroline for the rest of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "What about the next life? And the one after that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair quickly corrected himself and raised his hand toward the sky. "Ma'am, I swea</span><span>r&mdash;life after life, I will only love Caroline. If I ever break that&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, that's enough," Caroline cut him off protectively. "She's already heard you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stayed there until past four in the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline stood up. "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistai</span><span>r nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked down the mountain, a sudden gust of wind stirred the fallen leaves into a swirling dance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline paused and looked back. "Is she saying goodbye?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair answered, "Yeah. She's waving us off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned and gave the tombstone a </span><span>gentle wave. "We're heading out now, ma'am. We'll come back to visit soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind settled. Everything returned to stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time, let's bring Eloise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too cold up in the mountains today, so they hadn't brought her along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That </span><span>evening, they had a New Year's Eve dinner at </span><span>Ashbourne</span><span> Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon and Leo were both there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise was full of energy, insisting that she stay up to watch the clock strike midnight. But as a child, her limits caught up with her by ten thirty, and she </span><span>started nodding off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo leaned in and whispered in her ear, "Sweetheart, go ahead and sleep. I'll wake you up right before midnight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise held out her pinky. "You're the best! Pinky promise&mdash;no backing out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the warmth of that joyful family e</span><span>vening, Caroline leaned over to Mabel and shared a secret. "Grandma, Eloise is actually Leo's biological daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel let out a long sigh but showed no sign of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline and Alistair exchanged a glance. Her reaction was so calm. Could it be...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You came home one day with a child, saying you were going to raise her as your own. </span><span>Of course</span><span> we had to do some digging," Mabel said frankly. "I wasn't the only one who looked into it&mdash;your father did too. He's the one who told me Eloise was Leo's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alist</span><span>air glanced toward the sitting room. Gordon was over there, on yet another phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had barely spent any time with the family before his phone kept ringing non-stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wasn't on a call, he was on his way to take one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mabel, already </span><span>advanced in age, went to bed not long after Eloise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the clock struck midnight and they had officially rung in the New Year, Alistair and Caroline headed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon personally walked them to the door and asked the driver to keep it steady on the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simple words, but they carried all the warmth of an elder who truly cared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair gave a wave. "Mr. Gordon </span><span>Ashbourne</span><span>, see you tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon had long since become immune to his mock-formal address. He smiled and said, "Yeah, tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, h</span><span>is eyes swept across Caroline's face, and he let out a quiet sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least now, they could coexist peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for anything more... he had learned to stop hoping.</span></p></div>
