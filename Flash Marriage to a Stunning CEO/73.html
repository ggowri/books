        <h1>Chapter 73 A Family of Three</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, even when Alistair felt the eyes on him from that window on the second floor, he didn't feel like waving or saying hi anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carried on like normal. This</span><span> whole thing didn't mess with his life one bit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes he figured watching him was one of the only fun things for that kid stuck inside all the time. If he could add a little bit of excitement to that kid's boring world, he was happy to do it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, i</span><span>t didn't hurt him any. As long as it didn't get in the way of his life, he didn't give it a second thought.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Liam sold the old apartment and bought a new place in New York. Alistair and Robert had to move out and rent a place for two months.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the</span><span> old apartment was gone, it felt like they'd lost their home base back in their hometown. Since Alistair nailed his exams and got into a school in New York, Robert took him there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's thinking was simple. Better schools in the city meant a better shot</span><span> at college and an easier life down the road.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things didn't always turn out as expected. If Robert had known what Alistair&mdash;the kid he'd placed all his hopes in&mdash;had endured, he would have regretted that decision deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But was it his fault? No way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thi</span><span>s was on Rebecca and Liam. You couldn't blame Robert for trying his best.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair thought it over and decided that the apartment had some kind of hold on Caroline. But it never crossed his mind to link Caroline to that kid peeking at him from the second-f</span><span>loor window.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered that kid was a boy! The skinny figure he'd glimpsed had a crew cut.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they moved in, neighbors said they'd seen a little boy with short hair. He looked at least eight or nine years old.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Girls that age usually grow their hair o</span><span>ut. Who'd want a crew cut? So just based on the haircut, everyone figured it was a boy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair had no clue what Caroline's deal was with that apartment, but it must have happened after he left for New York.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head told him to stay out of it. It wasn't </span><span>his problem. But his heart said he couldn't just do nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline had been so good to him. And little Eloise was so sweet and well-behaved.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without realizing it, Alistair had started seeing them as family. When trouble came, he didn't stop to think if </span><span>it was his business or not. All he knew was he had to help.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair decided to wait till Monday. He'd drop Eloise off at kindergarten, and then, since he'd be free all day, he'd head back to Chicago. He planned to chat up the neighbors to see if there was</span><span> anything going on between Caroline and that apartment. He just couldn't stop worrying until he knew.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he got home, it was late. Sandra had dinner ready. After they ate, he went for a walk with Caroline and Eloise as always.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, are you tire</span><span>d?" Eloise asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not at all," Alistair replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy, are you sure you're not tired?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, didn't you say I'm even cooler than Superman? A little walk like this is nothing. I could do this all day!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise had run around a ton that day, so Alistair ju</span><span>st plopped her on his shoulders. She'd watched other kids do that before, staring with big, jealous eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she had a dad too, she was over the moon. Up on his shoulders, she felt so tall&mdash;taller than both Alistair and Caroline. She was super </span><span>excited but kept asking if he was okay, worried she was too heavy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That Body Fortification Pill was no joke. Ever since he started taking it, Alistair had been full of energy 24/7.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise weighed next to nothing to him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Eloise would walk between th</span><span>em, holding both their hands. But now, with her up high, Caroline ended up walking right beside Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were so close that Eloise could see them brushing against each other as they walked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People couldn't help but stare at their good-looking family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, Alistair hated getting stared at, but this time, he loved it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to shout to the world that he was Eloise's dad and Caroline's husband!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an old couple nearby said, "Look at that perfect family," Alistair smiled. He wondered if Liam had g</span><span>otten the "surprise" he'd sent yet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't take this anymore! You hit me because of that little brat? My life is one big nightmare! I'm filing for divorce!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the messy apartment, Celeste, her face half-swollen, went ballistic, </span><span>scratching and biting Liam like a wildcat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam was cold-blooded towards Alistair, but he adored Celeste. The second he laid a hand on her, he regretted it. He let her go off for a while, but when she just kept escalating, he shoved her away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste lande</span><span>d hard on the couch, hair a mess, eyes blazing. "You really gonna hand that little bastard five million dollars? Listen up&mdash;every dime of yours is Caleb's. That little rat doesn't get a penny. You swore we'd cut that bitch's kid out. Break that promise, and</span><span> I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam slumped in his seat, scowling, and said in a defeated voice, "He knows about six years ago. What the hell am I supposed to do now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam never cared much about his first wife. She died young, and whatever feelings they had died with h</span><span>er. That went double for the kid she left behind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly moved on, formed a new family, and completely put his old life behind him. If Alistair hadn't been serious this time, he wouldn't have taken Alistair seriously at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam took a deep breath. "T</span><span>ell me the truth. Did you lie about Alistair flunking the exam?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste didn't miss a beat. "When have I ever lied to you? He barely scraped 20 points. I saw the score myself. And even if he'd gone to college, so what? He wouldn't have brought in two mill</span><span>ion dollars."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam stayed quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without that two million dollars, we wouldn't be able to buy a new apartment. Caleb wouldn't be studying abroad. We did what we had to. That little brat's the one to blame. He's got no loyalty, doesn't give a damn about th</span><span>is family!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celeste twisted the story inside out, pinning everything on Alistair. She cussed him out, then laughed in Liam's face. "Grow a pair! You're pushing fifty, scared of some punk? So what if he knew about six years ago? Where's his proof? As long a</span><span>s we keep our mouths shut, he's got nothing!"</span></p></div>
