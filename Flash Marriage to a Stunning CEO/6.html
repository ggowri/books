        <h1>Chapter 6 A Worthless Nobody</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne leaned forward, her tone teasing but earnest. "If you're really done with him, Rebecca, I might just make a move on Alistair. Fair game, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words stoked the irritation simmering in Rebecca's chest. With a dismissive smirk, Rebecca shot back, "Vivienne, since when did your taste sink so low? You're not seriously into Alistair, are you? He's got no degree, no background... He's a complete loser. What exactly do you see in him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne's eyes flashed with defiance as she stood up for him. "Rebecca, you've been so busy picking apart his flaws that you've missed what makes him special. Sure, he doesn't come from money, but not everyone gets a lucky break.<br>"But no education? Come on, Rebecca, don't you feel a little guilty saying that? If it weren't for you, he wouldn't have missed his SATs. I remember he was a stellar student back in high school."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne and Rebecca had been classmates, and though Alistair moved in different circles, his reputation as an academic star had reached even their privileged clique.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca let out a derisive huff, a flicker of unease crossing her eyes before her usual haughty mask snapped back into place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne pressed on, undeterred. "He's good-looking, thoughtful, steady, and he knows how to take care of people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca rolled her eyes, cutting her off. "Oh, please, spare me. He's not half as perfect as you're making him out to be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne arched a brow. "Isn't he? If he wasn't so meticulous in looking after you and Daniel, do you honestly think you'd have kept him around for six years? I know you, Rebecca. You used him to get under Rick's skin, but if he wasn't pulling his weight, you'd have ditched him ages ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rebecca fell silent, her lips tightening. She had no comeback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a long pause, she muttered defensively, "It wasn't about that. I paid off his dad's two-million-dollar debt. He owed me. If I'd let him off the hook early, I'd have been shortchanged."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne shook her head, a wry smile tugging at her lips. "You got a steal, Rebecca. Forget two million dollars. I'd shell out five to find a guy who'd care for me the way Alistair did for you and Daniel for six years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anne, quick to jump to Rebecca's defense, scoffed, "Vivienne, whose side are you on? Why are you hyping up this guy? He's a schemer, plain and simple. A smooth-talking charmer who's got you wrapped around his finger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivienne sighed, unfazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew she was speaking the truth, and that was enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Trying to steer the conversation elsewhere, she glanced at her watch. "It's getting late, Rebecca. Aren't you picking up Danny? Alistair's probably not handling that anymore, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the reminder about Danny</span>, Rebecca pulled out her phone and noticed five missed calls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd accidentally silenced it and hadn't noticed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three of them were from the same unfamiliar number. It was Maggie, from the kindergarten. However, since Alistair always handled </span><span>Daniel's school matters, Rebecca had never dealt with the staff or saved their numbers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ignored the unknown calls, but the last two missed calls made her mood shift in an unexpected way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were from Alistair.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't fathom why he'd called.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her</span><span> first thought was that, after leaving her, he'd realized he couldn't survive in the cutthroat world alone.</span><br><span>He must've realized he can't make it out there on his own. Now he's trying to crawl back, hoping I'll throw him a bone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea soothed her frayed </span><span>nerves, a smug satisfaction settling in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at "Alistair" on her screen for a couple of seconds, picturing him pacing anxiously when she didn't pick up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca dialed his number with deliberate nonchalance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call connected almost instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bef</span><span>ore he could get a word in, Rebecca pounced. "Alistair, what's wrong with you? Who gave you permission to call me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brief silence followed, and then Alistair's voice came through, calm and steady.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice had a unique quality. It was low, clear, almost</span><span> magnetic. Someone once joked that Alistair could charm anyone with his voice alone. Unfortunately, he rarely spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when they were together, he was so quiet it felt like living with a mute.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's the thing," he said evenly. "Danny's kindergarten te</span><span>acher called me. She said no one picked him up after school, and he was crying his eyes out. He didn't want to come with me, and given my situation now, it wouldn't have been right for me to take him. </span><span>So</span><span> I called to let you know you need to get him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne,</span><span> eavesdropping, chimed in with a snide tone, "Oh, Alistair, that's the lamest excuse I've ever heard. You're not even good at lying! Don't you know? Danny's real dad picked him up today. There's no way Rick would leave his own son stranded at kindergarten.</span><span> What kind of father would let his kid go through that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca's brows knitted </span><span>together,</span><span> her voice sharp with anger. "Didn't I tell you yesterday to stop dragging Danny into your games? Don't overestimate your importance, Alistair. Pull this again, and y</span><span>ou'll regret it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she slammed the call to an end.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oddly, while Rebecca seemed furious at Alistair's supposed scheming, a strange satisfaction coursed through her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pent-up frustration she'd been carrying found an outlet, leaving her feeling l</span><span>ighter, almost giddy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne urged her not to let someone like Alistair get under her skin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne, however, looked thoughtful. "Maybe you should call Richard to double-check."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anne's jaw dropped. "Vivienne, are you serious? You're siding with Alistair ove</span><span>r Rick? You're hopeless!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne stood her ground. "This isn't about picking sides. It's about Danny. A quick call can clear things up. Better to be safe than sorry."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was Vivienne's logic or Rebecca's desire to expose Alistair's lies, she dial</span><span>ed Richard's number.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, babe, miss me already?" Richard's warm, velvety voice came through, prompting a teasing giggle from Anne at their obvious closeness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca playfully scolded him, "Behave, my friends are right here. How's Danny doing? Is he </span><span>being good?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange silence hung on the line.</span></p></div>
