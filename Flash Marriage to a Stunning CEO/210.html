        <h1>Chapter 210 The Arrest</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa discreetly nudged Richard. "Richard, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as they moved, someone in the crowd suddenly whispered, "The police are here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned toward the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of uniformed officers surged into the mall, moving swiftly toward them with clear intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone in the crowd woke up excitedly from their stupor. "They're here for Alistair! Thank heavens, after dragging on for so long, we're finally getting justice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Justice will prevail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd instantly erupted into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Eloise lifted her head, twisting in her father's arms to look around, and declared loudly, "You're all lying! My daddy isn't a bad person! Those officers aren't here for him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard trembled with excitement at the sight of the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd waited and waited, hoping desperately for this moment, and now it had finally come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Alistair would pay for his supposed crimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So what if he was innocent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still the perfect scapegoat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon didn't acknowledge Alistair as his son-in-law. With Alistair having damaged his business' reputation, Gordon must hate his guts by now. Surely, he couldn't wait to see Alistair arrested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair stood calmly, still holding Eloise, and quietly reassured them, "Don't worry, they're not here for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise responded matter-of-factly, "Of course they aren't here for you, Daddy! Police officers only arrest bad people, and you're not a bad person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her childish voice showed not a hint of fear or nervousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was slightly surprised by her complete trust. Turning his gaze to Caroline, he saw the same calm certainty on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trust was the foundation upon which a family was built.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time he'd been taken away from the Ashbourne Manor by police, Caroline's biggest concern hadn't been whether he'd done anything wrong, but rather if he'd get proper rest given the detention conditions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Caroline hadn't trusted his character implicitly, how could she have devoted herself wholeheartedly to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't someone who gave her trust easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over ten years ago, she'd secretly observed and studied Alistair meticulously for an entire year. Although they hadn't interacted much back then, during that lonely year, Alistair had practically become her whole world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a man with a thousand masks couldn't have hidden his true nature from her sharp eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Richard, overwhelmed with excitement and eager to witness Alistair's downfall, waved enthusiastically toward the approaching officers and pointed directly at Alistair. "He's right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eloise clenched her fists angrily. "Bad guy! He's the real bad guy! Officers, don't listen to him. He's the villain here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Eloise glared fiercely at Richard before suddenly gasping in recognition. "Daddy, isn't he the dad of the boy who tried to steal you from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair nodded calmly. "That's right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realization dawned on Eloise's face. "No wonder that little boy was so unlikeable; his dad is just as awful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two didn't bother to lower their voices or hide their conversation; everyone around them heard clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How arrogant Alistair was, even now, moments before his downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Keep laughing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Laugh all you want. Soon, you won't have the chance anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People around them held mixed feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some began to doubt Alistair's guilt. Would he really remain this calm if he'd done anything wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others grew even angrier, seeing his composure as proof that he had powerful backers and felt untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Officer, that's Alistair right there!" Richard pointed again, nearly unable to contain his glee as the police got closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the smile on his face quickly froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sharp click, a pair of silver handcuffs snapped shut around the wrists of the suspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard stared blankly at the officers, then at his stunned mother. His eyes finally settled in disbelief on Theresa's handcuffed wrists. "Officer, there must be some mistake," Richard stammered desperately. "Alistair is right there. Why are you arresting my mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead officer ignored Richard completely, turning instead to Theresa. "Theresa Morgan, you're under arrest for the murder of Antonio Baldwin. You'll need to come with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa's eyes widened in shock, as if she'd just heard something utterly impossible. "What did you say? You're accusing me of murdering Antonio?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Antonio mentioned was none other than her own flesh and blood&mdash;her younger brother and Richard's uncle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to evidence gathered by the police, Antonio Baldwin had been murdered at around 1:30 a.m. that day in a local hotel. The cause of death was suffocation. Someone had covered his nose and mouth while he was unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, his body had been packed into a wooden crate for disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The driver transporting the body had been intercepted by witnesses and apprehended by police. Under interrogation, the driver confessed the entire plot, naming Theresa as the mastermind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more astonishingly, investigators discovered evidence linking Theresa to the car accident involving Nathaniel and his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karma truly had a twisted sense of justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When eyewitness videos of the murder went viral, the authorities had expected Theresa to flee immediately upon hearing the news, potentially complicating their arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd never anticipated she would be leisurely shopping at a mall, blissfully unaware of the unfolding chaos. She was too busy celebrating a successfully sealed business deal alongside her son to even check her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had the police tracked her down so quickly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For that, they had Richard to thank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to stomach Alistair's success, Richard had deliberately invited an influencer group to ambush Alistair with a live-streamed confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they harassed Alistair and his family in the name of "public justice", Theresa and Richard had inadvertently appeared on camera, immediately tipping off authorities to their exact location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How had things spiraled so absurdly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police weren't here for Alistair at all, but for his own mother?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Officer, there must be some misunderstanding! Antonio is my uncle, my mother's own brother!" Richard desperately pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watching, except for Alistair's family, stood equally dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth was happening here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though disappointed that the police hadn't come for Alistair after all, they couldn't deny that the new twist was highly entertaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why walk away instead of enjoying the show?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa was utterly bewildered. "Officer, you must be mistaken. My brother's out traveling. How could he possibly be dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more absurdly, how could the person accused of killing him be her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa had only one brother. She'd loved him dearly; hurting him was inconceivable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her stubborn disbelief, an officer pulled out a photograph. "Look carefully. Isn't this Antonio Baldwin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theresa's eyes fell on the photo clearly depicting Antonio's lifeless body. Her face drained of all color, her lips trembled violently, and she made a choked, strangled noise before collapsing unconscious on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom! Mom!" Richard cried desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Richard was also taken into custody for questioning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enthralled crowd followed them eagerly out of the mall, watching until Richard and Theresa were loaded into police cars and driven away, leaving reluctantly afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their excitement, the crowd completely forgot about Alistair's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for them, although it was easy to forget their careless or intentional cruelty when targeting innocent people, this time they'd crossed a line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of them would soon pay the price for their actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline turned icily to the mall's manager, her voice commanding. "Identify every last person captured on surveillance footage. I don't want a single one missed."</span></p></div>
