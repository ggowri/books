        <h1>Chapter 46 Personal Charm</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Come to think of it, Eloise hadn't said much either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel fell quiet for a moment. "Her mother's been living overseas for years. Rarely comes back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Doesn't that mean her parents live apart?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So they were probably separated, maybe even divorced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her father's always working. He and Caroline barely see each other. I was the one who raised her, really. She once told me she'd never marry. Said she'd rather be alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair didn't think it was just because of her parents' example. No&mdash;Caroline had her own reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But then... who's Eloise's father?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had ever told him. Maybe that wasn't an accident. Maybe it was better if that name stayed buried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And frankly, it wasn't his place to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel sighed heavily, falling back into old worries, "God, I used to lie awake at night thinking about her future. I know it sounds old-fashioned, but no amount of money or success can compare to a happy home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair thought of his own life&mdash;how he'd once planned to live alone forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't a bad life. Peaceful. Uncomplicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, suddenly, the thought of eating alone, coming home to silence, sleeping in an empty bed... felt cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel patted his hand warmly. "Thank God for you, Alistair. You've given me hope again. Caroline won't be alone anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gave his hand another squeeze, her eyes soft with affection. Mabel now really saw him as part of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the kind of belief that made everything else&mdash;every doubt, every fear&mdash;quiet down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're a good man," Mabel said with conviction. "With you, I know Caroline is in safe hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair met her gaze, trying not to feel guilty. He kept his voice steady. "I won't let you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, not during the time their marriage lasted. While it existed, he'd give her and Eloise everything he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He remembered Agnes' words again&mdash;something about Caroline's father being strict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I haven't met her parents yet," he said. "Do you think they'll... approve of me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel waved the thought away. "Don't worry about them. They don't even show up for Caroline. Who are they to judge her husband? With me around, no one's going to give you trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were so wrapped up in conversation that they didn't notice Caroline walk in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She cleared her throat. "Grandma, you didn't spend the whole time talking trash about me behind my back, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was fresh from the office, dressed in a pale tailored suit, jacket slung over one arm. The weather had warmed up. Underneath, she wore a crisp white blouse that framed her clean, graceful lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could picture her in a boardroom, taking control, sharp as a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their eyes met, and Caroline smiled. She was clearly pleased to see how easily Alistair had connected with Mabel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel clicked her tongue. "As if I'd dare say anything bad about you in front of your husband. He'd probably take your side anyway and throw me out the window."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lunch was plentiful, and Caroline naturally took the seat beside Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel, beaming, kept piling food onto Alistair's plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, it was overflowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline put down her fork and rested her chin in her hand, watching them in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then her gaze locked on Alistair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He blinked. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She studied him, head to toe. "Be honest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked completely lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Be honest and?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you secretly casting some kind of charm spell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair blinked, unsure how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd heard that question before&mdash;Julian had asked him the exact same thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when Mabel pulled him aside earlier, she hadn't said it outright, but there'd been a similar undertone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now Caroline?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is this really all me? Or has the system been juicing my stats behind the scenes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel playfully scolded, "You little brat. If I'd ignored Alistair, you'd have cried about it. But now that I adore him, you're sulking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline smiled, her eyes softening in a rare, girlish way, "I'm happy. If anyone dares touch my husband in the future, I won't have to lift a finger. Grandma will take care of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel scoffed, "You're just jealous I like him more than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair listened to them bicker, lips tugging into a smile. He couldn't help but silently ask the system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Be honest. Mabel's approval&mdash;is this something you engineered?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This system can only help the host make life choices and reward outcomes accordingly. Personal charm is all yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exhaled, almost laughing.</span><br><span>So it really is me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was just him&mdash;whatever it was in him that Eloise had warmed to, that had made Caroline choose him, that had earned Mabel's approval. That part had always been there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Maybe he wasn't as humble as he used to think. Maybe he'd always had this light in him&mdash;it had just taken the right people to see it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After lunch, Caroline got up to return to work. Mabel tried to keep Alistair a little longer, wanting more time with him, but Caroline was already calling out, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel gave up with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They're newlyweds. Of course she wants him all to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Alistair was about to step into the car, Mabel pulled Caroline aside. "When are you two planning the wedding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Traditional as ever, Mabel had always believed that a marriage without a proper ceremony felt... incomplete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline paused. "Too much of a hassle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mabel sighed, "Poor Alistair."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not bothered," Alistair said quickly. "Really."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The simpler, the better. After all, their marriage wasn't even real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the ride back, Alistair asked casually, "Do you usually have lunch with your grandma?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline shook her head. "Not really."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ashbourne Manor was a bit far from her office. Going back and forth ate up over an hour&mdash;and longer in traffic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair wanted to ask, then why today? But he didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know that it was because of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As usual, she dropped him off at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Had it been up to her, she would've driven him right to the elevator doors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two blocks away would've sufficed, but she refused. She didn't stop until she pulled up directly in front of his building.</span></p></div>
