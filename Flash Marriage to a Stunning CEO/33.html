        <h1>Chapter 33 Crazy Granddaughter</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair was about to answer Mabel's questions one by one, but Caroline spoke first, "Grandma, why are you asking so many questions? Don't you trust my taste in choosing men?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel froze for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled and joked, "I was just chatting with Alistair. I'm not gonna bite him. Look at you; you haven't even married him yet, and you're already speaking for him, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline replied, "Grandma, I was just about to tell you something. We have already gotten our marriage certificate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel had been around and had experienced many ups and downs. She had long since developed a strong and calm heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she accidentally learned from Julian that Caroline seemed to be dating someone, she couldn't wait to dig out what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she knew her granddaughter too well, and she immediately thought of a possibility. A basin of water seemed to be poured on her excited heart, and it suddenly turned cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back then, Caroline insisted on adopting Eloise despite everyone's opposition. Some people said that Eloise's existence would make many outstanding men stay away from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, most capable and competent men would not want to be someone else's stepfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that time, Caroline responded bluntly, saying that she wouldn't like those people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The facts proved that no matter whether it was a man or a woman, as long as they were good enough, certain shortcomings could be completely ignored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not to mention that Caroline was a talented woman. Even if it was just her outstanding appearance, even though everyone knew that she had a kid, she still had many suitors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Among these suitors, there were heirs from wealthy families who were as good as the Ashbourne family, geniuses who had achieved remarkable success at a young age, and top celebrities who thrived in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Caroline was 24 years old, yet she had never dated anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Logically speaking, she was still young, and there was no need for Mabel to worry too much about her marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Mabel was anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Caroline never met someone she loved in her lifetime, Mabel was worried that she would be lonely all her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel's mind was not outdated. She was a lovely old lady who was willing to accept new things. She thought people had different sexual orientations. She believed that as long as it did not affect others, it was other people's freedom to choose how to live their lives, and it should be respected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This standard would work for anyone else, but not for her granddaughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Actually, she had a traditional heart, and she still hoped that Caroline could get married, have children, and live the life that a normal person would have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Later, Caroline was not as persistent as before and was willing to go on the blind dates Mabel arranged, but Mabel still couldn't be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel knew that Caroline just wanted to find a father for her adopted daughter, not a husband for herself. These were two completely different things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel guessed that Caroline had found a suitable father for Eloise, and her enthusiasm faded by half. However, when she saw Caroline, who had never been interested in men, holding hands with a strange guy for the first time, Mabel's hope was rekindled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Caroline didn't really like him, how could she be willing to be so close to him?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel was very happy. She saw that Alistair was tall, sunny, and handsome. He was polite when he talked to her. Mabel thought that her granddaughter had good taste, and she was satisfied with the young man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel felt like maybe she could really see Caroline find happiness during her lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel's smile hadn't faded when she suddenly heard Caroline tell her that they had obtained a marriage certificate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel, who should have been happier, suddenly became alert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of Caroline, who was usually well-behaved but occasionally gets crazy, Mabel felt like her heart skipped a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Without knowing each other, they just got the certificate directly. Isn't it just because she thinks I'm worrying too much and annoyed that she has to go on blind dates every other day, so she just finds a random guy to avoid blind dates?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But marriage is a big deal. How can she treat it so casually?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even if it is a fake marriage, and even if they divorce someday, it will be different.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The first marriage and the second can never be the same.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel was angry at Caroline for not taking marriage seriously. Since Alistair was present, she couldn't get angry, so she said with a sigh, "Oh, why didn't you tell us about such a big thing in advance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline said lazily, "It's me who's getting married, not you. I've got the certificate, whether you say yes or no. Besides, I just told you, didn't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel was speechless for a long time upon hearing Caroline's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel's heart sank.<br>Is it the same to say it in advance or now? This girl is just changing the concept!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair looked at Caroline with a little surprise and happened to catch Caroline's bright eyes. Caroline's eyes were slightly curved, as if to say, "Didn't that scare you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair replied with just a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caroline was from a wealthy family, and Alistair thought that they must have a lot of rules. After all, Rebecca's family had a lot of rules, and it seemed that he was the only one bound by the rules.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at the interaction between Caroline and Mabel, Alistair realized that he was overthinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The casual air between Caroline and Mabel made him feel very relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel shook her head and said to Eloise with a smile, "Good girl, I will give you a task, okay? It's the first time for this sir to come to our house. Can you take him out for a walk? The blossoms in the backyard are blooming. They are so beautiful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eloise looked around in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Only my dad and Julian are present. Who is the "sir" Great-grandma mentioned?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Mabel pointed at Alistair with a smile, Eloise immediately corrected, "Great-grandma, he is my dad!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mabel widened her eyes, unsure of what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair understood that Mabel had something to say to Caroline alone. As for the content, he knew it was related to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He and Caroline got married after knowing each other for only one day. It would be strange if her family didn't ask about the whole thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maybe Mabel would even think that Caroline was deceived by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The situation was like when Rebecca took him back to meet her family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What Alistair could be sure of was that Caroline would definitely not allow him to be beaten with a belt or scolded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could tell that Mabel was not an unreasonable person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alistair suddenly paused.<br>By the way, why aren't Caroline's parents here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He greeted Mabel politely and then stood up and walked out with Eloise's help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Julian threw the orange peel into the trash can, picked up another orange, and walked out.</p></div>
