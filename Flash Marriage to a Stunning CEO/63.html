        <h1>Chapter 63 A Move Made Without Asking</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, rage and shame crashed over her like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the voices that once warned her echoed back, clearer than ever.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when she had her whole life ahead of her, she gave it all up&mdash;for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Carried his bab</span><span>y, thinking it would bind them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dreamed of a future. A family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God, how could she have been so stupid?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so angry she almost felt calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rebecca knew better than to meet brute force with brute force. That never ended well. And she</span><span>'</span><span>d already lost more </span><span>than she could afford.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, she pushed herself off the floor, retrieved her cracked phone, and walked into the bedroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door clicked shut behind her, the lock sliding into place with a quiet finality. Only then did the tears begin to fall.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>O</span><span>utside, Richard mistook her silence for shame. He stormed up to the door and pounded on it, his voice shaking with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Rebecca! Open the damn door! Just tell me the truth&mdash;what</span><span>'</span><span>s going on between you and Alistair? Have you been lying to me this whole tim</span><span>e?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I gave up everything to come back to you. And this is what I get? Don</span><span>'</span><span>t you even feel a shred of guilt?!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists battered the wood like thunder.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Rebecca</span><span>'</span><span>s hands trembled as she tapped the emergency call button on the fractured screen.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>911, what</span><span>'</span><span>s your emergency?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Yes,</span><span>"</span><span> she said, voice tight with fear. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Someone broke in and tried to hurt me. I</span><span>'</span><span>m locked in the bedroom, but he</span><span>'</span><span>s right outside. Please&mdash;he</span><span>'</span><span>s going to kill me.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ended the call, then opened her camera and hit record.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The f</span><span>ootage showed the door rattling under Richard</span><span>'</span><span>s assault, his threats crystal clear through the grainy audio.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t stop.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn</span><span>'</span><span>t apologize.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn</span><span>'</span><span>t back down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the door never opened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, minutes later, the sound that answered him wasn</span><span>'</span><span>t her </span><span>voice&mdash;but the rising wail of sirens.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the sirens reached her ears, Rebecca flung open the bedroom door and ran out, her body shaking, eyes red with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn</span><span>'</span><span>t hesitate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throwing herself into the arms of the nearest officer, she cried out, </span><span>voice cracking with panic, </span><span>"</span><span>That</span><span>'</span><span>s him! He broke in&mdash;he tried to assault me! When I said no, he lost it! He said he</span><span>'</span><span>d kill me!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every word hit like a match to gasoline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers moved fast&mdash;no questions, no hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of them surged forward, closing</span><span> in on Richard with swift, practiced efficiency.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hands where we can see them!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could get a word out, Richard was slammed face-first onto the hardwood, his wrists yanked behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t fight back. The so-called playboy, the pampered heir, </span><span>didn</span><span>'</span><span>t stand a chance against seasoned officers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he lay there, frozen&mdash;eyes wide, breath shallow, chest rising in shock, not resistance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What the hell?! </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">She</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s the one who lied. She</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s the one who cheated. </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So why does it look like I</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'</span><span style="font-style: italic;">m the criminal?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That</span><span> slap wiped out every last illusion Rebecca had about Richard.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was done with him&mdash;completely. At the police station, she firmly insisted that Richard had tried to harm her, refusing to let the officers write it off as just some domestic dispute between </span><span>an engaged couple.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between the bruises on her face and her unwavering testimony, the evidence spoke for itself. Richard was placed under administrative detention for fourteen days.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair, of course, knew none of this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Saturday morning, the three of </span><span>them sat together at the breakfast table, a picture of calm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, they set off for a family outing to fly kites.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were plenty of kite-friendly spots in New York, but the grassy area by the river near Ashbourne Manor was a </span><span>particularly popular one.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair assumed Caroline would take them there&mdash;maybe even stop by Mabel's for a quick visit. Two birds, one stone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the car drove farther and farther away from the city center, that assumption began to crumble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Eloise,</span><span> watching the view blur past the windows, started to frown. "Mommy, where are we going to fly kites?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Eloise could sense something was off, Alistair certainly could.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline replied, "Somewhere we haven't been before."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that means we won't get to v</span><span>isit Great-grandma today? Won't she be sad?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, sweetie. I already called her. We'll visit her later."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, okay."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alistair sat silently, watching the scenery shift.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had zoned out somewhere around the halfway point. When he looked up again, t</span><span>he skyline was gone&mdash;replaced by stretches of low buildings, cracked sidewalks, and streets that looked too familiar to be coincidence. His eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a weathered sign came into view reading "Welcome to Chicago," the realization hit him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caroline h</span><span>ad driven them all the way to his hometown.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They drove all night... That was... not exactly a casual kite-flying distance.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced sideways at Caroline.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This isn't a coincidence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he second-guessed himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If she wanted to do something for me, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">wouldn't she have brought me to Liam's place in New York, not all the way out to my old neighborhood? Don't overthink it. It's just a trip. Nothing more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They ended up at a park not far from where he used to live&mdash;a hill-shouldered lake with a wide, grassy </span><span>field at the base. It had long been turned into a tourist-friendly spot, perfect for flying kites.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chicago might not have the shine and scale of New York, but it had its own charm&mdash;and plenty of space to play.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But of all the places they could've gone, this </span><span>was far too close to home. Literally. Alistair had a hard time convincing himself this was just a happy accident.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lake carried a breeze that smelled of wild grass and flowers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a kid, he used to come here with his bike, fishing and catching shrimp by</span><span> the water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Summers were filled with swimming and laughter, all with a few close friends.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were a lot of good memories here&mdash;warm, simple, untouched.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, those memories felt distant. The place was the same, but he wasn't.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Caroline, uncer</span><span>tain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked completely unbothered, as if this really was nothing but a scenic spot she'd stumbled across.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I'm reading into it. Maybe she doesn't know. Maybe it really is just a coincidence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed the thoughts aside and focused on </span><span>Eloise, who was already dashing around with a bright red kite.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They flew kites all morning. Caught tadpoles. Found a bird's nest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, Eloise insisted they let everything go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tadpoles belonged in the wild. Eggs needed their mama bird.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course she s</span><span>aid that&mdash;she was an angel.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By noon, stomachs were growling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time to find lunch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they drove through the town, Alistair grew quiet. The streets, the buildings, the shapes of the signs&mdash;so much of it hadn't changed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he broke the silence. "My father</span><span>'s house used to be just a few blocks from here."</span></p></div>
