        <h1>Chapter 105 Rope</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne knew better than anyone that Rebecca had waited six long years for Richard to come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even if she waited ten times that, she'd never see Alistair return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair had always kept his distance from Rebecca's domineering ways, and now, with a perfect wife by his side, it was clear he'd moved on for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Rebecca had mentioned it over the phone, Vivienne had brushed it off as jealousy, thinking Rebecca was reading too much into things. But seeing it with her own eyes? It was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It hasn't been that long since Alistair left Rebecca, and already... Well, good for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She masked her surprise and turned to Caroline with a polite smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hi, I'm Vivienne Everett, Alistair's..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She trailed off, unsure how to finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What do I even say? His ex-wife's former best friend? That's a mouthful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But "friend"? That doesn't feel right either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline smoothly picked up the conversation. "I've heard about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne glanced at Alistair, surprised and a little flattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't expected him to mention her to his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wondered how he'd described her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her mind, Alistair had always avoided anything related to Rebecca, so, for her, Rebecca's former best friend, this was unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you for standing up for my husband back then," Caroline added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne blinked, caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, he framed me as someone who helped him out? A good Samaritan, I guess. Not quite a savior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, it was nothing. I just said what needed to be said," Vivienne said, a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't like she'd done anything extraordinary. Rebecca had been so unreasonable, and Vivienne couldn't stand by and watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't expected Alistair to remember, let alone bring it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, remembering her great-aunt's matchmaking blunder&mdash;mistaking Alistair for her boyfriend&mdash;Vivienne turned to the confused old woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"See, Great-aunt? I told you he's not my boyfriend. He's married!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old woman sighed, "What a shame! But young man, you and your wife make such a handsome couple," she said, nodding at Alistair and Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That last comment softened Caroline's irritation toward the meddling woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair, ever the respectful younger generation, simply said, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old woman then noticed Eloise and said, "Oh my, what a beautiful little girl! Like a little fairy. You're going to grow up just as stunning as your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise beamed. "Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elderly woman turned to Vivienne, her tone earnest. "See, Vivienne? They're about your age, and their daughter's already so big. You need to get moving! I know you young people don't like hearing this, but I'm just looking out for you. Money can wait, but good men won't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne rolled her eyes, speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back at their table, Caroline glanced at Alistair, then again a moment later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise, who had been sitting next to Caroline, now clung to Alistair's side, refusing to budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair was amused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The little one and the not-so-little one were so attached to him, one with her longing looks and the other with her constant presence. It was truly a sweet burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He threw up his hands in surrender. "This is an accident, I swear it's an accident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline took a sip of water, her tone light but teasing. "But it's true, my husband is quite the catch. I'm always worried someone might snatch him away when I'm not looking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise, too young to catch the humor, gasped and wrapped her arms around Alistair's leg. "Mommy, don't worry! You go to work, and I'll watch Daddy. I won't let anyone take him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline teased her, "But what about school?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise's face froze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, I forgot about that. School or Daddy... which is more important?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The little girl didn't hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Daddy, of course! Without Daddy, I'd be a kid from a single-parent family again, and Mommy wouldn't have a husband...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly added, "Then I won't go to school! I won't even sleep! I'll watch Daddy all day, follow him everywhere, and no one can take him away from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline feigned concern. "But what if someone tries really hard to take him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise clenched her tiny fists, her face serious. "Then I'll fight them!!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline laughed, gently pinching her daughter's cheek, "You're such a good girl. But don't worry, Mommy's here. No one's taking Daddy away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise wasn't entirely convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>First, there was that boy Daniel who wanted to steal her daddy, and now some random old lady was eyeing her mommy's husband. She couldn't shake her unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There are so many men in the world! Why does everyone want my daddy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's mine and Mommy's, and no one else can have him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her mind racing, Eloise suddenly thought of something else, her fear of losing her daddy pushing her to ask, "But what if Daddy wants to leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline glanced at Alistair, her tone playful but with a hint of seriousness. "Then Mommy will tie him up with a rope so he can never leave us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The conversation left Alistair both touched and amused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After dinner, as they went to pay, the cashier smiled politely and informed them their table had been chosen as the lucky customer of the day&mdash;their meal was on the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knew it was just an excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair didn't insist on paying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd once cooked a free birthday lunch for Vivienne's mom, and though she'd given him a gift in return, it seemed she still felt indebted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rain had stopped, and a cool breeze swept through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair hoisted Eloise onto his shoulders, Caroline linking her arm with his as they strolled leisurely toward home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eloise, clinging to Alistair's neck, asked innocently, "Daddy, what color rope do you like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair stifled a laugh at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The little one actually took Caroline's joke seriously and is now planning the details!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair pretended to think it over and said, "Pink, I guess."</span></p></div>
