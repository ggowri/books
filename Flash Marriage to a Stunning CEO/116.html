        <h1>Chapter 116 Stand Up</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's Alistair..." Rebecca whispered, her voice barely audible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel's eyes widened in shock. "Alistair is the one who bullied you? He's here at today's party?"</span><br><span>It was an exclusive, high-end event where ordinary people couldn't possibly gain entry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Rebecca hadn't accompanied him as his plus-one, even she wouldn't have qualified to attend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca explained, "The woman who is currently with Alistair is the one I am referring to. She has this intense hatred toward me. Her daughter used to attend the same preschool as Danny, and she encouraged her child to brag in front of Danny that Alistair was her new daddy now."</span><br><span>She paused, her voice trembling slightly. "Dad, you know how attached Danny is to Alistair. The kids got into a conflict at school, and the preschool called us parents in to resolve it. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That woman knew she was in the wrong, but instead of apologizing, she completely lost her temper and slapped me across the face&mdash;twice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had twisted the truth about her conflict with Caroline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As far as she was concerned, she had done nothing wrong&mdash;it was always everyone else's fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he had later struck Rebecca himself over matters involving Richard, before that incident, she had always been his precious daughter. The thought that someone would so openly mistreat her was infuriating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why didn't you tell me about this sooner? Although our family may not belong to the top-tier elites, we are definitely not the type that can be easily pushed around by just anyone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Rebecca spotted that detestable woman who made her blood boil walking out of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She immediately flung open the car door and stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment's thought, she grabbed her half-finished cup of coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stormed toward Caroline with fury in every step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There had been too many powerful figures at the venue earlier&mdash;any disturbance would have instantly become the center of attention and affected her family's reputation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't dared confront Caroline there. But out here, with Nathaniel backing her up, she had far fewer reservations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel quickly got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca had been wronged, and how could he, as her father, stand idly by? He was determined to seek justice for her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline stopped by the designer outlet store next to the restaurant, calmly watching as Rebecca stormed toward her with fury in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She anticipated Rebecca's next move perfectly, gracefully dodging as Rebecca attempted to throw hot coffee at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a splash, Rebecca immediately raised her wrist for another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last time, this woman had slapped her twice across the face. This time, she intended to return the favor with interest&mdash;at least four slaps to settle the score!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline predicted her actions with precision once again, catching Rebecca's wrist mid-swing and then flinging it backward. The momentum sent Rebecca stumbling backward like a leaf in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel, who had been following closely behind, caught her just in time to prevent her from falling in the middle of the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at Caroline with anger. "What kind of young lady resorts to violence at the slightest disagreement?"</span><br><span>Then he got a clear look at Caroline's face and froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that after Alistair divorced Rebecca, he had managed to "marry up" in status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deep down, he had always assumed that whoever Alistair had managed to snag would be, if not old and ugly, then certainly fat and unremarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, unless Alistair's passable looks had fooled them, why would someone of high standing be interested in him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the moment he saw Caroline, Nathan realized he had been completely mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline calmly brushed off non-existent dust from her clothes. "I suggest you direct those words at your daughter. If your eyes are working properly, you should have noticed she was the one who came at me first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned and pointed at the wet spot behind her. "If I hadn't moved quickly enough, all that water would have ended up on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel wasn't so sure anymore. "Rebecca, is she the one who was bullying you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was about to nod when the infuriating woman across from them said with a smile, "My daughter is five years old, and even she knows that running to parents at the first sign of trouble is childish behavior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rebecca was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Young lady, you really shouldn't be so arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline remained unmoved. "I'd give that same advice to your daughter. She's the one who's been arrogant toward me this entire time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel had no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being a generation older than her, all he wanted was to seek justice for Rebecca by talking things through reasonably, maybe lecturing the woman a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they started fighting, he could step in and take Rebecca's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't personally step forward and kick the woman. At his age and position, that would make him the bully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just standing by and watching made his blood boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel was furious. "Even if she was a bit emotional today, it's because you hit her before! This is a civilized society! No matter what, you should never resort to violence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline went straight for the jugular. "You think your daughter doesn't want to hit me? She simply doesn't have what it takes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These words successfully provoked Rebecca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lunged forward, ready to fight Caroline with everything she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel grabbed the enraged Rebecca, holding her back. "Rebecca, she's deliberately trying to provoke you. You're a well-bred young lady&mdash;don't stoop to the level of someone so crude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While saying this, he couldn't help but admit to himself that Caroline was skillful, breaking down Rebecca's composure with just a few words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In truth, if possible, he wished Rebecca could be as calculating and cunning as her opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, Dad promises to find a way to get even for you later. For now, stay calm and don't fall into her trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nathaniel didn't want to make a scene. He had important business today and didn't want to waste time with Caroline. More importantly, he feared that causing a commotion might leave a negative impression if the CEO of Vireon Technologies happened to witness it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car had barely stopped at the curb when someone rushed out from the back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alistair spotted Caroline from a distance, and a smile began to form on his lips. Then he suddenly realized she was facing Nathaniel and Rebecca!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation looked tense, like a standoff about to erupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without taking time to figure out what was happening, Alistair immediately jumped out of the car. In a few quick strides, he reached Caroline and smoothly positioned himself protectively in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caroline was momentarily startled&mdash;she knew he was coming but hadn't expected him to arrive so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was he that eager to see her?</span></p></div>
