  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne burst forth from the Eclipse Realm, blood spilling from his mouth as his energy waned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flickered across his face as he sprinted toward the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him, Anastasia and the others looked equally disheveled, struggling to keep pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, help us!" Osborne shouted, his voice echoing through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's expression hardened dramatically, her eyes widening in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively moved to rush toward him, only to be intercepted by Icy One and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Stay right where you are, God of Light! With us here, you won't have a chance to save them! Looks like they're on the brink!" Icy One taunted, his voice dripping with glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration surged within the God of Light, and she unleashed a flurry of attacks, but Icy One and his gang stood their ground, willing to take a few hits to keep her at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne realized the situation. He could see that the God of Light wouldn't be able to reach them in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick pivot, he changed direction and bolted toward another battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, save me! Mr. Jackson, Mr. Cullen, help us!" he cried out, his voice filled with desperation as he raced toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, three figures emerged from the Eclipse Realm&mdash;none other than Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They fixed their cold gazes on the fleeing group and smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thinking you can escape, are you?" Icy Six sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not getting away! No one can save you now!" Icy Seven added, his voice low and menacing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!" Icy Eight commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they began their slow pursuit, relishing the chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne dashed closer to the battlefield, where two thousand Supernal Deity Kings were engaged in fierce combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half of them belonged to Lord Malevolence's forces. Upon hearing Icy Six's orders, they abandoned their opponents and surged toward Osborne and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop them! Protect the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!" Jethro shouted, rallying the troops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hundred Supernal Deity Kings from the Hudson family charged forward, determined to rescue Osborne and the others. Simultaneously, three hundred from the Sanctum of Light joined the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner exchanged a glance with Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cullen, should we help them? Osborne has crossed you before," Tanner remarked, a hint of hesitation in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's brow furrowed, his jaw clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a moment, he let out a frustrated huff. "He may have wronged me, but that's our personal beef! Right now, it's about the Human Community versus the Paramount Supreme Clan! If the God of Light wants us to protect him, we can't just stand by and watch him die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner smirked. "Mr. Cullen, you're quite magnanimous. Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they joined the fray, charging into the chaos alongside the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield erupted into a whirlwind of conflict as Osborne and his group quickly reached Jethro and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you alright?" Jethro asked, concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he had an inkling of Osborne's plan, seeing him so bloodied and battered made Jethro's heart race with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I'm still breathing! But we're in pretty bad shape and need some time to recover! You have to protect us while we regroup!" Osborne replied, urgency in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne and the others sank to the ground, legs crossed, and pulled out white Miracle Elixirs, gulping them down in a desperate attempt to heal their wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This </span><span>situation</span><span> caused Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight to exchange worried glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six shouted, panic creeping into his voice, "Attack them! Don't let them recover! They're heavily injured and on the verge of collapse! A few Supernal Deity Kings could wipe them out! This is our best shot to finish them off! No matter the cost, we need to kill them now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Icy Six finished his command, a thousand Supernal Deity Kings under Lord Malevolence launched a frenzied assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Block them!" Jethro shouted, rallying the warriors from the Hudson family to form a protective barrier around Osborne and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly surrounded them, layer upon layer of defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, others banded together to fend off the relentless attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield erupted into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight held back, seemingly injured themselves, only directing the onslaught of their forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the thousand Supernal Deity Kings had the upper hand against the eight hundred from the Human Community, breaking through the defenses to harm Osborne and his companions&mdash;who were shielded by two hundred Supernal Deity Kings from the Hudson family&mdash;was proving impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration and rage bubbled within Icy Six and his allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them! Spare no effort!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed vigor, the Supernal Deity Kings under Lord Malevolence intensified their attacks, putting immense pressure on the defenders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors from the Hudson family, seeing the battle escalate, had no choice but to join the fray, pushing forward to assist in the defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, everyone was fighting tooth and nail, leaving only a handful of Supernal Deity Kings, including Jethro, to guard Osborne and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and the others, having consumed the white Miracle Elixir, were channeling all their energy into recovery. Though their breaths were still ragged, they seemed to be improving, albeit slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on, reaching a fever pitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more warriors were injured and forced to retreat and recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who fell back were not far from Osborne and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the wounded, one figure cast a furtive glance at Osborne, his eyes glinting with cold malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly signaled to others around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a fierce shout, "Kill!" dozens of injured warriors surged forward, their speed astonishing as they targeted Osborne and his companions, unleashing a barrage of attacks they had been preparing for ages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne and his group were engulfed in a wave of assaults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least fifty Supernal Deity Kings had coordinated their efforts, striking down on them without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything unfolded in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Supernal Deity Kings from the Human Community were caught completely off guard, unable to process the betrayal from within their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they reacted, it was too late. Osborne and his companions were overwhelmed by the devastating onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shockwaves rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! They're traitors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've betrayed the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've killed the Seven Young Deity Kings!" someone shouted, horror etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger flared among the remaining Supernal Deity Kings, their eyes blazing as they glared at the turncoats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reality sank in&mdash;the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A triumphant laugh rang out, cutting through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the traitors, witnessing the unguarded Osborne and his group being annihilated, wore a smug grin. "Sure, we've been exposed, but taking down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings will earn us a monumental victory for the Paramount Supreme Clan! It's all worth it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fools! The Human Community has been doomed for ages!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still fighting to protect them? How pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words ignited a firestorm of fury among the remaining Human Community warriors, their faces flushed with rage.</span></p><div class="pagination">
