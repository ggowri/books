  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an unfair gunfight, as the outcome had already been predetermined from the very beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there were seven members of the Hummingbird Gang and they all fired their guns at Osborne simultaneously, their bullets were destined to have no effect on him. Even if they hit him, they couldn't pierce through his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Clarissa could handle it easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne's bullets were like the curse of the god of death. Every bullet could hit them accurately. Even if they hid behind the cover, they could not escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne did not kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every bullet he fired accurately pierced their thighs, arms, shoulders, and other areas, rendering them immobilized. They could only lie on the ground, screaming and howling in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, all eight young men from the Hummingbird Gang fell down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the little girl was left, standing there with her eyes wide open and a look of horror on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good girl, come here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa waved to the little girl. The little girl hesitated for a moment, but still walked up to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa pulled her and said gently, "Don't be afraid! We are here to help you. From now on, they can no longer control you or force you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl was confused and looked frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only continue to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at the little girl, then looked at the members of the Hummingbird Gang lying on the ground wailing, and sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked up to a small leader, Jack White, and said coldly, "You are their leader, right? Call the boss of the Hummingbird Gang immediately and ask him to bring people over. It's best to bring everyone with him, and I'll be waiting for him here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack was stunned as he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "Didn't you understand what I said? Why don't you call your boss quickly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he fired another shot, hitting Jack in the thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack screamed, beads of sweat dripping down his face, and he quickly shouted, "I'll call right away! I'll call right away. Please don't shoot. Don't kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finished saying that, he tremblingly took out his phone and quickly started communicating with someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the call, Jack looked at Osborne in horror and said, "Our boss said he will come over immediately. Who are you? Do you have a grudge against the Hummingbird Gang? Why are you targeting us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Who am I? Don't worry about it. I have no grudge against the Hummingbird Gang. I just have a grudge against all evil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he ignored Jack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked around and couldn't help frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there was a shootout here, many people were still hiding inside shops to watch the excitement. After all, this was the busiest commercial street in </span><span>Pinchide</span><span> City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like I have to change the position!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne grabbed Jack by the collar and walked towards the end of the commercial street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the end of the commercial street was a large park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa held the little girl's hand and followed behind Osborne, quickly arriving at the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing finding a small forest, he threw Jack to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell your boss that I'm waiting for him here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jack didn't dare to talk any more nonsense and quickly called to tell the new location. After he hung up the phone, a cold murderous intent emerged in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Osborne as if he was looking at a dead person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't care and waited patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, loud rumbling noises of cars filled the air as at least hundreds of vehicles appeared from all directions, crazily crashing through the park's gates and rushing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, hundreds of vehicles of various types surrounded the grove where Osborne was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jack saw this situation, he was immediately excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared coldly at Osborne and sneered, "Bastard, you're done for. Our boss has already arrived with his men. You're doomed! If you know what's good for you, </span><span>release me immediately and kneel here to greet our boss. Maybe you'll have a slightly more painless death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Osborne smiled faintly, "Really? I'm looking forward to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he looked outside the grove, and saw a stretched luxury car finally stop. Dozens of men quickly surrounded it and carefully opened the car door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on, a stern middle-aged man walked down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a very powerful aura, and his eyes were as sharp as a hunting eagle. He looked towards the grove with murderous intent on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the boss of the Hummingbird Gang, Kevin Pluto!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Block this place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin ordered and strode towards the grove. Hundreds of members of the Hummingbird Gang surrounded him tightly inside. Each of them pulled out a pistol from their waist, full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Kevin saw Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood calmly in the middle of a grove, with Clarissa behind him. He shielded the little girl behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin frowned as he saw this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? You only have two people here? You dared to lay a hand on my subordinate, making me bring all my men here, and yet you didn't call for reinforcements? Were there only two of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin found it a little absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Aren't two people enough? Two people are enough to deal with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Kevin burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bastard, are you crazy? Do you want me to send you to a mental hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin said this, and his face turned gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand. "Kill them and hang them on the park gate! There are only two of them, and you asked me to go out in person. What a waste of my time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Kevin turned around and prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men beside him, receiving his order, raised their pistols with a grim smile, aimed at Osborne, and pulled the trigger instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, intensive gunfire rang out instantly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
