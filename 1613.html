  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne agree, Diana seemed genuinely happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't quite understand it. He mused, "What's so great about just setting a signal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it has something to do with her past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She awakened her earth elemental power at birth and was sent here by the Wild Flame Army. She's barely had any contact with the Human Community, and because of her identity, she's faced disdain and ridicule from the other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life must have been incredibly tough. So, just because I'm from the Human Community, she's looking out for me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She probably feels so lonely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts swirled in his mind, Osborne felt a wave of sympathy for Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed like a pet kept in a cage by the Wild Flame Army, existing solely to use her earth elemental power to mine Essence Crystals at Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she was human and seemingly cursed, she likely never had any friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at her with newfound compassion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I get the chance, I'll help her escape this cage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolution, Osborne began to survey their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley and the others were up ahead, moving at a cautious pace. They had already distanced themselves from the base, and the fog around them thickened. Normally, </span><span>even with their Celestial Deity-level powers, they could only see a mile or two ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley and the team were becoming increasingly vigilant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They still had several thousand miles to go before reaching Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Osborne discreetly activated Satan's Eye. Instantly, the obstacles blocking his view became transparent, allowing him to see several thousand miles away to Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The towering, colossal Divine Peak Nine loomed like a massive continent suspended in mid-air, exuding an aura of mystery and eeriness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain his curiosity, Osborne asked, "Diana, have you ever been to Divine Peak Nine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her long stay at Divine Peak Nine, she likely knew more about it than most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied, "I've been there once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity King warrior brought a group of Deity Overlord warriors to protect us miners. They said they were looking for a Celestial Crystal mining area and wanted us to help extract the crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "What happened next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then... we were attacked by a massive army of </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. Nine Deity Overlord warriors were killed, and the Deity King was severely injured. Almost all the miners perished! No, wait&mdash;everyone except me died!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that, I never went back to Divine Peak Nine. They said I was cursed, and if I set foot on Divine Peak Nine again, it would incite its wrath and attract the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one wanted to go with me again, so I never returned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Diana suddenly looked up, as if trying to see Divine Peak Nine, though it was impossible for her to do so from this distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity King was injured?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nine Deity Overlord warriors died, and only Diana survived among the miners?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's no wonder people think she's cursed. If I were in their shoes, I'd think the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is like a walking death sentence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around her dies, but she keeps on living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What a strange situation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered for a moment before saying, "Tell me about your experiences mining Essence Crystals or any interesting or dangerous encounters you've had."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne would like to gather as much useful information as he could before they reached the 53rd mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, I'd love to share!" Diana replied enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana seemed genuinely happy at Osborne's interest. It was clear that no one had ever taken the time to chat with her like this before. As Osborne had suspected, she was incredibly lonely and longed for someone to talk to, to share her thoughts with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne initiating the conversation, she began to open up, her words flowing freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they knew it, she had fallen to the back of the group, walking side by side with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every now and then, she would glance at him, her face lighting up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours passed like this, and they encountered no unexpected dangers along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The calmness almost led Osborne to believe that the area around Divine Peak Nine was not as perilous as everyone had warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Riley and the others remaining on high alert, he might have started to doubt the presence of any formidable </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> lurking nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this time, he occasionally activated Satan's Eye to scan the surroundings, but he hadn't spotted a single </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two hours of continuous conversation, Diana suddenly spoke up, "We're almost there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked up through the thick fog and finally caught a glimpse of Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he didn't activate Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had reached the base of the massive, seemingly endless Divine Peak Nine, which was now less than 60 miles away.</span></p><div class="pagination">
