  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Augustine family were left scratching their heads, unsure of what Osborne was up to. But given his authority, they dutifully followed his orders. Before long, a portion of the Draco Group's satellites adjusted their orbits, positioning themselves over the various Divine Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screens flickered to life, displaying crisp satellite imagery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on, Osborne?" Sebastian asked as he strolled into the room, a frown etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce, Matthew, Wesson, and others soon joined him; their brows furrowed in confusion as they turned their attention to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne recounted the unfolding events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" The room erupted in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had led a team to Hearin City to fend off the Beast Tide, a situation they had monitored closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they discovered that the Blood Demon members had stabilized the chaotic tide, they shifted their focus back to their own training, honing their skills and refining their Divine Bone and Divine Flesh to break through their limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, they were completely unaware of the developments that had transpired in Hearin City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family has such a powerful background?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've awakened thirty-six divine ancestors? They actually want to rule Rosmandi and the world? Their first target is us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chill of realization crept down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian sighed heavily, saying, "Thank goodness for your quick thinking, Osborne. You've managed to redirect the threat onto the League of Divine Descent. If the Deschanel family is focused on them, we might just catch a break. Otherwise, we'd be in deep trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, he thought, "Grandpa, you're not entirely right. If the Deschanel family really set their sights on us, it wouldn't be too much of a hassle. All you'd need to do is reach out to 'Grandma Divine Shadow,' say a few flattering words, and maybe even charm her a bit. I bet she'd go to great lengths to help us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family might end up regretting it instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he kept this thought to himself. The dynamics between Sebastian and Grandma Divine Shadow were complicated, and as a younger member of the family, it wasn't his place to interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he couldn't shake the feeling that Divine Shadow's feelings toward Sebastian were anything but straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearing his throat to dispel his wandering thoughts, Osborne said, "Well, it seems like this was a stroke of luck. Let's focus on the battle between the Deschanel family and the League of Divine Descent for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family is indeed formidable, but I suspect the League of Divine Descent has its own tricks up its sleeve. The outcome of this conflict could reshape the entire world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne zoomed in on the satellite feed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The camera was fixated on a grand, ancient structure, a hallmark of Ransford's architecture, sprawling at the foot of Ransford's divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew this was the stronghold of the Byrd family, one of the thirty-six Divine Families in the League of Divine Descent, and ranked among the top ten in terms of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the charge against the Byrd family was none other than Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph, flanked by two Intermediate Deities from the Deschanel family, had already arrived in Ransford. He hovered in the air, his eyes locked on the Byrd family's residence, waiting for the signal from the other eleven teams to indicate they were in position and ready to launch their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's voice was cold as ice. "Kill them! Wipe them all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare they come to our Deschanel Estate and steal from us? We won't let a single one escape&mdash;level this place to the ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he surged into action, appearing above the Byrd family's residence like a blazing sun, his divine power radiating with an intensity that overshadowed the very sunlight itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Channeling his terrifying strength, he unleashed a colossal palm strike, which crashed down with the force of a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a sound reminiscent of the heavens crashing down filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground beneath the Byrd family's residence crumbled with terrifying force, as if the earth itself had split apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything in that vicinity&mdash;structures, and lives&mdash;was annihilated in Joseph's dreadful onslaught. The inhabitants didn't even have the time to scream; before the pain could register, they were wiped from existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The satellite feed captured the horror vividly&mdash;a massive, hand-shaped depression had formed where the Byrd family's estate once stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This colossal imprint was at least several dozen yards deep!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent tremors rippled through the earth, triggering a fierce earthquake that stirred the ground near Ransford's divine peak, leading to a violent volcanic eruption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in the conference room of the Augustine family, stunned silence enveloped everyone as they beheld the shocking images unfolding on the screens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really the power of a Superior Deity? With just one strike, he obliterated the Byrd family? A single blow caused the ground to sink dozens of yards across a radius of several miles! Anyone caught in that range&mdash;regardless of their capabilities&mdash;would have no chance of survival!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of the revelation struck them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each person present was gripped by a profound sense of foreboding. They couldn't help but ponder the implications. "What if Joseph's attack had been aimed at the Augustine family's territory in Newport City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought was chilling. The nine peaks of the Augustine family would crumble beneath such a force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few would escape unscathed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they were all safe within the Augustine Bastion, situated six miles underground. Even a Superior Deity would find it a challenge to root them out from such depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Unbelievable!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't just watch this on a monitor. It's not clear enough! I need to see this for myself!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
