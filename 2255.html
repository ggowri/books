  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the shouts of the Mystic Sirius Sect disciples rang in his ears, Osborne just nodded in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, it's time we hit the road," Angela said, suddenly showing up beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback and looked at her. "Ms. Olsen, you're coming with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled and replied, "Sure thing! You're my Peak Seven disciple, and now you're the champion representing the Mystic Sirius Sect in the upcoming city duel in Tempest Fortress City. I couldn't pass this up! So, I applied to be the team leader to guide you all there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and followed Angela towards the meeting point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm guessing you've gone through the materials I got for you. What do you reckon?" Angela asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "I don't really have a clear idea yet! It's just some basic stuff. Without seeing them in action, it's tough to tell how strong they really are. But no matter how tough they are, they won't stand in my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela arched an eyebrow, taken aback by his confidence. "Feeling pretty cocky, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled serenely, "It's just a city duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela went quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to remind him not to underestimate the competition, as there were bound to be some real powerhouses in the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she held her tongue and simply said, "Well, I'll be watching you perform!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they reached the assembly point. The top ten from the tournament, like Bethan and Jamar, were already waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing beside Angela was Danilo Wilkens, the Peak Lord of Peak One, who would also be accompanying them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is everyone here? If so, let's roll!" Danilo declared, waving his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A colossal warship materialized in the sky, emblazoned with a huge wolf-head insignia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All aboard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo was the first to leap onto the ship, quickly followed by Angela, Osborne, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Mystic Sirius Sect disciples cheered, the warship took off, hurtling eastward towards Azure Haven Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city duel was going to be held there because Marreese, the champion of last year's Tempest Fortress City duel, was from Azure Haven Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the ship, Bethan and Jamar were chatting animatedly, while Osborne sat on the edge, feeling a bit like an outsider among the other nine. He didn't know them well enough to jump into the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Bethan and Jamar walked over to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" they greeted him courteously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't just brush them off, so he nodded and looked at them curiously. "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you heard about Leroy and Clara?" Bethan asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Yeah, I've heard. They're dark horses from Azure Haven Academy and Fantasia Isle, and they're said to be really badass."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan concurred. "They're seriously strong! But if we're talking about dark horses, you're the real deal! Out of the thirty chosen from the three Second-rate Powers and the thirty-four from Third-rate Powers, a total of sixty-four will compete in the city duel. But you're the only one at Ascension Eight&mdash;everyone else is at Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan couldn't help but let out a wry chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just two weeks ago, it would've been unthinkable for them to be up against someone at Ascension Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they had to admit&mdash;Osborne was at least a couple of levels above them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they fought him a hundred times, they didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you've got what it takes to take home the win? I've heard there are already bets going around, and the odds of you winning are one in a hundred!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan and Jamar exchanged excited looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously? One in a hundred again? They really underestimate me, don't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, realizing this could be a golden opportunity to rake in a hefty sum of Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he understood why Bethan and Jamar had come to chat with him; they were probably looking to see how confident he felt, hoping to place bets on him and make a quick profit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile crept across Osborne's face; he didn't mind helping them earn some Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know, the arena is full of surprises, and these opponents are no joke. I can't guarantee a championship win! But getting into the top five&mdash;or even the top three&mdash;should be a walk in the park!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you guys want to bet, you can wager on me making the top three! The odds should be pretty decent. But if you're feeling lucky, you could always go for the championship win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do my best not to let you lose your money, but if it happens, don't blame me," he added with a wink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Bethan and Jamar looked taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying you have a hundred percent confidence in making it to the top three? Even a shot at winning it all? That's some serious self-assurance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with those enticing odds in mind, they exchanged determined glances and decided to take the plunge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan said, enthusiasm in her voice, "Thanks for the honesty, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll bet one hundred Sacred Crystals on you winning it all! And another hundred for you to snag a top-three finish! The odds for that are still one to fifteen, and if you make it, I could pocket over a thousand Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guess I'd better offer my congratulations in advance, then," Osborne said with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted amiably for a while longer before going their separate ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a seat, closing his eyes briefly to collect his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the warship started to decelerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo's voice boomed, cutting through the din in the cabin, "We've reached Azure Haven Academy! Everyone, keep in mind that once we're on their territory, we need to lie low and stay out of trouble. Azure Haven Academy is more powerful than Mystic Sirius Sect, and this is their turf. If any issues crop up, neither Ms. Olsen nor I may be able to bail you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" the group responded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with anticipation, Osborne craned his neck to look out of the ship. They had sailed into Azure Haven Academy, a sprawling and bustling place. Down below, millions of disciples were pointing and chattering about their arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, the warship touched down on the designated platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several high-ranking officials from Azure Haven Academy made their way over. It was obvious they were on familiar terms with Danilo and Angela, greeting them warmly and eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them said, "Come on! Let's go to your quarters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all should get a good night's rest. Tomorrow morning, we'll conduct the draw for the matches, and right after that, the city duel kicks off! Gear up and get ready to fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm looking forward to seeing each of you give it your all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela guided the ten disciples to their assigned lodgings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were going to stay here for the next seven days until the city duel wrapped up. There were also accommodations nearby for the competitors from Fantasia Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon their arrival, they ran into a group of Fantasia Isle's competitors emerging from their quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant they locked eyes with the Mystic Sirius Sect team, a fierce competitive spirit flared up among them. A wave of oppressive energy bore down on Osborne and his teammates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan and Jamar quickly exchanged glances. Their faces blanched as they instinctively tried to brace themselves against the overwhelming pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt as if they were staring into the eyes of a ravenous beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar hissed through gritted teeth, recognizing the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Tyson! The champion of the Fantasia Isle tournament and the runner-up from the last city duel!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
