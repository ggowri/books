  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the obviously surprised Toby and asked in confusion, "Is there a problem with me knowing about Primordial Energy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't tell me there's no Primordial Energy to exchange here? Looks like you're just bragging. You even said anything I can imagine can be exchanged here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Toby remained silent for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long while, Toby finally spoke, "I do have Primordial Energy available for exchange! But with your battle points, you can't afford it, not even close! Even just a single strand of Primordial Energy is far beyond what your battle points can cover!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was even more surprised upon hearing this. "Is Primordial Energy that precious?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course!" Toby said, "Primordial Energy can only be born in the Chaotic World! And it's incredibly rare. It's precisely because there's Primordial Energy in the Chaotic World that Primordial Creatures can come into existence!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With the explosion of the Chaotic World and the birth of the cosmos, Primordial Energy can no longer be created, and its quantity is limited. Even in the deepest parts of the universe, Primordial Energy is the most precious treasure!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you have enough Primordial Energy, it's even possible to transform an Acquired Creature into a Primordial Creature, achieving immortality. Even if the cosmos explodes, it can continue to exist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why Primordial Energy is extremely precious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he had enough Primordial Energy, it might even be possible to transform an Acquired Creature into a Primordial Creature, allowing it to survive even if the cosmos exploded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he had unexpectedly absorbed a strand of Primordial Energy earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was just a strand of Primordial Energy, its value is probably immeasurable!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "No wonder my strength far surpasses others at the same cultivation level! No wonder my physical toughness is even greater than Silicon-based Lifeforms at the same cultivation level..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was incredibly excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "How many battle points are needed to exchange for a strand of Primordial Energy? I need to set a goal for myself. Anyway, I'll come back here in the future and definitely earn more battle points. Sooner or later, I'll be able to exchange for Primordial Energy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby fell silent again for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then it said, "Primordial Energy cannot be exchanged with battle points; it requires medals! Ten billion medals can be exchanged for one strand of Primordial Energy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Medal?" Osborne wondered what a medal was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby explained, "In the first twenty-seven levels of the Celestial Spire, you can earn battle points after passing the trials! Clearing the first level gives you at least 100 battle points. Clearing the twenty-seventh level can earn you up to one trillion battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But from the twenty-eighth to the fifty-fourth level, the rewards for clearing will no longer be battle points but glory points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing the twenty-eighth level earns you at least 100 glory points! Clearing the fifty-fourth level can earn you up to one trillion glory points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And once you reach above the fifty-fourth level, the rewards change again; the reward will then be medals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing the fifty-fifth level rewards you with at least 100 medals. Clearing the eighty-first level can earn you up to one trillion medals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So if you want to exchange for Primordial Energy, you need to clear at least the seventy-second level, or even the eighty-first level, to possibly earn enough medals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing the seventy-second level, or even the eighty-first level, is the only way to earn enough medals to exchange for Primordial Energy?" Osborne repeated in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would be very difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And even if he could do it, it would probably be a long time from now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sighed, thinking he wouldn't be using Primordial Energy anytime soon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would only have a chance to exchange for Primordial Energy on his third entry into the Celestial Spire!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, he would at least be at the highest level of Imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Forget it. I won't consider Primordial Energy. Let me think about what else I can exchange for!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne still had over 1.4 trillion battle points at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "How about exchanging for another top-grade Imperial Artifact? But I&rsquo;m afraid I can only use a top-grade Imperial Artifact after becoming an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Imperial Artifacts are easy to obtain. I should exchange for something rare, like...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Battle skills?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. Although powerful battle skills are good, he felt that creating them himself would suit him better. His Solar Sacred Arrow and Warfare Blade Technique were self-created, allowing him to unleash his full potential.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!" Osborne suddenly thought of something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Toby, can I exchange for the construction method of a level five Cosmic Translocator here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the Racial Convergence Planet, there is at most the construction method for a level four Cosmic Translocator, which can only enable inter-galactic teleportation. However, a level five Cosmic Translocator allows teleportation between star clusters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "The construction method for a level five Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One hundred billion battle points can exchange for the full set!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said in surprise, "So expensive? One hundred billion battle points could buy twenty low-grade Imperial Artifacts!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne thought for a moment, then nodded and agreed, "Alright! Help me exchange it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you also have the construction method for a level six Cosmic Translocator?" Osborne asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "Of course! Ten trillion battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Forget it, I was just asking! Anyway, I'll come back next time if I get the chance, then I'll exchange it! After all, with my current strength, even if I learn how to build a level six Cosmic Translocator, I don't have the ability to actually construct it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My spatial power is still far too weak!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued thinking about what to exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly he asked, "Toby, can I exchange for life-extending medicine here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course!" Toby replied quickly, "A box of Supreme medicine that can extend life by ten thousand years costs one million battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to exchange life-extending medicine for his family. Their talents were average, especially his grandfather and Divine Shadow and others. Without a stroke of luck, they might find it hard to break through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their lifespans are limited!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had already reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness, with a very long lifespan. He didn&rsquo;t want to see his loved ones pass away before him one day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he believed it was very necessary to prepare some life-extending medicine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then exchange fifty boxes of medicine for me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne believed that fifty boxes of medicine should be enough. Extending his loved ones' lifespans was just a last resort; the most important thing was to enhance their potential and talent, allowing them to reach a higher cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Get me another fifty boxes of talent and potential-enhancing medicine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "That's also 10 billion battle points per box!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>10 trillion battle points spent just like that!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne still had 430 billion battle points left. At this point, he really didn't know what to exchange for, so he simply redeemed 10,000 drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One drop of Legendary Dragon Elixir only costs 10 million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All these add up to just 100 billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still had 330 billion battle points left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I'll exchange for some Supreme medicine to heal injuries!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne exchanged all the remaining 330 billion battle points for medicine to heal injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This medicine costs 10 billion per box. That&rsquo;s only 33 boxes in total.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, all the battle points Osborne earned had been exchanged for what he needed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could say he gained a lot!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Probably the countless beings across the entire Racial Convergence Planet combined aren't as wealthy as him alone!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he alone possesses dozens of Imperial Artifacts...</span></p><div class="pagination">
