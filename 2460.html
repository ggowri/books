  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's various achievements densely filled the entire sky at this moment, including Dark Mandala, the corpses of Abyssal Clan reaching Empyrean Sacredness, a large number of Bloody Ivies, Abyssal Snakes, Eaglebeak Moths' wings, and Tigerstripe Bees' stingers, with the most being Ice Beetles' corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was stunned by Brenda's achievements, even those who had acted alongside Brenda were left speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They only knew that Brenda had been assigned the most achievements, but they found it hard to calculate exactly how many. At this moment, when they saw it with their own eyes, they finally realized Brenda's achievements were far greater than they had imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, many people felt very jealous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These achievements could all be exchanged for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. Then, they could use them to redeem treasures in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How many achievements does Brenda have?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Ian was stunned. He rubbed his eyes, thinking he had seen it wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he turned to look at Gerald and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian's eyes were filled with doubt, as if he were asking Gerald whether Brenda's achievements were obtained on Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suspected Brenda cheated and that Skyearth Dominion had prepared many achievements for her in advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald gave a wry smile and quickly said, "General Ian Augustine, Brenda indeed earned these achievements through her own abilities, and she achieved them all on Abyssal Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Actually, the resources on Abyssal Planet are far more abundant than we previously assessed. Moreover, the appearance of the Magma Devourer caused most of the Native Creatures on Abyssal Planet to hunt down the contestants...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>That was why she gained the most!</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Ian's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are the resources on Abyssal Planet really that abundant? I did a patrol before, but I was only looking for the one who killed the Magma Devourer. I didn&rsquo;t notice. Unfortunately, I also didn&rsquo;t find the one who killed the Magma Devourer..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like we must seal off Abyssal Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The resources here must be developed gradually by the Glorious Divine Legion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Ian looked at Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're impressive, and your luck is great too. You obtained such a massive amount of resources. If I had known earlier that the resources on Abyssal Planet were so abundant, I wouldn't have had a zone duel with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, it's not too late for you to know now, and your achievements won't be taken back. They will all be converted into Kingdom Duel Scorepoints for you to use as you wish!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Ian finished speaking, Brenda breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda had truly been worried before that Ian might deny her achievements or even take them back after she gained so many.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Glorious Divine Legion discovered Abyssal Planet, and all the resources there originally belonged to them and the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Ian used this as a reason to take back the resources they obtained, Brenda would have no way to refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it seems now that Brenda was overthinking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's achievements are indeed numerous, but to the Glorious Divine Kingdom, they are nothing significant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom is wealthier than she could imagine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda smiled and said, "Thank you, General Ian Augustine. Now please help me with the statistics!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Ian smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian appeared calm on the surface, but he was actually a bit jealous of Brenda. Although he hadn't done a detailed count, his rough estimate already indicated that these resources were worth at least six to seven hundred million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda could use six to seven hundred million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to exchange for a decent Legendary Sacred Artifact in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is a Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Ian found it difficult to obtain a Legendary Sacred Artifact. The Legendary Sacred Artifact he was using now was a reward from Prince Brent back when he served as his guard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six to seven hundred million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were enough to tempt Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as a member of the royal family, Ian had to act indifferent, completely unfazed by six to seven hundred million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Ian quickly began calculating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dark Mandala, one Dimensional Bag can be exchanged for one million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. There are eight here, so you'll get eight million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Abyssal Clan's Empyrean Sacredness-level skeletons, five corpses in the primary stage, and two corpses in the mid stage, so in total..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Abyssal Snakes' poison gland..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bloody Ivies..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eaglebeak Moths' wings..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tigerstripe Bees' stingers..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ice Beetles' corpses..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian calculated while feeling jealous and envious of Brenda in his heart, but he still didn't dare to show it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the others watching were not as calm as him. They had already started exclaiming repeatedly, "Oh my god. There are so many!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's their total number? Has anyone figured it out?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just the Ice Beetles' corpses exceed 300,000? That's over 600 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adding the other achievements, the total is..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian took a deep breath and said, "Brenda, your total achievements have been converted into 820 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Ian announced the calculated number, everyone burst into loud chatter. Some envied her, others were jealous, but most admired her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the leaderboard in mid-air suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's name appeared at the top of the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda received 820 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second-ranked Dustin had only 64 million Scorepoints, not even a tenth of Brenda's score.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a gap is enough to make people feel hopeless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Dustin smiled bitterly, his eyes full of envy. He only regretted not asking his sect elders for a power-infused Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, he would also have a chance to achieve such accomplishments.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, 80% of Brenda's 820 million achievements were exchanged using Ice Beetles' corpses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda obtained so many Ice Beetles because she possessed a Legendary Sacred Artifact, the Ice Scepter. She could easily kill numerous Ice Beetles and take half of the loot for herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, it's all too late now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone felt that Brenda's achievements were ridiculously high, and her champion status was unshakable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the outskirts of Crescentia, on Racial Convergence Planet, billions of people were watching. At this moment, seeing Brenda achieve 820 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, they couldn't help but be dumbfounded and utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most people were incredibly envious of Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only the people from Skyearth Dominion had excited smiles on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, you will win the championship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, Mr. Clarke was right to give the Ice Scepter to Brenda. She can use 820 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to exchange for a Legendary Sacred Artifact from the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The championship belongs to Brenda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The championship belongs to Skyearth Dominion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the people in Skyearth Dominion couldn't help but shout loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! Aren't you celebrating too early?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are still three people whose achievements haven't been tallied yet! What if their achievements surpass Brenda's?" At this moment, someone at odds with Skyearth Dominion couldn't help but speak jealously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his words triggered a burst of laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people from Skyearth Dominion glanced at the speaker with a look of disdain on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you believe what you're saying?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person immediately fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, on Abyssal Planet, Brenda looked proud and smug. Facing everyone's envious, jealous, and even admiring gazes, she tried her best to appear calm, but she still couldn't hide the excitement and thrill in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she looked in Osborne's direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda sneered, "Osborne, are you desperate now? Do you still want to compete with me for the championship? Are you even worthy? You even said I wouldn't make it to the top three. Now, how will you stop me from entering the top three? How will you stop me from winning?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
