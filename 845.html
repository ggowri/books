  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's final burst of power was unleashed with reckless abandon. He was no longer mindful of the toll it was taking on his mental strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's mouthpart had penetrated deep into Osborne's body, draining his blood energy, but she was taken aback by the ferocity of his counterattacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Mosley didn't flinch. Her massive frame, enveloped in divine power, was bracing itself to withstand the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dissolving Light shot forth, striking Mosley directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elemental light should have been particularly effective against her evil form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne had pinned high hopes on it, he was quickly disillusioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dissolving Light could not pierce through the formidable divine power shielding Mosley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the severe injuries, Mosley's divine power was reduced to less than one ten-thousandth of its peak strength. Even this diminished divine energy was enough to repel Osborne's Dissolving Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light vanished, only to be replaced by the terrifying Thunder of Judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bolts of lightning crashed down, engulfing Mosley's colossal form with a thunderous, crackling noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's divine power defense fluctuated violently but remained unshattered, absorbing the full brunt of the thunderous assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of disdain appeared in Mosley's immense eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the space around Mosley began to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spatial Collapse was taking effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley sensed a hint of danger but made no effort to evade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She allowed the power of the collapse to envelop her vast body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The space disintegrated completely. Mosley remained at the core of the collapse, but as the dust settled, she emerged unscathed. Her divine defenses, however, were shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared in shock. Spatial Collapse was arguably his most potent attack, yet Mosley had withstood it at its core without any apparent injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left him in utter despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This is what being divine means?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is beyond terrifying! If Spatial Collapse can't touch her, what else do I have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel his blood energy being rapidly drained by Mosley's mouth part. He was growing weaker and more exhausted, unable to move at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his tongue again, fighting to stay conscious and avoid slipping into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refuse to believe I can't kill you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, fight me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne roared, activating Thunder Realm, Spatial Domain, and Spirit Realm all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder of Judgment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mental Shatter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he summoned all three realms, the massive drain on his mental energy nearly emptied his reserves, leaving his face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had no time to worry about that. With the realms in place, his attacks were even stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Mosley felt a bit of a threat this time, but she still didn't dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her divine power surged again, and a tremendous force erupted, instantly shattering all three of Osborne's realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, already drained to the brink, felt the backlash of his own power, his vision blurring with stars and his head throbbing painfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blood energy was completely depleted, leaving him unable to even spit out a drop of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his Realms had been shattered, Osborne's attack had already erupted, landing on Mosley. Even her divine power couldn't fully withstand it this time, leaving her severely wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her already battered body grew even more broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley let out a furious roar. "Ah! Damn little insect, still struggling even as you die? You're able to hurt me even on the brink of death? You will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hum filled the air as the suction force from Mosley's mouth part intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's blood energy was rapidly drained, and his vision started to fade to darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt he was on the verge of passing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how desperately Osborne bit his tongue, it was futile. His mental strength pool was depleted, leaving him unable to even use a basic power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blood energy drained away, and his body felt as frail as that of an eighty-year-old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how it ends?" Osborne murmured to himself, truly feeling the edge of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley, being a Dark Deity, was formidable even at a fraction of her full power. Osborne knew he was no match for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cast a final glance at Kendra and Yulissa, sighing deeply, "I'm sorry, I can't save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne slowly closed his eyes, and at that moment, all his blood energy was siphoned away by Mosley's terrifying mouth part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's eyes gleamed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, such a massive amount of blood energy! Once I digest this, I'll be able to break free! I am back!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
