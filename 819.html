  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sharp whistle of Marvin's palm slicing through the air was the last thing Osborne expected to hear before it struck his head with brutal force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Death loomed over Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, escape was beyond his reach.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sudden, crisp sound shattered the moment. Osborne braced for the end, yet to his astonishment, no pain came. His mind remained alert, and his body was intact.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was alive!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, didn't I tell you that if you ever faced troubles beyond your strength, all you had to do was call my name, and I would be there by your side?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why didn't you call for me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A voice, cold yet familiar, echoed in his ears.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne trembled, and his eyes flew open.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There, before him, stood Isa. She had positioned herself between him and Marvin. Her hand was outstretched, a barrier against Marvin's onslaught. Her figure, tall and flawless, was a wall of protection, deflecting every strike from Marvin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gasped with shock. He had never imagined that at the brink of death, Isa would appear, a guardian angel shielding him from harm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his relief was short-lived, replaced by a wave of concern.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa, why are you here? This place is perilous. He's an S-class Supreme Overlord warrior. Don't worry about me. You must leave at once!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He reached out to pull her back, but she stood firm, immovable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa snorted, "Do you doubt my ability to handle him? Is that why you didn't ask for my help?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her expression softened slightly as she spoke.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without warning, she launched a kick, striking Marvin with such force that he was sent hurtling backward, barely managing to steady himself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His glare was laced with disbelief and anger. "Who are you?" he spat through gritted teeth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's response was curt, "That's none of your concern. I'll deal with you later."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned her back on Marvin, facing Osborne. A smile graced her beautiful face as she reached out to gently caress his cheek.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You fool," she chided gently. "You'd rather face death than ask for my help. If I hadn't been nearby, you would have perished."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was dumbfounded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Isa had kicked Marvin away?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He drew in a sharp breath.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Remembering Isa's sudden rise to the top of the Godson Rankings, he figured out everything. The top ten on the Godson Rankings were rumored to possess the strength to challenge S-class Supreme Overlords and, under certain conditions, even defeat them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bryce, for example, wielded the Trident of Poseidon, making him unbeatable by ordinary S-class Supreme Overlords when fighting at sea, despite his seventh-place ranking.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa was ranked first.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With her power, repelling Marvin was no exaggeration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He grasped her hand. "Isa, why are you here? You must be careful. He's a Class S Supreme Overlord, after all. Let's leave now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa responded with a cold snort.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Leave? Absolutely not!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's an S-class Supreme Overlord, a formidable warrior, but he dared to attack you. How could I let him off so easily? Watch me teach him a lesson, and then I'll take you away."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned to face Marvin, who glared at her and demanded, "Who are you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa calmly replied, "You can call me Night."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Night?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin paused, shock registering on his face. "You're the one who topped the Godson Rankings?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa nodded. "Yes, that's me. I'll give you a chance. Kneel, apologize to him, beg for his forgiveness, compensate for his losses, and I might let you go. Otherwise, you might meet your end here today."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin erupted into laughter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How arrogant! Night, even if you stand at the pinnacle of the Godson Rankings, what of it? You're still at Class AAA. To think you could kill me? You're not worthy enough!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll see for myself if you're qualified to hold the top spot on the Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Marvin lunged forward to attack Isa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A steely glint sparked in Isa's eyes as she turned to Osborne with an icy calm. "Pay close attention. I'm going to show you how to battle an S-class Supreme Overlord. I'll teach you how to harness the might of Class AAA to topple an S-class Supreme Overlord!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Actually, it's not that difficult!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No sooner had the words left her lips than Marvin materialized before her as he unleashed a formidable strike aimed directly at her head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's heart leaped into his throat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cry of warning escaped his lips, "Isa, watch out!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could finish, he watched in awe as Isa, with a casual flick of her leg, not only shattered the incoming assault but sent Marvin flying backward with a kick to the chest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin hit the ground hard, a spray of blood painting the air. His face was a mask of agony, and his chest heaved as he tried to contain the pain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fragments of what might have been internal organs mingled with the crimson liquid.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Weak! Pathetically so!" Isa remarked coolly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at Marvin with disdain as if she were looking at nothing more than refuse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment hung heavy in the air as Marvin's shock mirrored Osborne's own.</p><div class="pagination">
