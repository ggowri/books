  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face was a canvas of emotion, painted with gratitude and relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she had been deeply focused on her breakthrough, she was acutely aware of the chaos surrounding her. She knew that it was Osborne who had come to her rescue just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without him, Diana would have been overwhelmed by those formidable Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those were no ordinary foes&mdash;Deity Overlord late-stage Deathborn, along with two mid-stage and a dozen early-stage ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they had appeared, she had felt certain that her time was up. In the midst of her critical breakthrough, she was utterly unable to pull back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What happened next left Diana in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley and his team had fought tooth and nail to protect her, sacrificing two of their own in the process. Just when Riley was about to be overrun, Osborne had appeared like a savior, vanquishing all the Deathborn in a dazzling display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're friends; no need to be so formal! Congratulations on breaking through to Deity Overlord! Your speed is the fastest I've ever seen," Osborne said with a warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana looked a bit dazed. "I don't know why, but when I got close to Divine Peak Nine, my rate of absorbing Essence Crystals skyrocketed. It was astonishing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is it related to Divine Peak Nine?" Osborne asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded earnestly. "It must be! Before this, I absorbed Essence Crystals quickly, but nothing like this. It's almost as if..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hesitated, a hint of uncertainty flickering across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Almost as if what?" Osborne prompted gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Almost as if, after my breakthrough, I suddenly felt this overwhelming urge to go to Divine Peak Nine! It feels familiar, like something there is calling out to me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait, you really feel something calling you from Divine Peak Nine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes! It's so clear I can't be mistaken! But at the same time, I sense danger. There's something in Divine Peak Nine that not only beckons me but also poses a serious threat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne fell silent, contemplating her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, he said, "Diana, there's definitely a secret about you, possibly tied to Divine Peak Nine. But for now, you shouldn't go there. Let's wait until we're stronger, and I can protect you properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then we might uncover what's really calling you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana agreed, her expression resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After gathering their things, they prepared to head back to their base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pulled out a Dimensional Bag and handed it to Diana. "Here, Diana. This bag has some Ultimate Essence Crystals&mdash;enough for you to complete your mission. Keep the rest for your training; you need to elevate your power as quickly as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana opened the Dimensional Bag, her eyes widening in disbelief at the sight of over a thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if she worked around the clock, it would take her at least a month or two to gather that many, and even then, she'd have to turn them all in. There was no way she could keep any for herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is there so much?" Diana exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hesitated, then took out ten Essence Crystals from the bag and handed it back to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you should take this back. I can't accept it! Ten Essence Crystals are more than enough for my mission. As for the rest, it won't do me any good. They'll search my Dimensional Bag when I return and make sure I haven't stashed anything away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned at Diana's words. "They're actually going to search you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought for a moment before continuing, "Alright, once we get back to the base, I'll find a way to get you some Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With your talent, we can't afford to let it go to waste. You need to elevate your power quickly! We're heading to Divine Peak Nine soon, and you know better than I do just how dangerous it is up there&mdash;you need to be stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry about the Ultimate Essence Crystals; I have plenty to spare. You'll have enough to last a long while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt her eyes welling up with emotion at his kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a brief hesitation, she nodded, touched. "Osborne, thank you! You're the first person who's ever treated me this well. I won't let you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled softly but didn't say much more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's get moving. We need to head back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to the others. "Riley, I'm not going to heal your injuries just yet. With those wounds, you'll have a better story to explain to the Huntington family about Emmett's death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley and the others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given that the entire Celestial Deity team had been wiped out, only the three of them, all Deity Overlords, were left standing&mdash;albeit bruised and battered. Even the Huntington family would likely assume Emmett had fallen to the Deathborn and wouldn't place any blame on Riley for not being able to safeguard him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, they departed from the 53rd mining area, fortunate that no further incidents occurred along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon returning to the base, Diana was quickly escorted away, while Osborne and Riley broke off into their own paths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, Osborne found himself face-to-face with Athena, who wore a gloomy expression.</span></p><div class="pagination">
