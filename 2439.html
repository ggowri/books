  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum's words made Osborne widen his eyes in surprise again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Are those Ice Beetles outside all Drum's pets?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Are all those Ice Beetles at Empyrean Sacredness raised by Drum? Drum actually said that although they're weak, they're very obedient?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those Ice Beetles are all at Empyrean Sacredness. How could they be weak? Even the current Osborne would struggle to deal with an Ice Beetle at Empyrean Sacredness. If they attacked Osborne together, escaping would be nearly impossible for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Drum actually said they are weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Drum is Empress Kira's daughter. Empress Kira was once the strongest Master in the cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Drum's words are quite normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said with some delight, "Drum, are they really all raised by you? Do they all follow your orders? Will they do whatever you tell them to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum nodded firmly. "Yes. They are very obedient. Unfortunately, they are too weak. Over the years, I used the horn to purify their bodies. Although I made some of them a bit stronger, turning them into Silver Beetles, they are still very weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But it'll be easier from now on. I have a dad now. Dad, I can draw strength from you in the future, then purify their bodies more often, allowing more Ice Beetles to evolve into Silver Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eventually, I can even make them evolve from Silver Beetles into Golden Beetles. Once they all evolve into Golden Beetles, their strength will be quite impressive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally understood why there were thousands of Ice Beetles, or rather Silver Beetles, at the level of Empyrean Sacredness here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Drum used the horn to purify the bodies of these Ice Beetles, they were able to evolve into Silver Beetles and break through the limits of their species.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Drum, she can help purify the Ice Beetles' bodies more frequently in the future, allowing more Ice Beetles to break through their species' limits, reach Empyrean Sacredness, and evolve into Silver Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She can even make Silver Beetles evolve into Golden Beetles in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne swallowed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could Golden Beetles be stronger than warriors at Empyrean Sacredness?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he felt immense joy. Although Drum was still in her infancy and couldn't help him directly, the Silver Beetles she raised were a tremendous help to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thousands of Silver Beetles at Empyrean Sacredness could easily destroy an ordinary Second-rate Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, how should I take them with me?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum replied, "It's simple. Just take this Dimensional Microcosm with you. This Dimensional Microcosm was a gift from my mom. Once we leave, I can put it away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, I can play inside, and you can come find me anytime."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very happy, thinking, "So this Dimensional Microcosm belongs to Drum."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The space within this Dimensional Microcosm is incredibly vast, containing at least tens of millions of Ice Beetles, thousands of Silver Beetles at Empyrean Sacredness, and numerous Ethereal Blooms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gained a lot this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's a pity that since these Ice Beetles are Drum's pets, I can't kill them to exchange for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. This way, I'll lose a lot of Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Drum's voice sounded. "Dad, do you need Ice Beetle corpses to exchange for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned, forgetting that Drum could hear his thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded and said, "Yes. But since they are your pets, I won't kill them. Let them keep playing with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum smiled and said, "You don't need to kill them. They will die naturally. If I don't help purify their bodies, they will naturally die when the time comes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, there are actually many of their corpses here. To me, these corpses are useless, so I buried them all. Dad, since you need them, you can take care of them for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Drum waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne saw a distant snow mountain split open, revealing a massive pit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive pit was filled with Ice Beetle corpses. These bodies were frozen and perfectly preserved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned, thinking, "The Ice Beetle corpses actually filled up a massive pit. The number is overwhelming, at least several million or even tens of millions of Ice Beetles."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know exactly how many Ice Beetle corpses there were, but he knew he was about to strike it rich this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but hug Drum and plant a kiss on her cheek. "Drum, you've been a huge help to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne used the ocular energy of Satan's Eye to collect all the Ice Beetle corpses from the massive pit into Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After quickly doing the math, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There are 15 million Ice Beetle corpses. One Ice Beetle can be exchanged for 2,000 Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. If all of these are converted into Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, that's 30 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. Thirty billion?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. The harvest this time was so massive that he couldn't help but swallow hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kingdom Duel Scorepoints and Sacred Crystal are almost exchanged at a 1:1 ratio, with Kingdom Duel Scorepoints being even more valuable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne is willing to sell 30 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to other major forces, even if he asks for 40 billion Sacred Crystals, someone would pay.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne would never sell Kingdom Duel Scorepoints because he needs them to exchange for what he wants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, according to the distribution rules, 40% of these Ice Beetles belong to Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No matter what, I&rsquo;m definitely going to be the champion. Although the zone duel had issues from the start, it turned out to be a good thing for me. My gains are enormous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I first collected 3,000 Beast Soul Flowers, then obtained over 10,000 branches of Primordial Phoenix Sycamore and a pile of Radiant Fire Crystals in the Magma Devourer&rsquo;s nest. After that, I also acquired a mysterious transparent coffin and the Wingless Angel inside it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, in the deepest part of the magma pool, I obtained the Astralwreck Dragon Egg and hatched a mutated Astralwreck Dragon, Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, I&rsquo;ve also obtained the Drum of Empress Kira, becoming the Drum&rsquo;s father, and gained thousands of Silver Beetles at Empyrean Sacredness, over ten million Ice Beetles, and more than ten million Ice Beetle corpses."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Osborne felt that his gains in this zone duel were a bit outrageous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be that I&rsquo;m truly favored by the heavens, so all the good things came my way? In this zone duel, I&rsquo;ve perfectly accomplished all my goals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No! The Magma Devourer hasn&rsquo;t been killed yet. Once it&rsquo;s defeated, the zone duel can end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's eyes were filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can leave here now." After speaking, Osborne turned to look at the bewildered Primordial and Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They couldn&rsquo;t see Drum at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, when Drum was in her juvenile stage, no creature could see her unless she wanted them to.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Primordial and Flash couldn&rsquo;t see what was happening here at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t explain, he just waved at them and said, "Let&rsquo;s go out."</span></p><div class="pagination">
