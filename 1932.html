  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of unease settled in Osborne's heart as he pondered the implications of his situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really hope that World Tree offshoot takes down the Shadow Terror Fiend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he watched as Primordial's massive form began to shrink rapidly, transforming in the blink of an eye into a petite sapling that radiated a brilliant green light, shimmering like a finely carved gemstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Primordial dove into Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening roar filled his head, and Osborne felt Primordial enter his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden hues of his Soul Current Ocean were instantly illuminated by a vibrant green glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, he didn't feel any discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With confidence, he observed Primordial, eager to see how the fusion would unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that Primordial seemed incredibly excited. Its roots trembled vigorously, and every leaf quivered, casting a green light that made Osborne's Soul Current Ocean ripple gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, an overwhelming sense of pleasure washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This feels amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial settled in the center of Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, its dense roots plunging deep into the waters, creating massive waves that surged around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne still felt no discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he sensed his Soul Current Ocean becoming incredibly solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to describe his Soul Current Ocean as a house for his soul, it had once been built from dirt&mdash;more robust than the average person's but still limited in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Primordial's roots anchoring themselves, it felt as if steel reinforcements had been added, transforming his earthen dwelling into a concrete fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The solidity had increased by dozens, if not hundreds, of times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this one of the perks of merging with Primordial? With this, I won't have to worry about soul attacks anymore! Even a Supernal Deity King specializing in soul power won't be able to breach my Soul Current Ocean or harm my soul! My Soul Current Ocean is as solid as a rock!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His spirits soared, but then he felt something strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Primordial had established its roots, he noticed his soul power being drawn into Primordial's trunk at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, his Soul Current Ocean was completely drained of its soul power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial swallowed all my soul power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to react, Primordial's voice echoed in his mind, "Don't panic! This is part of the fusion process, and it's beneficial for you! I won't harm your Soul Current Ocean or your soul. Just trust me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitant but willing to give it a chance, Osborne paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, he soon noticed that after being absorbed into Primordial's trunk, his soul power reemerged from its leaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, it was purer and more potent than before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial had become like a massive soul power purifier, enhancing the purity of his soul power through its absorption and even increasing the quantity slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne sensed that Primordial's trunk seemed to grow a bit larger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this a win-win situation?" he mused, feeling the changes in his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, it dawned on him why Primordial was eager to merge with him&mdash;his soul power appeared to be something special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Primordial, this World Tree offshoot, the effects of absorbing Osborne's soul power were nothing short of extraordinary. It was growing at a visible pace, almost second by second, becoming stronger with each moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne wasn't losing out either. He was reaping benefits from Primordial's growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul power, which had already glimmered with a soft golden hue, transformed into a richer gold with a hint of green after being purified by Primordial's essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the strength surging within him automatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This enhancement continued with every bit of soul power Primordial absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has the fusion been completed?" Osborne murmured, a mix of hope and curiosity in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied, its voice steady, "Not yet! I've only just begun to emerge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My current strength is still too weak to complete the full fusion. I need your soul power to continue growing for a while longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I can offer you more benefits right now! For instance, I can use my World Force to cleanse your Divine Body, pushing it beyond its limits and granting you even greater power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced at the prospect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Breaking through the limits of my Divine Body? Does that mean I could reach Level Eleven?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath caught in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's tone remained calm. "Level Eleven Divine Body? No! The highest level is Ten! Level Ten is already the pinnacle. Breaking that barrier means... Infinite Sacred Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this vast cosmos, only beings with an Infinite Sacred Body can traverse freely! Otherwise, there's a significant danger. Without it, being struck by the various energy flows in the cosmos could be catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, I will help you achieve the Infinite Sacred Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yours will be unique, infused with a touch of World Force! If you later merge with that fragment of the World Tree's root, you will possess the complete World Force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that point, you'll truly be formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a single punch, you could shatter a planet&mdash;or even a star! The entire cosmos will tremble at your might!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, dumbfounded. "Infinite Sacred Body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never even heard of such a thing before. He always believed that reaching Level Ten was the peak of Celestara, thinking only by leaving Celestara could one break through that limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Primordial was telling him that surpassing Level Ten meant attaining the Infinite Sacred Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Infinite Sacred Body infused with a touch of World Force?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show me what you've got!" Osborne said, determination in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As you wish!" Primordial responded, and in an instant, its massive trunk began to shake once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaves, vibrant and green, detached from its branches, transforming into streams of energy that swiftly merged into Osborne's Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt his Divine Body stiffen, and an overwhelming surge of power began to wash over him, flooding his very being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" he couldn't help but cry out in agony, biting down hard on his lip as his body trembled from the intensity of the experience.</span></p><div class="pagination">
