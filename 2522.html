  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a fierce battle was unfolding in the distance, with one side being the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nearly thirty mid-to-high-ranking members of the Frenetic Storm Warband had all entered the Phantomagic Realm. Among them was the leader, Hamilton Lester, at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, two deputy leaders at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, and twelve other warriors also at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. The Frenetic Storm Warband's strength was already considered formidable among many forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ordinary organizations wouldn't dare provoke them, but the people fighting them now were even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were only three people fighting them, but all three were at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them held off Hamilton, while the other two were battling the twelve advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors and over a dozen mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors from the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if the Frenetic Storm Warband fought those three together, they were no match for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, several warriors from the Frenetic Storm Warband were killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, even if the Frenetic Storm Warband doesn't all die here, few will likely make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was not the outcome Osborne wanted to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pondered, thinking, "Is this fight over the Dragon Elixir again? Should I step in now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These past two days, the entire Phantomagic Realm has been in chaos. Anyone with great power has been relentlessly hunting others, seizing their Dragon Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had witnessed too many battles and thought, "It seems the Frenetic Storm Warband has also been targeted by stronger forces because of the Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne doesn't intervene, all the warriors of the Frenetic Storm Warband will be slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, if he steps in now, with his and Flash's strength, they could easily help the Frenetic Storm Warband turn the tide. Even if they can't kill those three warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, they can still defeat them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this way, too many people in the Frenetic Storm Warband would survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the situation changes later, Osborne and Flash might not be their match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't act for now. Let these three at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection help me kill a few more from the Frenetic Storm Warband. Otherwise, with my and Flash's strength, I might not be able to control the entire Frenetic Storm Warband." Thinking this, Osborne patiently watched from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, he could only see the distant battle through Satan's Eye but couldn't hear any sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hamilton&zwnj; seemed to be negotiating with their opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If only I could hear what they're saying," Osborne murmured, then immediately thought of Drum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum is currently in her juvenile phase. Although she has no combat ability, other creatures can't detect her or attack her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This means Drum is practically a perfect war correspondent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly summoned Drum and said, "Drum, go over and see why they're in conflict."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne shared the idea with Drum, Drum instantly became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For her, this is something really fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Drum disappeared from the spot and arrived at the combat zone. Through the connection with Drum, Osborne learned about the situation of both sides in the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man snorted coldly, "Hamilton, hand over the Dragon Elixir you have. Otherwise, every member of the Frenetic Storm Warband will die here today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Hamilton was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They really are fighting over the Dragon Elixir," Osborne chuckled, thinking, "It seems they know each other. In that case, I can't reveal myself easily. Otherwise, the strong Demon Dragon aura on me might make them stop fighting and join forces against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne decided to continue watching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hamilton snorted coldly and said, "Trenton Lykos, the Frenetic Storm Warband has never offended the Wolfen Trinity Guild. Yet now you want to steal my Dragon Elixir. Do you really think I'm afraid of the Wolfen Trinity Guild?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trenton laughed loudly and said, "It seems you're unwilling to hand over the Dragon Elixir. In that case, we'll have to take it by force. Unfortunately, your subordinates will all be killed by us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hamilton's expression grew even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at another battlefield and saw Wolfen Trinity Guild's other two leaders, Dominic Lykos and Ronald Lykos, slaughtering his subordinates. These people were his trusted aides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If any one of these people died, Hamilton would feel heartbroken. But now, at least five or six of his subordinates had already been killed. This made him incredibly angry, yet he was helpless because they truly couldn't defeat the Wolfen Trinity Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Do I really have no choice but to obediently hand over the hard-earned and seized Dragon Elixir to the Wolfen Trinity Guild?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking this, Hamilton felt deeply unwilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "But this seems to be the only choice. If I do this, my subordinates and I can at least survive. Besides, we'll still have time to seize other organizations' Dragon Elixirs. In the end, we'll still gain something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Hamilton was ready to give up and shouted, "If we give you the Dragon Elixir, will you let us go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trenton smiled and said, "Of course. We're old friends after all. Plus, we both belong to the Stellar Exploration Organization. I don't want to create an irreconcilable grudge with you. We just want the Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hamilton obviously didn&rsquo;t believe Trenton&rsquo;s words, but he had no choice. Gritting his teeth hard, he took out a dozen jadeflare vials filled with Dragon Elixir from the Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A small portion was obtained by themselves, but most were seized from other small factions. Among them, there were thousands of drops of Low-grade Dragon Elixir, hundreds of drops of Mid-grade Dragon Elixir, and over a hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was even one drop of Legendary Dragon Elixir among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hamilton lowered his head, looking at these Dragon Elixirs, especially that one drop of Legendary Dragon Elixir, his eyes filled with reluctance, as these were treasures capable of boosting his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He entered the Phantomagic Realm with his subordinates to gather as much Dragon Elixir as possible. But now, the Dragon Elixirs they obtained were about to be taken away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he felt unwilling. But to save the lives of his subordinates, he could only throw a dozen jadeflare vials in Trenton's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Trenton, I hope you won't break your promise. Otherwise, I won't let you off no matter what. Even if all my men die, I will make the three of you pay," Hamilton said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ignoring Hamilton, Trenton looked excitedly at those dozen jadeflare vials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That drop of Legendary Dragon Elixir made him incredibly excited, even causing him to burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as he reached out to catch those dozen jadeflare vials, something unexpected suddenly happened on the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing Hamilton voluntarily hand over the Dragon Elixir to preserve his strength and both sides preparing to end the conflict, how could Osborne, watching from afar, do nothing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately gave Drum an order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those dozen jadeflare vials were still in the air, but Drum instantly rushed forward and directly stored all the jadeflare vials into the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Hamilton and Trenton's eyes, those dozen jadeflare vials seemed to vanish into the void out of thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Trenton's smile froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hamilton in the distance was also stunned. At this moment, their faces were filled with a look of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What about those Dragon Elixirs? Where did they go? How did they mysteriously vanish into the void?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two exchanged a glance. Immediately, anger flashed in Trenton's eyes. "Hamilton, how dare you trick me. Where did you hide the Dragon Elixirs?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
