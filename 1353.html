  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thousands of warriors trapped within the Dimensional Microcosm were all elite members of the Pantheon League, hailing from thirty-six different Divine Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could transform them all into the Blood Clan, it would significantly bolster his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In critical moments, he could siphon off their powers to enhance his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, once they became part of the Blood Clan, they would owe him their loyalty. He could even make them serve the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, it was a far better option than simply killing them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the members of the Hastings family&mdash;the ones who had tormented Osborne's parents&mdash;had to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they needed to suffer for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne let out a cold snort and unleashed a surge of power, which instantly split into multiple streams, each entering the bodies of the tortured few.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all collapsed to the ground, letting out blood-curdling screams as countless black spots erupted on their skin, as if something was writhing beneath it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrific sounds of their agony made it clear they were enduring unimaginable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me! Just kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, end my suffering!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors from the Hastings family writhed on the ground, frantically clawing at their Divine Bodies, carving deep gashes into their own flesh, even tearing away bits of their own skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, no matter how much they mutilated themselves, the pain remained relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his hand again, and a brilliant, holy light appeared above their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Light of Redemption!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't want them to die so easily; he wanted them to endure even longer. With the Light of Redemption, he healed their wounds, ensuring their suffering continued unabated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers stared, wide-eyed and trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear gripped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't previously demonstrated his overwhelming power by obliterating several Superior Deities, they would have bolted by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were terrified, fearing he might turn that same wrath on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This level of torment was worse than death itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Observing their fear, Osborne sneered. "Relax, I'm not a bloodthirsty killer! I'm here for revenge on behalf of my parents. Those who tortured them must pay tenfold, a hundredfold! As for you, you're not involved in my parents' suffering, so I won't kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective sigh of relief washed over the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's next words sent a fresh wave of tension through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, while you may not be directly tied to my parents' plight, you're still part of the Pantheon League. You have enmity with me and the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, while I won't kill you, I can't allow you to remain a threat to me or the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I'm giving you two choices!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, you can choose death! I'll personally send you to hell, and I promise it'll be quick&mdash;you won't feel a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across Osborne's face, and the fear in their eyes intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breaths quickened as they awaited his second option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, you can choose to submit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Submit to me; let me leave a control means on your bodies, and I will spare your lives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, make your choice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who choose death, take a few steps forward, and I'll send you straight to hell! Those who choose to submit, take a few steps back, relax your minds and bodies, and let me place my control means on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these words, Osborne smirked, his gaze mocking as he watched the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assembled warriors looked at each other, and almost without exception, they took quick steps backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one stepped forward because no one wanted to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they could survive, submitting to Osborne was a small price to pay. Letting Osborne leave his control means on their bodies was far preferable to meeting their end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, they all made the same decision&mdash;submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold laughter echoed through the air. He knew none of these people were submitting out of true loyalty; it was sheer fear of death that compelled them to temporarily submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given a chance, they would most certainly rebel against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that didn't matter. Once they chose to submit, they would never again have the opportunity&mdash;or even the thought&mdash;of rebelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne intended to transform them all into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well! You've all made the wise choice. Now, relax your bodies and souls. Anyone who dares to resist will be seen as unwilling to submit, and I will not hesitate to send them straight to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne began his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current power, transforming this group of unresisting individuals into Blood Clan members was a breeze. He simply needed to divide a single drop of his essence into over three thousand portions, each merging into their bodies, and it was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, everyone had been transformed into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fear in their eyes was replaced with unwavering loyalty as they looked upon Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Blood Ancestor!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
