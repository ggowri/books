  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This change is too drastic." Osborne hadn't expected that after Agatha invoked the power of the Dark Phoenix, the transformation would be this significant. Not only did she grow Dark Phoenix Wings, but even her Sacred Power and Sacred Artifact were influenced by the Dark Phoenix Bloodline, becoming much stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt this was going to be a bit troublesome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, I also fused with nine drops of Phoenix Blood and ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame. Can I be like Agatha too?" Osborne quickly asked Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop dreaming," Primordial said mockingly. "Her Dark Phoenix Bloodline has already awakened. Now, she can truly be considered a Dark Phoenix. As for you, you've merely ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame, just gaining a bit of the Dark Phoenix's power. How can you compare to her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt quite helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the noble, mysterious, and powerful Agatha at this moment and couldn't help feeling a bit envious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not to mention becoming stronger as a Dark Phoenix, just her appearance alone is enough to make people envious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha, already beautiful, was now exuding a mesmerizing beauty and nobility that made people hesitant to approach.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the entire Frost Peak City became lively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Agatha was a favorite to win, many Ember Phoenix Clan members had arrived in Frost Peak City to watch the competition. They wanted to witness Agatha winning the championship in the state duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when Agatha faced Osborne, they started to get nervous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially when Osborne drew his bowstring three times, each attack stronger than the last, repeatedly forcing Agatha to retreat, they became even more worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They worried Agatha might be defeated, but fortunately, Agatha blocked the attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, when Agatha's body began to change and Dark Phoenix Wings emerged, all Ember Phoenix Clan members, even those watching through projections, instantly felt a bloodline-based pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at Agatha and even felt an urge to salute her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone exclaimed in shock, "This is Dark Phoenix."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes," an Ember Phoenix Clan warrior said excitedly. "Agatha has awakened the Dark Phoenix Bloodline. The Dark Phoenix, long vanished from the cosmos, has reappeared. Ember Phoenix Clan is so fortunate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another Ember Phoenix Clan warrior agreed, "We must quickly inform the elders, tell them that the oldest, noblest, strongest, and most mysterious Dark Phoenix of the Ember Phoenix Clan has reappeared in this world."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Ember Phoenix Clan warriors were extremely excited, looking at Agatha's projection with overwhelming emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As their exclamations echoed, many warriors from other races suddenly had a change in expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is actually the Dark Phoenix. I never thought the long-extinct Dark Phoenix would reappear. I didn't expect the Dark Phoenix Bloodline to still exist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This woman will be the treasure of the Ember Phoenix Clan from now on. As long as she doesn't die prematurely, she will definitely become a core senior member of the Ember Phoenix Clan, and might even become the next leader of the Ember Phoenix Clan. She could also become a top warrior on the Racial Convergence Planet or even in the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I really envy her. Osborne is in trouble. Agatha's Dark Phoenix Bloodline has awakened, granting her the power of the Dark Phoenix. At the same cultivation level, Agatha now has no equal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even Apex Clans like the Sacred Dragon Clan or the Sacred Tiger Clan can't defeat a Dark Phoenix at the same level. Moreover, Osborne's cultivation level is slightly lower than Agatha's. Unless Osborne has some extraordinary, game-changing means, he is bound to lose."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was passionately discussing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all believed that after Agatha unleashed the power of the Dark Phoenix, Osborne had no chance of winning and would be easily defeated by Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, very few people still supported Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Angela, at this moment, looked extremely serious, sighed, and said, "Are we ultimately not enough?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is actually the Dark Phoenix. Osborne is really in trouble now. Even Celestial Progeny at the same cultivation level, or geniuses from the Sacred Dragon Clan or Sacred Tiger Clan, would fear the power of the Dark Phoenix and might not necessarily win."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne's luck is a bit bad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Angela bit her lip, feeling sorry for Osborne. With the powerful combat strength Osborne had shown earlier, if Agatha hadn't transformed into the Dark Phoenix, she might have been defeated by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne would become the champion of the state duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, after Agatha transformed into the Dark Phoenix, the scales of victory had already tipped in her favor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He doesn't necessarily have no chance." At this moment, a dignified voice echoed in Angela's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela stood up, an incredulous expression on her face. "Ms. Alba? Where are you? How did you get here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be nervous," Adriana's voice was calm. "I'm still far away. The appearance of the Dark Phoenix has been sensed by the top warriors of the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom and even the entire Racial Convergence Planet. So, I couldn't help but want to take a look."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's voice carried a hint of shock. "I never expected the one battling the Dark Phoenix to be Osborne."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She indeed thought highly of Osborne. She even told Angela that if Osborne could stand out in the state duel, she would make time to watch the match during the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she only thought Osborne had a chance to make it into the top ten of the state </span><span>duel</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne was now competing for the championship. This gave her a huge surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne's opponent was the Dark Phoenix, who had alarmed the top warriors of the entire Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, have the top warriors of the entire Racial Convergence Planet really been alarmed? Does Dark Phoenix truly have such a massive influence?" Angela was extremely shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana sneered, "Dark Phoenix's influence is greater than you imagine. Many people are happy about it, while many others are furious. They don't want Dark Phoenix to reappear. What's more, Dark Phoenix has now appeared on the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I guess someone will take action soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whether Dark Phoenix can survive or disappear right after appearing depends on the ability of the Ember Phoenix Clan on Racial Convergence Planet. If they can't protect Dark Phoenix, then Dark Phoenix will once again become history."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If they can protect Dark Phoenix well, then the warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan from the depths of the cosmos will personally appear to take Dark Phoenix away. By then, Dark Phoenix will be safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before long, the cosmos will once again witness a top-tier Dark Phoenix warrior whom even I must look up to."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's words left Angela utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She murmured, "Is there someone on Racial Convergence Planet trying to kill Dark Phoenix?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not Racial Convergence Planet," Adriana corrected her. "It's that many in the cosmos don't want Dark Phoenix to appear and wish to eliminate her before she grows strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, my strength isn't enough. If it were, I could save her and build a good relationship with Dark Phoenix. Maybe in the future, she could be of great help to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "Ms. Alba is the top warrior on Racial Convergence Planet. Yet she says her strength isn't enough to save Dark Phoenix. Just how powerful must the ones trying to kill Dark Phoenix be?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
