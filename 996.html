  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson, Roy, and the rest of the Lambert family stared at the edge of the dense, shadowy forest, their expressions a mix of confusion and uncertainty. The enemy was invisible, lurking just beyond their sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Osborne unleashed his fury that the reality of their situation became clear. In an instant, he took down several </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins, their bodies collapsing heavily to the ground as they broke free from their Stealth Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson and Roy finally caught sight of their adversaries, and shock washed over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wielded his super energy pistol like a sniper rifle, picking off assassins hundreds of yards away with deadly precision. They were momentarily frozen, awestruck by the display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly clicked for them how Osborne had managed to eliminate the fifty-odd </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> assassins that had previously surrounded the Lambert family so swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roy murmured, shaking his head in disbelief, "Impressive strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These young folks are terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced over at the younger generation of the Lambert family, a wry smile creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the youth that was frightening; it was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least the younger Lambert family fighters, even Rhett, were utterly useless in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to pull the trigger, systematically taking down one stealthy assassin after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he had eliminated ten Class AAA assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the remaining </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization operatives finally caught on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Our Stealth Art has been compromised!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge! Wipe out the Lambert family! If we fail, Mr. Kane and Mrs. Kane will have our heads!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, nearly a hundred </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins surged forward, abandoning all caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They raced toward the Lambert family with their speed incredible; in just a few breaths, they closed the gap of hundreds of yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fired again, managing to take down two more assassins, but the rest were already within striking distance, crashing through the water walls and sending ripples across the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!" Osborne roared, leading the charge as the Lambert family sprang into action, unleashing their attacks against the oncoming wave of assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night erupted into chaos as various attacks lit up the darkness, signaling the beginning of a bloody clash between the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization and the Lambert </span><span>family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly a thousand Lambert family members formed a makeshift battle line, their backs against the rocky mountain, strong fighters at the front and the vulnerable behind them, ready to defend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, Greyson, and Roy each took a flank, determined to minimize casualties among their kin. They opted for an aggressive strategy, aiming to push the assassins back before they could reach the heart of the Lambert family forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne landed a powerful punch, obliterating the fastest </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> assassin who dared to charge at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as one fell, more swarmed around him, eager to breach the line and attack the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a snort of contempt, Osborne declared, "Is this all you've got? Just Class AAA assassins? You'll need a lot more than that to take us down! You're all going to die here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated the Thunder Realm in an instant, enveloping all the approaching </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins within a radius of hundreds of yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least forty of them found themselves trapped inside the swirling maelstrom of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't just any killers; they were Class AAA, and Osborne knew his Thunder Realm wouldn't hold up for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, he unleashed a devastating assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder of Judgment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The skies roared as countless bolts of lightning came crashing down, turning the Thunder Realm into a scene straight out of an apocalypse. In his hands, Osborne wielded the Volt Hammer, channeling even more powerful bursts of electricity to strike at the panicking assassins within the Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams echoed through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The smell of burnt flesh filled the air, and with just one strike, Osborne had taken down over twenty Class AAA </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization killers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he could feel his Thunder Realm trembling violently, on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed on, calling down another barrage of Thunder of Judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he truly felt the advantages of his soul of powers merging with his physical form&mdash;his speed in launching attacks was astonishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most would have struggled to unleash a second wave in this situation, but Osborne wasn't just anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Thunder Realm began to crack and shatter, terrifying bolts of lightning sailed down once more, finishing off half of the remaining assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few who were left were heavily wounded and reeling from the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne drew his super energy pistol, methodically taking them down one by one, landing shot after shot with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, he had racked up more than fifty kills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathing a sigh of relief, Osborne quickly scanned his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, his expression hardened as his eyes widened in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lambert, there's a Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassin 30 feet to your left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice boomed, urgency lacing every syllable. Greyson's face paled immediately. He had been just about to finish off a Class AAA killer, but without a moment's hesitation, he rolled to his right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a gash appeared on his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't moved, that blade would have found its mark right on his neck.</span></p><div class="pagination">
