  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know about Fairy Moon Sect? That makes things easier. I won't have to explain it all over again," Angela said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pride was evident as she spoke about the sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked at Osborne, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't Fairy Moon Sect just a first-rate power? Why is Osborne so surprised&mdash;almost thrilled?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their curiosity, Osborne chuckled. "Fairy Moon Sect isn't just any First-rate Power; it's the top-tier one! There are over twenty First-rate Powers in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, but the Fairy Moon Sect holds the absolute number one spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even on the entire Racial Convergence Planet, Fairy Moon Sect ranks among the top five forces! Aside from </span><span>Evernight</span><span> Court, Glorious Divine Kingdom, and Phantom Commerce Guild, no one dares to claim they're stronger! Even the Royal Family of Glorious Divine Kingdom treats the Fairy Moon Sect with the utmost respect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, Fairy Moon Sect is my favorite force across the entire Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne concluded, leaving everyone in awe of the sect's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "If it were just about power, I wouldn't be this amazed! What I truly admire about Fairy Moon Sect is its high standards for recruiting disciples. It's not just about talent; character matters too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fairy Moon Sect possesses a special Sacred Artifact said to assess one's nature and integrity. Only those with good character can join and become official disciples!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who comes from the Fairy Moon Sect can be trusted to have solid morals! You won't find any truly wicked individuals among them! Plus, to become an official disciple, you must be at least at the Empyrean Sacredness level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, Ms. Olsen?" Osborne asked, turning to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela stared at him, surprised. "You know quite a bit! That's correct; to become an official disciple of the Fairy Moon Sect, you need to be at least Empyrean Sacredness and pass the test of the Fairy Moon's Divine Arbiter Mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only those with pure hearts can join. Those with ill intentions won't even set foot in Fairy Moon Sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then looked at Anastasia and the others. "Once you reach Empyrean Sacredness, I'll take you back to Fairy Moon Sect. As long as you pass the Divine Arbiter Mirror's test, you'll become official disciples!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three girls exchanged astonished glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, does that mean we aren't considered Fairy Moon Sect disciples yet?" Anastasia asked, her voice tinged with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela nodded. "Not yet! But I believe in you! Looking at you all, I'm confident you'll pass the Divine Arbiter Mirror's test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for achieving Empyrean Sacredness... with my guidance, you'll get there in no time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you'll officially join Fairy Moon Sect, and I can complete my training mission and return as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Angela was bubbling with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this training mission?" one of the girls asked, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela didn't hold back. "Every disciple of Fairy Moon Sect, after reaching a certain level of strength, must leave the sect and undergo training within various major forces for at least fifty years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During those fifty years, you must find at least two personal disciples to bring back to Fairy Moon Sect! The more exceptional your disciples are, the better your training mission will go, and the more rewards you'll earn from the sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, even for my own rewards... I'll do everything I can to teach you well! It's this generational passing down of knowledge that has helped Fairy Moon Sect grow stronger and maintain its status as the top First-rate Power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, everyone began to understand the weight of what Angela was sharing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Angela suddenly pulled out her communication terminal and smiled brightly, "Perfect timing! My fellow practitioners have just arrived! They're also out training and looking for talented personal disciples, but finding exceptional students isn't easy. I've really helped them out this time! I'll go meet them now, so just hang tight here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angela vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even Osborne noticed how she left; there wasn't a single ripple in the energy around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but be in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wow, she's a real powerhouse! With her kind of strength, if she decided to come after me, I'd be toast in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity on my side, I doubt I could bounce back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Osborne felt the pressure mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is the Racial Convergence Planet, a hotbed of top-notch experts. There are so many heavy-hitters here who could wipe me out without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm way out of my league. Maybe I should find a teacher?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head as he thought about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't so full of himself to think there was no one who could teach him; he just knew he had to find the right fit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, Diana, Hannah, Bryce... you guys need to step up your game! If you can catch the eye of someone from the Fairy Moon Sect and get taken on as their disciples, you'll have a major backer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if someone in the Glorious Divine Kingdom wants to cause trouble, they'll have second thoughts! Chances like this don't come around often, so don't let it go to waste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he talked, the four of them nodded eagerly, their eyes filled with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Osborne shifted his attention to Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and even Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys too! If the opportunity presents itself, I hope you can become part of the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The upcoming tasks could be perilous and might draw the attention of some big-time forces. By then, there's a high chance that I'll drag you all into trouble... If you're in the Fairy Moon Sect, I'll be a lot more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least they look after their disciples and will do whatever it takes to protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls knitted their brows, worry written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what about you? We don't want to be apart! We want to go wherever you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft laugh. "It's a different story for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I start my mission, not even Fairy Moon Sect can guarantee my safety. Joining them might just make things more complicated. They'd probably try to stop me from taking the risks I have to take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But those risks are a must for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I won't join the Fairy Moon Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you want to stay with me, and I'd love having you around. But that'd only slow you down. You've got amazing talent, even on the Racial Convergence Planet. Fairy Moon Sect is the perfect place for you to really shine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll only be able to give me a real hand once you're stronger. If you stay by my side... I hate to admit it, but you'll just be left in the dust while I push forward."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne finished, the girls' expressions grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, they knew he was right. Their talent was great, but they still couldn't hold a candle to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staying close to him meant missing out on the guidance they needed to develop. In a way, tagging along with him would hold them back more than help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls exchanged looks, understanding in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We get it! We'll do our best to get into the Fairy Moon Sect and become their disciples. We'll train hard to boost our cultivation levels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he heard their determination, a smile spread across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, four female figures appeared not far away, and the atmosphere crackled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Angela, back with her fellow practitioners!</span></p><div class="pagination">
