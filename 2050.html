  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of relief wash over him at the realization that he could use Miracle Elixirs to cover the entry fee. If he had arrived at Elf City only to find himself barred from entering, that would have been more than just embarrassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly reached into his Dimensional Bag and pulled out ten Miracle Elixirs, handing them over to the two Elf guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They accepted the elixirs with a nonchalant wave and tossed him a small stone tablet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your temporary residency permit! It's good for one year. If you don't renew it after that, you'll be sent back!" one of the guards stated flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne accepted the tablet with a nod, tucking it away securely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elf guard then pointed to a towering stone pillar beside them. "You can enter now! But since it's your first time in Elf City, you'd better read up on the rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you get into trouble with the Elf Race, don't expect anyone to come to your rescue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone pillar loomed above, covered in a dense array of intricate Elf inscriptions. To Osborne's astonishment, he found he could easily understand the meaning behind the symbols. It was nothing short of magical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he scanned the pillar, his brow furrowed in disbelief. "So many rules?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The regulations for Elf City were staggering&mdash;over 100 thousand entries covering every conceivable aspect of behavior. For instance, if one encountered a member of the Elf Royal Family, they were required to step aside, crouch down, and lower their heads, avoiding prolonged eye contact, or else risk being punished with ten lashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outsiders were forbidden from approaching the Elf royal castle or entering the Elf Temple without permission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer volume of restrictions made Osborne's head spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elf Race held such a high status in Elf City that all other beings were relegated to second-class citizen status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left a sour taste in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the guards said, "You'd better memorize all the rules of the Elf City! Otherwise, don't blame me for not warning you if you get penalized! Of course, if you don't want to remember them, that's fine too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you have enough power to resist the Elf City's Enforcement Team! And if you can become a distinguished guest of the Elf Royal Family, then these rules might as well not exist for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm afraid you don't have the qualifications for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the two Elf guards waved him off. "Go on, take your time learning the rules! Just don't disturb us, or you'll be violating Elf City Law Number 9926, which comes with a punishment of five lashes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, feeling utterly bemused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is coming to Elf City really the right decision? I'm certainly not here to be a </span><span>s</span><span>econd-class citizen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that he was here, there was no turning back. Osborne had to quickly memorize the rules and then figure out his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the dimensional portal flickered to life again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More travelers were arriving!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, he decided to wait and see who would come through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The portal pulsed with white light, and in the next instant, it opened wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Elf guards remained expressionless as they announced, "Three from the Human Community, Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, entry fee of ten thousand Celestial Crystals each!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they finished speaking, a Dimensional Bag appeared in their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following that, a young man and two young women stepped through the portal. They looked to be in their twenties, but after reaching the Supernal Deity King level, age was hard to gauge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their smooth movements as they handed over their Celestial Crystals, it was clear this wasn't their first trip to Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, they took a moment to glance around and spotted Osborne standing alone, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community?" one of the young women asked, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Yeah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio exchanged glances, smiles spreading across their faces. "What a coincidence! Are you from the Racial Convergence Planet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Racial Convergence Planet?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up, but he shook his head in response. "Nope."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not from Racial Convergence Planet? Then you must be from one of the nearby smaller planets?" The trio leaned in, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man stepped closer to Osborne, extending his hand with a friendly smile. "No matter what, all of us from the Human Community should stick together here in Elf City! I'm Jaden Dutt, and the</span><span>y</span><span> are my wife, Renata Cromwell, and my sister, Letitia Dutt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all from the Human Community Federation of Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook Jaden's hand, sensing no malice from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm from Celestara Planet. Name's Osborne Augustine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestara Planet..." Jaden frowned, clearly puzzled. "Can't say I've heard of it! Have you, honey? Letitia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Renata shook her head, while Letitia pondered for a moment before speaking up, "I remember there's a small life planet called Celestara, located about ten star points from Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden's face broke into a grin. "Smart girl, Letitia! You even remember a tiny planet like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning back to Osborne, Jaden continued, "So, Osborne, you seem to be studying the rules on that stone pillar. Is this your first time in Elf City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Yeah, it's my first time. I didn't expect there to be so many rules! And..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated, unsure if he should voice his concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden chuckled, "You were about to say that the rules in Elf City are pretty harsh for us non-Elf folks, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded again, relieved to have someone understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden shrugged. "What can you do? This is Elf City! The Elf Race reigns supreme here, under the rule of the Royal Family and the Elf Temple. We're lucky they even let us in. A few rules here and there are to be expected. You'll get used to it after a while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, "I hope so!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden said, his enthusiasm infectious, "Come on! Since we've crossed paths, it must be fate! I've been to Elf City many times, so I know my way around. If you don't mind, we can be your guides for a </span><span>while</span><span> and help you get familiar with the place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll point out the most important rules, so you don't have to memorize every single one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a response, Jaden eagerly pulled Osborne along, ready to dive into Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't really refuse his enthusiasm, so he nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the dimensional portal nearby started to shimmer with unusual activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, it's so busy today!" Osborne remarked, surprised by the influx of people heading to Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the portal flickered with a golden light, which was different from the white light he had seen on his arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden and his companions had also entered through a portal that glowed white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the golden glow was definitely something special!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Elf guards, who had been standing watch, suddenly looked alarmed. Their expressions shifted as they quickly opened the dimensional portal and bowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jaden and the others wore surprised looks at the sight of the golden light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This means... a member of the Elf Royal Family is returning to Elf City!" Jaden exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jaden then grabbed Osborne's arm and pulled him aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, whatever you do, don't say anything silly! Members of the Elf Royal Family hold an absolutely revered status in Elf City. If you offend them... well, let's just say it won't end well for you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
