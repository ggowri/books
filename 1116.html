  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's sincere apology struck a chord, softening Osborne's voice considerably; gone was the harshness that had defined it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, he couldn't rightly blame her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The desire to kill Gerardo was widespread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, Bryce, Ophelia, and all those who had suffered at the hands of the Aberrants each had their own reasons for wanting Gerardo dead, each aching to take matters into their own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gerardo had only one life to take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone were to be the one to end it, why should it be Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He loathed Gerardo fiercely, fueled by anger over the loss of his beloved Anastasia, who had fallen victim to Gerardo's cruelty. The thought of flaying him alive was a temptation; the desire to see him ground to nothing was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Ophelia held equal resentment toward Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Caldwell family had been decimated at his hands, and Osborne understood that if their roles were reversed, he, too, would have seized the chance to kill Gerardo without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hence, Ophelia was innocent in this regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If blame was to be cast, it should rest solely on Osborne for not arriving a moment sooner to intercept her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to get out of here; it's not safe," Osborne urged again, forcing back the tumult of fury and frustration welling inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stood there, dazed, staring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, his words were no longer ice-cold, no longer filled with that palpable distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warmth in his tone brought forth a flood of memories, whisking her back to a time before their divorce when Osborne spoke to her with gentleness and offered her warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Ophelia had initiated the divorce, he had morphed into someone remote and domineering, each word he spoke piercing her like a blade, causing her heartache and regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, something had shifted; he was finally speaking to her like a person again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That realization ignited a spark of emotion within Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes glistened with unshed tears as she bit her lip, saying, "No! I won't go! Osborne, let me stay by your side to make amends! I realize my mistakes&mdash;I truly do! You still love me, don't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, let me come back to you! I've changed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have nothing left; I don't want anything but to be with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't we go back to how it was? Back when I loved you fiercely, and you showed me kindness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia suddenly grasped his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fervent words left Osborne momentarily speechless. He had never imagined she would again plead for forgiveness and seek to return to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, he didn't pull away coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gently shook his head and replied calmly, "Ophelia, maybe you have changed&mdash;and maybe you've genuinely acknowledged your faults. But it's too late for us. When I signed that blood-stained divorce agreement, we sealed our fate. We can't go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you love isn't me; it's the power, the wealth, the strength I've gained. That's all it ever was for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, just go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne slowly withdrew his arm from her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stood frozen, tears brimming in her eyes as her body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not too late? We're still young; I don't believe it's over! I didn't fall for you just because you've become powerful. If that were the case, why would I have pursued you back then when you're just a commoner?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, give me another chance! I promise I'll prove it to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was filled with hope as she looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne shook his head, his voice growing cold. "I'm sorry, but it is too late! I won't say it again&mdash;this is the last time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no feelings for you anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned away, unwilling to engage with Ophelia any further, striding towards Gerardo's lifeless body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the remnants of the two divine beings Gerardo had absorbed resurfaced before Osborne, he found himself standing in the presence of five vibrant corpses, each one exuding an uncanny semblance of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within them, Osborne felt an immense surge of energy. If he could harness it all and condense it into powerful blood energy, it might be enough to elevate every member of the Blood Demon faction to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ophelia's voice pierced through the tense atmosphere, filled with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, why won't you forgive me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've apologized! I've admitted my mistakes! What more do you want from me for you to forgive me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I supposed to grovel at your feet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't respond, turning a deaf ear to her pleas. Even as her voice cracked and spiraled into anguish behind him, he remained resolute, focused on the task ahead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
