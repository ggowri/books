  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a serious expression, quickly thinking of a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was at Class AA, his internal energy was still limited. In normal combat, one would use their own energy to continuously draw from the endless energy of the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was in the Dark Realm. The Dark Realm cut off other energy sources, preventing Osborne from drawing on the energy of the void. Every attack he made used his internal energy, with no way to replenish it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, it wouldn't take long before his energy was completely drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that happened, his strength would keep weakening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, his martial art aura. Each time he </span><span>defended,</span><span> it consumed a significant amount of energy. Under normal circumstances, he could easily absorb energy from the void to restore what was consumed by the martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the Dark Realm, once his martial art aura was consumed, it couldn't be replenished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The martial art aura would continue to weaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't be long before the martial art aura was extinguished. Without its protection, how could he possibly stand against Palmers?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, he would have no chance left and would just become a target for Palmers, who would kill him with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he had to quickly find a way to break Palmers' Dark Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, death would be the only thing waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do I break this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne was thinking, Palmers attacked again. In the Dark Realm, Palmers was like a god, able to effortlessly manipulate vast amounts of dark elemental power, launching terrifying attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could only use his martial art aura to defend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was sent flying again. His martial art aura flickered wildly, consuming a lot of energy but unable to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, this is just twenty percent of my power,"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you desperate yet? Do you want to kneel and beg me? Do you want to be my dog?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad, it's too late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers waved his hand again, and another terrifying dark attack struck. Osborne was </span><span>sent flying again, unable to dodge, and his martial art aura was consumed even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gripped the Goddess of Grain's scythe tightly, clenching his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't the type to sit and wait for death. He chose to go on the offensive. With the sharpness of the Goddess of Grain's scythe, as long as he could get close to Palmers, he was confident he could decapitate him in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the Goddess of Grain's scythe was originally a divine artifact of the Rosenthal family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers was extremely familiar with the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched Osborne charge at him, a disdainful sneer appeared on Palmers' face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood still, letting Osborne approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate. He swung the scythe down swiftly and forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp scythe instantly sliced Palmers' body in half, but Osborne felt no joy. He realized that it wasn't Palmers' real body that had been cut, but only an illusion left in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh, in my Dark Realm, I am the god! I can easily change positions within the Realm at any time. And you think you can catch me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this coldly, Palmers waved his hand again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark energy surged like waves, wildly sweeping towards Osborne, repeatedly crashing against his martial art aura and draining its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a short time, Osborne felt his martial art aura had already dimmed significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't go on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was serious. If he kept getting drained by Palmers, in just a few more minutes, his energy would be exhausted, and his martial art aura would be extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that happened, he would be as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must find a way to break this Dark Realm! The power of the Realm is strong, but it's not invincible. There must be a way to break it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to abandon his attack and focus entirely on defense, frantically thinking of a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Generally, there are three ways to break the power of a Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first method is brute force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as your power is strong enough, even a Realm can be shattered. But clearly, Osborne couldn't do that. Palmers was at Class AA, and so was he. Even if his strength was slightly greater than Palmers', it wouldn't be by much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, he wasn't strong enough to shatter Palmers' Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second method is internal disintegration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne's control over dark powers wasn't far behind Palmers', he might be able to create a breach in the Dark Realm and escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne still couldn't do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mastery over dark powers was the weakest of all his abilities. He hadn't even reached the intermediate level of dark power control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, trying to disintegrate Palmers' Dark Realm from within was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third method is using a counter ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among different powers, some have counter effects. If he could use a power that counters the Dark Realm, it wouldn't need to be especially strong to break it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What power could counter the Dark Realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes suddenly lit up.</span></p><div class="pagination">
