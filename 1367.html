  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Level Nine Divine Body, renowned as the Cosmic Divine Body, stands as the </span><span>ultimate paragon of strength in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even among the ranks of Deity Kings, few had ever attained such a lofty state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as Osborne endured the cycle of death and resurrection, his Divine Body drew increasingly more power from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. With each iteration, it grew stronger, edging closer and closer to the breakthrough into a Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only I can reach Level Nine, I might stand a chance against these spatial tides. Perhaps, there's still a slim possibility for me to leave this place alive..." Osborne whispered, his thoughts filled with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reverie was cut short as his Divine Body was once again torn asunder, his soul crushed into oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another death, another resurrection by the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The exact number of deaths had become a blur to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it already in the thousands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a shiver through his being. His fourth-step fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus granted him only 10 thousand resurrections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, the Lotus would abandon him, leaving him to perish forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of urgency gripped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't break through to Level Nine and find a way to counter these spatial tides before my resurrections are expended, the Lotus will leave me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when it does, it might even discard the Dimensional Microcosm on its petals... All those within will perish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's anxiety was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was his last lifeline. Without it, he faced eternal oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must hasten the breakthrough of my Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't afford to wait passively for each resurrection to incrementally increase its strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That could take thousands, even tens of thousands of cycles, and my resurrections would be long gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to actively enhance the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Breath of Celestial! That's it! Using the Breath of Celestial to refine my Divine Body will surely accelerate the transformation to Level Nine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed purpose, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the fleeting moments between each resurrection and death, he poured all his energy into casting the Breath of Celestial, harnessing the residual power left by the Lotus to refine his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every ounce of that power, which would have otherwise been wasted, was now being put to good use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum filled the air as Osborne felt the pace of his Divine Body's enhancement quicken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's working!" he exclaimed, a spark of hope igniting in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exulting, Osborne redoubled his efforts in casting the Breath of Celestial, sparing no moment to refine his Divine Body. He strained to inch closer and closer to that </span><span>transformative precipice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leap from Level Eight to Level Nine Divine Body was an arduous journey, a feat that countless Deity Kings had spent centuries, millennia, even countless eons toiling over yet failed to achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, even Osborne would be stymied at this threshold, wasting precious time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, ensnared in the fathomless depths of the spatial tide, Osborne's Divine Body was repeatedly torn asunder and resurrected by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and with the Breath of Celestial's mystical refining powers, his progression was accelerated like never before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of exhilaration as he sensed his Divine Body inching ever closer to the coveted Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Osborne felt the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's restoration growing slower, a disconcerting detachment slowly emerging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My resurrection count is dwindling. The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is ready to abandon me to conserve its strength! I must hasten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time ceased to exist in the depths of this nether realm; Osborne lost all sense of how long he had been trapped&mdash;a fleeting moment, or ten thousand years. He merely cycled through death and rebirth, ceaselessly invoking the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spatial tide had stabilized in magnitude, yet it still had the power to shred his Divine Body and crush his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Divine Body and soul grew stronger with each cycle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enhanced soul made invoking the Breath of Celestial a less taxing ordeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the bond with Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity weakened and abandonment felt imminent, Osborne finally sensed the transformative nexus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body, forged through repeated cycles of death and resurrection, had reached sufficient strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the transformation began!</span></p><div class="pagination">
