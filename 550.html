  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne let out a cold snort. By this point, it was too late to dodge, and he could only brace himself for the impact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pale yellow glow of martial art aura erupted from him instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next moment, a barrage of attacks landed on him, causing intense ripples in the martial art aura. It took only five seconds before the martial art aura finally shattered under the relentless onslaught.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The remaining force struck Osborne directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body was thrown backward, blood instantly trickling from the corner of his mouth. Even though his martial art aura was formidable, it couldn't withstand so many attacks. And while his physical body was strong, it was inevitable that he would suffer injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, he had managed to hold his ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had only suffered a minor injury, one that would heal quickly. He waved his hand, tearing open a dimensional rift, and with a confident smile, waved at the onlookers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! He's trying to escape!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd shouted, attempting to block Osborne's retreat, but it was already too late. He had stepped into the dimensional rift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Farewell!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Watch your under feet. I'll be back to ambush you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, his figure vanished, reappearing miles away in the next moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it, he actually has the power of space elemental!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's over there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Osborne had fled far through dimensional travel, most of the crowd possessed the Satan's Eye, allowing them not only to see through objects but also to have vision far beyond that of ordinary people. They quickly spotted Osborne's escape route and gave chase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam and David exchanged a glance and signaled to their respective branch bloodlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go after him together! We can't let him get away. His emblem will be ours!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, over a hundred people surged forward in pursuit of Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Osborne sneered. "You think you can catch me like this? In your dreams!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he tore open another dimensional rift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whoosh!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's figure vanished again, reappearing miles away in an instant. After a few more jumps, his figure completely disappeared from the crowd's sight. Even with the Satan's Eye, they could no longer see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pursuers were forced to come to a halt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it, he got away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is going to be tricky. With spatial power, if he's determined to escape, we won't be able to catch him unless we can surround him first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone frowned as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group found themselves frustrated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam let out a cold snort and exchanged a look with David. The two then led their branch bloodlines away from the main group of pursuers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"David, do you have any ideas?" Sam asked David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David smiled faintly. "spatial power are incredibly rare. I didn't expect him to have one. This makes things more complicated. Even though we can track him every fifteen minutes, he can still use spatial jumps to escape before we manage to surround him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In short, if we can't trap him, we have no way to stop him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam furrowed his brow tightly. "Is there no other way? Are we just going to watch as he becomes an heir?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's definitely not happening!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David scoffed. "Sam, don't worry. I promised to help you become the heir, and I will make sure it happens."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have a plan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's face lit up with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David's face bore a confident smile. "Yes, I have a way to catch him. Even with his spatial power, he won't escape my pursuit. It's just a bit more troublesome."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam was thrilled. "What are we waiting for then? Let's go after him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hold on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David smiled calmly. "We need to come up with a plan before we act, to make sure he doesn't escape again. Here's the plan: I'll use my methods to track him down and launch a surprise attack. If the attack succeeds, that's perfect; I'll bring the emblem back for you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With the strength of our two branch bloodlines, keeping the emblem will be a breeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If my assassination attempt fails, I'll keep him engaged. As long as I'm around, he won't have a chance to use his spatial power to escape! I'll need you to bring your people and surround him as soon as possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once we've got him surrounded, he's finished. With our combined strength, we'll crush him easily!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No problem! With you taking action, I have no doubt that guy doesn't stand a chance. How could he possibly escape your assassination?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David smirked, his face full of confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm just being cautious. Soon enough, you'll be hearing good news from me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm off to track him down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, David's figure quickly vanished from Sam's sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold smile spread across Sam's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial power? Is that your trump card? You've shown your hand too soon. You're finished!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The second Heir's Emblem is mine. No one can take it from me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Muttering to himself, Sam waved his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone, stand by."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Tony, Kent, Henry, and John, after some quick treatment, finally regained consciousness, though they were still in poor shape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But more than their physical injuries, what troubled them was their mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had been eliminated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Branch Bloodline Competition had just begun, and they hadn't even had the chance to showcase their strength before Osborne ambushed them and took them out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This filled them with fury and frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other powerful figures from their branch bloodline also looked grim, their hearts seething with hatred for Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the sound of footsteps echoed through the air.</p><div class="pagination">
