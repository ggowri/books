  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne unleashed his power, shattering the combined attack of the four adversaries with a single punch.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you find me?" Osborne asked, genuinely curious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had completely altered his appearance, changed his clothes from top to bottom, and even suppressed his aura.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the attackers smirked. "Axell, your disguise is impressive. You changed your entire look, and we were almost fooled! But you overlooked a few details. For instance, your shoes are too clean.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you were just a regular tourist who had been wandering around the mountains, your shoes would be caked with mud. But yours are spotless!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Plus, this is the Williamson family's private grounds, not open to the public. So you're not escaping!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a bit resigned; it was amazing that such a minor detail had given him away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine, then let's settle this!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne pulled out the Volt Hammer from Dimensional Space and struck out with it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air crackled with the sudden burst of lightning.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four members of the Williamson family were taken aback.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They quickly braced themselves, attempting to fend off the attack. They had witnessed Osborne defeat Abner with a single blow using the Volt Hammer before.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner was ranked 320th on the Godson Rankings and wielded a divine artifact.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In contrast, the four of them, though elders of the Williamson family and all Class AAA, were no match for Abner, let alone Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had only tried to stall him, hoping for reinforcements. Faced with Osborne's assault, they had no choice but to fight as a team.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The lightning struck them with devastating force, piercing through their defenses and heavily wounding them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air was soon filled with the faint smell of burnt flesh.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four were hurled violently backward, crashing to the ground, struggling to rise.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They stared at Osborne in fear.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered, saying, "Is that all you've got? You dare to hunt me down with such weak skills? Time to end this!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he prepared to finish them off, his Satan's Eye suddenly throbbed violently, a deep sense of danger erupting from within him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without a moment to think, Osborne quickly dodged his previous position.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A dark dagger sliced through the air where he had just stood, a faint shadow materializing and vanishing almost immediately.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne had seen enough.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Eityreia Organization?!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face hardened. The attacker was someone he recognized from the Honor Quest Ceremony&mdash;Mose, one of the Eityreia Organization assassins, had been sitting next to the attacker then.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, this was one of Mose's comrades.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Die!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could react, another figure appeared behind him, moving without any energy fluctuations, a dagger speeding toward his heart.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, Osborne was ready.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get lost!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spun around and delivered a powerful punch, sending the attacker flying through the air, blood spattering as the figure's eyes widened in shock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold voice cut through the tension. "You've figured out our Stealth Arts!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Mose, the top-tier assassin ranked 205th on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose emerged from the shadows, flanked by five more dark figures, all cloaked in black robes, their faces obscured except for their eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mose!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Mose, Osborne felt a wave of relief instead of panic.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This meant that Mose hadn't gone after Emma and the others. He diverted the attention of the Eityreia Organization assassins, which would have made Emma and her group safer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this only intensified the pressure on Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose sneered, saying, "Axell, I warned you. The moment you left the Williamson family's grounds, I'd come out here to take your head! Well, I'm here now. Is your head ready?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked. "My head's right here. Come and take it if you can! But you'd better watch out, or you might end up leaving yours behind!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mose laughed. "You think just because you beat Cuthbert at the Honor Quest Ceremony, you're on my level? You just got lucky!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, in the wild, even Cuthbert would be no match for me.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm coming for your head now!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Mose's body flickered and vanished into the void.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other five Eityreia Organization assassins followed suit, disappearing from sight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took a deep breath, focusing intently on the spatial fluctuations around him. The Class S Stealth Arts of the Eityreia Organization assassins caused subtle ripples in the space.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It didn't take long for Osborne to detect several spatial distortions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "One! Two! Three! Four! Five!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wait a minute!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There should be six Eityreia Organization assassins, but I only sense five fluctuations. Where's the sixth?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression turned serious.</p><div class="pagination">
