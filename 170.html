  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not from the same world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression became somewhat distant as memories of his ex-wife, Ophelia, surfaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia had said the same thing when they divorced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't from the same world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Osborne would have brushed it off, not bothering to argue. What Donna thought was her business and had nothing to do with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, I don't believe Clarissa and I aren't from the same world. I don't think I'm unworthy of her. In fact, I believe I'm more suited for her than Apollo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left everyone in the car stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked at Osborne in disbelief, their eyes wide. None of them expected Osborne to say something like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, do you mean it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's eyes widened. "Osborne, do you really like Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face was already flushed. She tried hard to maintain a composed expression, but a closer look would reveal a slight smile at the corners of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look out the window, pretending she hadn't heard Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna, however, wore a stern and cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Osborne, you finally showed your true colors! You do have ulterior motives for Clarissa! You really do like her. I was right all along!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, Clarissa is beautiful and has a good personality. Why wouldn't I like her? Do you have no confidence in her? Or do you think there's something wrong with my taste?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's face was filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm. Upon hearing that Apollo wanted to marry Clarissa soon, Osborne realized he couldn't take his time pursuing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to act quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if Apollo and Clarissa's wedding took place, it would be too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, he needed Clarissa to know his feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether Clarissa liked him, thought he was too direct, or found him presumptuous, Osborne couldn't worry about that now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne did feel somewhat confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense that Clarissa didn't dislike him. In fact, because of what happened fifteen years ago, Clarissa seemed to have a special affection for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he knew this might not be love, the fact that she didn't dislike him meant he had a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Donna had already made her position clear, Osborne decided not to push too hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, if Donna kicked him out, it would be a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly changed the subject. "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, I don't think Apollo will succeed. Skyefall Security won't lease the Class A defense system to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna snorted, "Why do you think that? You have no idea about the Chevalier family's influence! I can't imagine any reason Skyefall Security would refuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, wanting to say that since he was the real new owner of Skyefall Security, Apollo had no chance if he opposed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he didn't say that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "It's just a feeling. If you don't believe me, Ms. Donna Radcliffe, how about we make a bet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned. "What do you mean? What do you want to bet on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. "If I lose, I'll leave the Radcliffe Manor voluntarily. I'll never appear in front of Clarissa again, nor will I have any thoughts about her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Clarissa turned her head, frowning at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something but ultimately said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna, however, sneered, "Did you really say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "But if I win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I win, I hope you'll support me. I hope you'll agree to let me pursue Clarissa. Whether I succeed or not, you can't stop me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left everyone in the car speechless again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's face showed a mix of emotions. "You're dreaming! I've made myself clear, yet you still have such delusions? What makes you think you have the right to pursue Clarissa? What makes you think she'd let you? You're not from the same..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Donna could finish, Clarissa interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, I agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to Apollo, I prefer Osborne. While I know this might not be love, I'm grateful that Osborne likes me, and I'm willing to give him a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished, Donna was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn and Osborne were also taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a look of joy appeared on Osborne's face. He hadn't misjudged. Clarissa did have feelings for him, and he had a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's face turned dark as she alternated her gaze between Clarissa and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car fell into silence, with everyone feeling Donna's anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, Donna spoke, "Osborne, you're courting death! If Apollo finds out about your feelings for Clarissa, you'll die a terrible death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "That's my concern. But I know that if I do nothing and watch Clarissa marry Apollo, whom she doesn't love, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. That would be worse than death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words brought tears to Clarissa's eyes, and she looked at him with a mix of emotion and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna laughed in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! If you're seeking death, I'll let you! If you win, I'll support you and won't stop you from pursuing Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm telling you, you have no chance of success! The Chevalier family, the Radcliffe family, everyone will stop you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will die!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
