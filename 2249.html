  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the high-rise platform, Angela's face was a thundercloud as she fixed a scathing glare on Lenny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Fixing the draw? That's just plain shady!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lenny let out an awkward chuckle. "Maybe it's just a fluke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela flashed him a frosty smile. "Mr. Wilkens, do you really think I'm that easy to fool? You think I'll swallow that story?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lenny clammed up, and the air crackled with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact was, there had been something fishy about the draw. His nephew Vadim had come to him, asking him to make sure Osborne was his first opponent. He wanted to teach Osborne a lesson, and Lenny had agreed without batting an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it had seemed like a small favor at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never saw Angela's reaction coming. Now, it felt like he was between a rock and a hard place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he waved it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the end of the day, it's all about what you can bring to the ring! If Osborne can't hold his own against Vadim, it doesn't really matter if they meet now or later. If he can't even take down Vadim, even if he somehow lucks out and makes it into the top ten, he won't cut it in the city duel in Tempest Fortress City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela went quiet at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes drifted over to Osborne, who stood there cool as a cucumber, completely unfazed by Vadim's bluster or the pressure of the moment. That really threw her for a loop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does this guy have some ace up his sleeve?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she quickly shook off the thought.</span><br><span>No way! Vadim is the star core disciple among all the Ascension Ten members in the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect! Except for Jamar and Bethan, everyone else is at least one level, maybe even two, below him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Vadim might not be all that on the Racial Convergence Planet, but Osborne is only at Ascension Eight. There's no way he can go toe-to-toe with Vadim! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I just hope he doesn't get pummeled too badly and can still compete in the later rounds. That way, there's still a slim chance he can make it into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Angela focused intently on the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne and Vadim stood at opposite corners of the arena. Vadim radiated excitement and aggression, eager for the battle to begin, while Osborne remained tranquil, quietly drawing his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim's eyes glinted with greed at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A quasi-Sacred Artifact? Ha! You might have used that to shine in the group matches and make it to the top twenty, but it won't be enough to take me on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think you're the only one with a quasi-Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vadim slipped on a pair of gauntlets that shimmered with a faint light, an overwhelming aura bursting forth from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A quasi-Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lenny's nephew and one of the brawny core disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect, Vadim naturally boasted a quasi-Sacred Artifact. When it came to gear, he was head and shoulders above Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he'd been sitting at the peak of Ascension Ten for ages, his cultivation level polished to perfection and on the cusp of breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead certain that taking on Osborne, who was just at Ascension Eight, would be a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road!" Vadim hollered, throwing a look at the referee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The referee gave a nod and declared, "First match of the top twenty&mdash;Vadim versus Osborne. Begin..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second the words left his lips, Vadim shot forward like a rocket, his fists balled up and the gauntlets on his hands blazing brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, don't you even think about throwing in the towel! Eat this punch!" Vadim bellowed, unleashing a bone-chilling force that hurtled straight towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Even the spectators in the stands felt it like a colossal mountain bearing down on them. Everyone could feel their skin tingling, as if it would tear apart under Vadim's overpowering might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim's really stepped up his game, no doubt about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Obviously, he was just coasting through the group matches yesterday! But now? He's going all out against Osborne. If that guy doesn't tap out, he's going to be flattened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He doesn't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was on the edge of their seats, feeling the sheer force behind Vadim's punches. All eyes were locked on Osborne, eager to see his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he hunker down and defend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe try to dodge? Or throw in the towel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held his ground, as cool as a cucumber. He raised his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, deftly pulling back the string as a bolt of Sacred Power materialized in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Vadim's crushing might, Osborne knew he had to fire back with a Sacred Power arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim might be cocky, but given his strength, he had every reason to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in a whole different league compared to the dozen-odd opponents Osborne had faced in the group matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To beat him, Osborne had to up his game&mdash;just a little bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tapped into only a tiny bit of his Sacred Power. Once the arrow took full shape, he let it fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow sliced through the air, heading straight for Vadim's oncoming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow zoomed towards Vadim's fist. Before the two forces even clashed, Osborne was already yanking back the bowstring again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three more Sacred Power arrows popped into existence and shot off in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he was done, Osborne slung his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow over his back, his expression as calm as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the first Sacred Power arrow finally collided with Vadim's punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant they met, an explosive force erupted, sending shockwaves rippling outward that made everyone watching from the stands feel a sharp sting on their skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Vadim's terrifying punch was obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the Sacred Power arrow didn't fade; it continued soaring toward Vadim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight shook Vadim to his core, leaving him in disbelief. The audience below shared his shock, their eyes wide. No one had expected that a casual shot from Osborne could actually dismantle Vadim's formidable attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the arrow charged toward him, Vadim reacted instantly, clenching his fist with determination. He swung down with all his might, his strength bolstered by the power of his quasi-Sacred Artifact gauntlets. He knew he had to counter that arrow; it had already lost considerable power from its earlier clash. There was no way it could withstand the force of three thunderous punches barreling down on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could even catch his breath, three more arrows came screaming towards him, each one swifter and more powerful than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim's face darkened in an instant. "Smash them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought his fists crashing down, but this time, he was up against fully-formed, undamaged arrows. As they just barely brushed past him, Vadim felt a searing, explosive power coursing through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face went pale, and he was rooted to the spot in sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I can't stop them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hopeless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening explosion, the three arrows ripped through his defenses and pierced his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh-oh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the referee snapped out of his daze and sprinted towards Vadim, trying to shield him from Osborne's non-stop onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was a lost cause!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Sacred Power arrows pierced Vadim's shoulder and abdomen, then erupted into a blinding explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim's battered body went flying out of the ring and crashed to the ground below. He was knocked out cold, completely defeated, not even able to let out a peep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deathly silence fell over the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were on Osborne, who had already stowed his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow. He looked as calm as ever, like he'd seen this coming from a mile away. The shock on everyone's faces was </span><span>evident</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim had been taken down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a jaw-dropping display of skill, Osborne had single-handedly demolished the champion of the last Sect Tournament in the blink of an eye!</span></p><div class="pagination">
