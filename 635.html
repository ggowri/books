Osborne looked at his ranking with no visible change in expression, nor did he seem anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The war has only just begun. The territories currently occupied by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> could still be reclaimed later. It is too early to determine who would win or lose in the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't expected that even Vincent, Matthew, and Emma couldn't withstand the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' attack and had to rely on the solid defenses of the Draco Group headquarters to prevent losing entire coastal provinces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "I need to speed up. If all six coastal provinces fall to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, they'll likely push further inland, and Campbell might not be safe either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't going to wait passively. Staying in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> wasn't just about protecting Clarissa. It was also about becoming a shadowy figure striking against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But first, Osborne needed to understand the full extent of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was currently watching a video Matthew had just uploaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had launched a fierce attack on the Draco Group headquarters in Jalmar, which Matthew was defending.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew had recorded the battle and shared it in a chatroom created specifically for the six heirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along with the video, Matthew had posted a message: [Everyone, this war isn't just a competition among us six heirs. It's a fight for the Augustine family's survival. We need to share information and help each other because the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> are much stronger than I anticipated. We must cooperate to combat them. Here's what happened when they attacked me. The situation isn't good, and I can't hold out much longer.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading Matthew's message, Osborne's expression grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Even Matthew sounded so pessimistic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly clicked on the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footage was from the Draco Group headquarters in Jalmar, which was built like a fortress. Despite this, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> chose to attack it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of shadowy figures appeared first, transforming into terrifying Werewolves with sharp teeth and claws, each at least Class A-.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They attacked furiously, leaving deep marks on the strong walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't stop there. Next, a group of </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> transformed into Titans, each standing at least nine to twelve feet tall and possessing immense strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those Titans were also Class A-.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came </span><span>Taurens</span><span> and Blood Clan members, over a thousand shape-shifting metahumans, relentlessly attacking the headquarters in Jalmar, creating a nightmarish scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that alone wasn't enough to make Matthew so despondent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly realized that these Class A- shape-shifting metahumans were just cannon fodder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' real main force consisted of identical-looking individuals, including several Medusas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were at least dozens of Medusas, resembling clones, each with Class A strength, terrifying petrification power, and formidable combat skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, there were many Class A and above Werewolves and Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was a powerful figure in a black robe, clearly a Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Matthew was strong, he was easily pushed back by this leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, a Class AAA elder from the Augustine family managed to hold off the leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Matthew's team eventually repelling the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' attack, their losses were significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching the video, Osborne's face darkened. "The King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> must have mastered some kind of cloning technology. Otherwise, it's impossible to have so many Medusas, Werewolves, and Blood Clan metahumans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Emma sent a message in the chat forum: [Matthew is right. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> are stronger than we thought. We six need to cooperate and share information. My situation is similar to Matthew's. The enemy numbers and types are about the same."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma posted her battle video next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly watched it and saw that the situation was indeed similar. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> used numerous Class A- Werewolves, Titans, and Blood Clans as shock troops, with groups of Class A Medusas, Werewolves, and Blood Clans as the main force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class AA enemies were fewer, about a dozen, led by a Class AAA figure in a black robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Vincent uploaded his battle video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was similar, but Vincent managed to fend off the enemies more easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the video, Osborne saw Vincent overpowering the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' Class AAA and killing a Class AA before the enemy temporarily withdrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Lance uploaded his video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his footage, he was almost overwhelmed by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. The headquarters' </span><span>defenses were quickly broken through. They had to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Owen uploaded his video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's situation was slightly better than Lance's. Although he suffered heavy losses, he managed to repel the enemy and keep the headquarters from falling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne knew Owen might not hold out much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's going on over there? How did you end up in last place with a score of negative thirty-one hundred? Did you abandon all the territories you were supposed to defend without even fighting the enemy?" Matthew asked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
