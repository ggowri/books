  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, it was incredibly quiet!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the stage, Yvonne was bound by Clara's Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain, leaving her unable to move. Clearly, Clara was already the winner.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara's words were like a bomb dropped into the crowd. Everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She won!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne really lost!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, everyone thought the nine competing princes and princesses would definitely take the top spots in their groups, while all the other ordinary contestants were just vying for tenth place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There is a huge gap in strength between them and the princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, the unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the group melee, Yvonne unexpectedly lost to an ordinary contestant, becoming the first Royal Family member to be defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone fell silent, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They thought, "Should we cheer loudly?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But that doesn't seem appropriate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, today is the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony of the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Almost all Royal Family members, including branch bloodline members, are here. They are currently watching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A member of the Royal Family lost. Everyone dared not cheer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They noticed that most of the Royal Family members looked gloomy at this moment. Even Frederick seemed a bit stunned, slightly furrowing his brows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, he hadn't expected a Royal Family member to lose to an ordinary contestant before this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, according to their previous Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, Clara was ranked last!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a princess of the Royal Family, Yvonne was defeated by Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This felt like a heavy slap across the faces of the Royal Family members. At this moment, they all felt a bit humiliated and angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the stage, Yvonne looked dazed and absent-minded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She lost!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She really lost to an ordinary contestant. Among the nine princes and princesses participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, she was the first and only one to lose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Yvonne felt countless Royal Family members from the stands looking at her, their gazes cold, angry, and disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If possible, she wished she could find a crack in the ground to hide in, because she knew she had disgraced the Royal Family!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She brought shame to the Royal Family's honor and pride.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, someone said, "Yvonne, the battle is over. Come down now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's Callista.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She showed a gentle smile and continued, "Failure isn't scary. What's scary is being too arrogant and overconfident, thinking you're invincible! Although you lost this time, it doesn't mean anything! Instead, it shows you that there's always someone stronger than you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, don't be so arrogant! When you go back, make sure to train hard and work even harder to improve yourself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista's words instantly brought Yvonne back to her senses. Hearing Callista's gentle voice, she immediately felt comforted and looked at Callista with immense gratitude.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly bowed to Callista. "Thank you for your advice, Queen Callista. I will work harder! I will never disgrace the Royal Family again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista smiled and said, "It's okay. As the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, we can handle failure! We've never claimed to be invincible! So, don't overthink it and get ready for the next battle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although you ended up second in the group, you're not eliminated yet. Maybe you still have a chance to make it into the top ten and reclaim your spot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gaze turned icy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was not her biological daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as Frederick's wife and the queen, Callista had to step forward at this moment to comfort Yvonne and say something to restore the Royal Family's dignity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Yvonne was not eliminated yet. As long as she makes it into the top ten and the nine princes and princesses take the top nine spots, none of this will matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Yvonne wants to make it into the top ten, then Callista will have to tamper with the draw!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista looked at the contestants of Group Ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Group Ten, there were no princes or princesses, so the first place among them would inevitably be an ordinary contestant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista thought, "When the time comes, I'll make Yvonne draw the first place from Group Ten during the draw! That way, as long as she eliminates the first place from Group Ten, she can make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Clara, even if she gets first place in the group, she&rsquo;ll at most make it into the top ten, but definitely not the top five.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly came up with a plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Zorro shouted, "Contestants of Group Ten, step onto the stage!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, it's our turn!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy looked at Osborne. At this moment, she was very eager and excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Clara's stunning performance on the stage and her dominant victory over Yvonne greatly encouraged and boosted Leroy's confidence, as her strength was similar to Clara's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Clara could defeat Yvonne, then Leroy could too. In Group Ten, aside from Osborne, no one was her match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Leroy couldn't wait to showcase her strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "You're that eager, huh? Then later on the stage, I won't make a move! I'll leave the other ten to you! I'll count on you to get us into the top twenty!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Leroy blushed instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rely on me? You're so annoying! But fine, you really don't have to make a move, leave them all to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's fighting spirit grew stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She and Osborne quickly stepped onto the stage. Immediately, they felt a cold, angry gaze fixed on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Brenda!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered, "Osborne, our feud can finally be settled! In the zone duel, you took the championship that belonged to me. Today, I will take back everything I lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want everyone to know that I am the strongest under the Empyrean Sacredness of Eastern Zone 3!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, are you overconfident? Or did you just fall asleep? Didn't you see Clara defeat Princess Yvonne? Are you really the strongest under the Empyrean Sacredness of Eastern Zone 3? Do you deserve it? Do you think you can beat Clara?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's words instantly made Brenda feel embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She forced a smile but couldn't say a word because she really had no way to refute.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara suddenly erupted and defeated Yvonne. Brenda was also startled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She believed she was absolutely no match for Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But facing Osborne's mockery, she didn't hold back and insisted, "So what if Clara is strong? Until we face off, I don't think I'll lose! But now, I can defeat you first and show everyone that I'm stronger than you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne still smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad, you don't have the chance, because in my eyes, you're not the strongest under Eastern Zone 3's Empyrean Sacredness, not even in the top three!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides Clara, Leroy can easily defeat you too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he looked at Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You handle her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy quickly nodded, staring coldly at Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, you're not worthy to face Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can easily defeat you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
