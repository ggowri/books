  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne with mockery, no longer believing he could turn the situation around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bastard has the same name as the recently famous mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security. What a pity, same name but different fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One is a celestial being who terrified the Chevalier family and made them flee </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>. The other cannot control himself and tries to assault and rape an innocent woman in public, caught in the act. He is simply seeking death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, even though they share the same name, they are worlds apart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, Osborne, is a middle-aged man of immense power, like a death god from hell. He has blood-red long hair and kills with ease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that Osborne is said to be eight feet tall, with hands so big he could easily twist someone's head off. Derek's head was reportedly twisted off by him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security has risen to prominence! With that mysterious boss Osborne, they are on par with the other six ancient families of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have decided to go to </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security for cooperation. No matter how much it costs, I want to hire two bodyguards from </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security. With such protection, </span><span>who would dare to attack me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's chatter shifted, and they started discussing </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the mysterious boss of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security also shared the name Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no one thought that the young Osborne before them was the same person with the blood-red hair and terrifying prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all believed Osborne was done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's bodyguards had completely surrounded Osborne, their guns aimed at his head, shouting loudly for him to surrender immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne remained coldly smiling, showing no reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are seeking death! Since you refuse to surrender, we will help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of Wesley's bodyguards was about to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a sharp shout came from the stairway, filled with urgency and anger. With her voice, the surrounding chatter instantly ceased, and everyone looked up in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a woman in her twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a delicate, gentle face, like a friendly neighbor, but her frosty expression and commanding aura indicated her extraordinary status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is Ms. Montague!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her, the crowd's expressions changed, and they hurriedly bowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Austin Montague, the sole heir of the top family in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, the Montague family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd parted, allowing Austin to approach the front. Ignoring their flattery, she anxiously looked at Osborne with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's expression shifted, growing serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Osborne was acquainted with Austin. They had previously gone to the Ashford family's diamond dealing market together, causing Wesley a huge loss, including a diamond mine from the Ashford family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Montague, are you planning to speak up for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley gritted his teeth and said coldly, "Osborne is trying to assault and rape my guest in public. As the young lady of the Montague family, you would not want to make excuses for him, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's eyes turned icy as she looked at Wesley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I want to do does not require your approval."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then glanced at Ava, who had disheveled hair and torn clothes, feigning a frightened and tearful appearance, which elicited sympathy from many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Austin's expression turned disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked to Osborne's side and whispered, "Osborne, are you alright? What is going on? Were you set up? I do not believe you would be interested in that woman. She looks dirty and has probably been with many men. How could you possibly like her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, you are my man. If you need a woman, you can come to me anytime. I can </span><span>satisfy any position you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt embarrassed and signaled Austin to lower her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin stuck out her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, this is a plot, right? Humph, I will take you away, and let's see who dares to stop us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Austin grabbed Osborne's hand, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was the sole heir of the Montague family, one of the top elite families in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> with vast wealth and powerful security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of wealth and strength, the Montague family was almost on par with the six ancient families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason they were not considered one of the ancient families was that they lacked some of the deep-rooted history and a few top-tier metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's status was unmatched by anyone else present except for Clarissa. She could easily forcefully take Osborne away if she wished, and no one would dare stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was not what Osborne wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly stopped Austin and said quietly, "Austin, thanks for your kindness, but no need. I want to handle this myself. If I leave with you, would that not just cement the stain on my name?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone will think I really assaulted her and tried to rape her. How would I face it? How would I ever marry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled as he spoke, causing Austin to glare at him and show hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "Then I will tell them about our relationship! I will let everyone know that I am your woman. If you need anything, you can come to me anytime, and I can fulfill any position you desire. How could you possibly be interested in such a dirty woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will that clear your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's face was filled with resolve.</span></p><div class="pagination">
