  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as the guy finished talking, the crowd fell silent, all eyes on him in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne glanced over as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man had an emblem with his details on his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was Clay Rosenthal, 36 years old, from the Rosenthal family in Yalynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was surprised. "Seriously? The Rosenthal family from Yalynch? This guy looks way stronger than Aria and Aresta."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whoa, it's Clay from Yalynch!" someone gasped nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clay's trying for the Godson Rankings again! He's the third-ranked Godson in Yalynch and the second-strongest in the Rosenthal family's younger generation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He tried to break into the rankings a year ago but didn't make it. After a year of training, though, he's even more powerful. He might actually pull it off this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Clay makes it, the Rosenthal family will have two members on the Godson Rankings. That would put them in the top twenty divine families worldwide."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing the chatter around him, Osborne picked up a few key points.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Stuart's face lit up with excitement, clearly itching for a fight. Unfortunately, since Clay was challenging someone from the rankings, Stuart didn't stand a chance of getting on stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there anyone from the Godson Rankings here? I don't care what your rank is. Come fight me!" Clay called out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clay, give it a rest! None of the ranked fighters are going to show up today. If you want to challenge someone, come back tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But hey, I'm going for the rankings tomorrow too. How about we have a go at it then?" a cold voice suddenly responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone turned to see who spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's Satoru from the Byrd family in Ransford! He's the fourth-ranked Godson there and another strong contender for the Godson Rankings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's only thirty-two!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With his talent, it's only a matter of time before he makes it onto the rankings. He might even get a high spot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Satoru and Clay both have a real shot at making the rankings. Their fight is going to be something else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd around the ring was buzzing with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Osborne couldn't help but pay attention to Satoru. For some reason, just looking at Satoru made him feel uneasy, though he had to admit, the guy was incredibly strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His aura was sharp, way more intense than most of the others around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ransford's fourth-ranked Godson, huh?" Osborne muttered, glancing over at Clay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was hoping Clay would take up Satoru's challenge. Both of them had a real shot at making it onto the Godson Rankings, and their fight could give him a better idea of what kind of strength that actually required.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph," Clay sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Satoru, I've heard all about you. Born with some cosmic freakshow, and the shadow of the Yamata no Orochi fused into you. When you hit Class A, people say snakes swarmed to worship you. They're calling you the future of Ransford's extra energy, the reincarnation of the Yamata no Orochi itself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru gave a small, dismissive smile. "Clay, save the backstory. Everyone here is a top-tier talent. Who didn't have some kind of cosmic event when they were born? Who didn't cause a stir when they broke through to Class A?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Being a top-tier talent is just the ticket to get into this event, not something to boast about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru remained completely calm, his expression unruffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And you're no exception. Didn't the holy bells of Yalynch ring endlessly when you were born? And when you hit Class A, wasn't there a divine light that descended from the heavens to bless you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay smirked, a proud glint in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're right. Everyone here is top-tier. But even among the best, there's still a pecking order. If you want to fight, then let's fight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, I'll take you down today and use it as a warm-up for the Godson Rankings tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay's fighting spirit flared up as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru, equally fired up, shot back, "You're way too cocky! You think you can beat me? I'll crush you and use you as my stepping stone to secure my spot on the rankings tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Satoru leaped onto the ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd went wild, eager to see these two go head-to-head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment they were on the platform, they wasted no time, diving straight into battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The extra energy coming off them was terrifying, crashing against each other with a force that sent shockwaves through the air. The sheer power of their clash left everyone watching in stunned silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne watched the intense fight, he found himself deep in thought, his expression turning serious as he furrowed his brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"These guys are insanely strong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their power might even rival Luca's. And it looks like they're still holding back, keeping their real trump cards hidden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this is what it takes just to have a shot at the Godson Rankings, then how terrifying must the people already on the list be?"</p><div class="pagination">
