  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A slender figure suddenly appeared in the sky, his gaze deep and penetrating.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dressed in a black robe adorned with golden embroidery and crowned with a golden diadem, he radiated an aura that seemed to draw everyone's attention instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Lord Malevolence&mdash;Zayne!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All hail the esteemed Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All hail the esteemed Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound echoed like a tidal wave. In an instant, the countless members of the Dark Deity Legion, numbering in tens of billions, bowed in unison, their voices rising in a chorus of reverence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each face reflected respect and adoration, their eyes sparkling with excitement and fervor. Just the sight of Zayne filled them with a sense of glory, their cheeks flushed with pride, worries fading away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed wholeheartedly that with the Lord Malevolence stepping in, no problem was insurmountable.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was their war god, their totem.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rise," Zayne commanded with a gentle wave of his hand, allowing the Dark Deity Legion to stand once more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze then shifted to Isa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was captivated, her heart racing at the sight of Lord Malevolence for the first time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a surge of energy, as if she could hardly contain herself, itching to spar with him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin paled at the sight of him. Deep within their eyes, a flicker of panic and fear betrayed their composure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had faced Lord Malevolence a thousand years ago and had suffered his wrath.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew all too well how terrifying he could be.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A millennium had passed since then. The current Lord Malevolence was now a far more fearsome figure than ever before. What level of power had he achieved? It was anyone's guess.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the pressure on Clarissa, Emma, and Austin was immense.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they were within the Sanctum of Night, feeling its protective power, which allowed them to breathe a little easier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept their eyes locked on Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept across Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and the dazed God of Time, a smile creeping across his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was a smile that sent chills down their spines.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goddess of Fate, God of Death, Goddess of Life, and God of Time... impressive! I thought you had all perished, yet here you are, returned from the cycle of reincarnation. Truly remarkable!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It took only a thousand years for all four of you to come back. It seems that the God of Night has mastered some means of interfering with reincarnation, allowing you to return so smoothly, huh?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the expressions of Clarissa and the others shifted, their brows furrowing tightly as they exchanged glances, but they remained silent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox, however, interjected in disbelief, "Zayne, what are you talking about? The God of Night has the ability to interfere with reincarnation? That's impossible! Not even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior possesses such power! Even if they entered the cycle themselves, they would likely be lost in it, their memories shattered, unable to return!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence merely shrugged, his tone casual. "Then how do you explain that all four of them managed to reincarnate within a millennium? And their returns were so perfectly timed... If there wasn't any external intervention, how could they have all returned together like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox fell silent, realizing the logic in Lord Malevolence's argument.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four interconnected beings reincarnating simultaneously was far too coincidental to dismiss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and even horror spread across his face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interfering with reincarnation... Whoa!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the God of Night really that powerful?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence chuckled, his tone nonchalant. "The God of Night is undeniably powerful; otherwise, I wouldn't regard him as my greatest rival. I even invited you all to assist me in dealing with him! But he's not strong enough to manipulate the cycle of reincarnation with sheer force. As you mentioned, even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior can't do that!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, the God of Night must possess a Sacred Artifact&mdash;one that can intervene in the cycle of reincarnation!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a glint of greed flickered in Lord Malevolence's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's eyes widened, his breath quickening, mirroring that same greed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Sacred Artifact?! One that can alter reincarnation?! Wow!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even among Empyrean Sacredness warriors, few owned such powerful artifacts. In fact, most of them didn't have a Sacred Artifact at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the Racial Convergence Planet, the appearance of any unclaimed Sacred Artifact would spark a bloody struggle, with top Supernal Deity Kings and even Empyrean Sacredness warriors fighting tooth and nail to claim it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, a Sacred Artifact capable of influencing reincarnation would be worth far more than a typical one. In the hands of someone who needed it, it would be a priceless treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Maddox felt an overwhelming urge to track down the God of Night, eliminate him, and seize that Sacred Artifact for himself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But glancing at Lord Malevolence beside him, he regained his composure and said, "Zayne! Forget about what you promised me before! I have just one request now: once we take down the God of Night and obtain that Sacred Artifact, you have to let me borrow it a few times!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence fixed his gaze on Maddox, then smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! We're friends, after all. You came all the way from the distant Racial Convergence Planet to help me; how could I possibly shortchange you? Whatever I have is yours! Once we defeat the God of Night and get that Sacred Artifact, you can use it as much as you want."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a grin broke across Maddox's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Isa let out a cold snort, interrupting the two as they casually plotted how to divide the Sacred Artifact after taking down the God of Night.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was stern as she addressed them, "Lord Malevolence, aren't you getting ahead of yourself? You think you can eliminate my teacher and seize his Sacred Artifact? Let's not even discuss whether he actually has such an Artifact. Even if he does, do you really think you can pull it off?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence turned his attention to Isa, his expression calm. "So, you're Isa? Are you really the disciple of the God of Night?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa straightened her back, pride radiating from her. "Of course I am!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "I didn't expect the God of Night to have such an exceptional disciple. Your strength is nearly on par with his&mdash;if not equal!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must admit, in this regard, I can't compare to the God of Night! A thousand years ago, he trained several maidens and guards into the top warriors of the Celestara Planet Human Community, causing me no small amount of trouble</span><span> for me</span><span>. They were known as the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, he's produced an even more outstanding disciple!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night is truly remarkable! If he weren't holed up in this barren, cramped Celestara Planet and instead ventured into a larger world, like the Racial Convergence Planet, with his strength and skills, I believe he could easily establish a top-tier superpower and become a major figure in the Human Community!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I would love to be friends with him, but alas..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lord Malevolence spoke, a menacing glint flashed in his eyes. "It's a pity he chose to stand against me! Anyone who hinders my efforts to rebuild the Malevolence Empire is my enemy!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, even though I admire his talent and abilities, I must eliminate him to clear the path!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he refuses to show himself now, then I'll take care of all you pesky obstacles first, forcing him to confront me in battle!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
