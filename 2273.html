  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the arena fell into an eerie silence. After Osborne took the full brunt of Leroy's Inferno Drake Lance and knocked her unconscious, everyone was left in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't take long for the crowd to erupt into a cacophony of chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy's gone down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm floored! She wielded the Sacred Artifact, the Inferno Drake Lance, and still came up short! And it seems Osborne swooped in to save her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy just couldn't rein in the might of that Sacred Artifact. In the end, it addled her brain and sent her off the deep end. If Osborne hadn't stepped in sharpish and knocked her out cold, she'd have been in for some serious blowback and long-term damage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's the victor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the champ!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the crowd from the Mystic Sirius Sect erupted into thunderous cheers. Osborne's win meant he was now the unrivaled king of the city duel, with a spotless record.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a century since a disciple from the Mystic Sirius Sect had even cracked the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, not only had they made it onto the podium, but they'd snagged the championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lots of the senior disciples from the Mystic Sirius Sect couldn't help but shed tears of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the bigwigs from Azure Haven Academy finally jumped into action. They dashed onto the stage to check on Leroy's condition. A wave of relief washed over them as they heaved sighs of relief in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The blowback wasn't too bad. A bit of medicine and a couple of weeks' rest, and she'll be back on track! It won't crimp her potential or dampen her talent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a relief!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, they turned their mixed-emotion gazes towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A maelstrom of feelings swirled within them&mdash;anger, frustration, but also gratitude. They knew that Osborne's timely move had saved Leroy from serious harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he'd hesitated for even a split second longer, Leroy would have been toast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Azure Haven Academy, Leroy was a once-in-a-blue-moon talent. If her gifts got derailed, it would be a colossal loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they were thankful to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the thought of Osborne walking away with the championship&mdash;and the hefty price tag of over two million Sacred Crystals&mdash;made their hearts ache. They felt as if they had taken a massive hit in this city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even wished they could wipe that smug smile off Osborne's face with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, two million Sacred Crystals could buy several Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Angela appeared by Osborne's side, her concern evident as she looked him over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single sight was like a cold splash of water, dousing any underhanded schemes brewing in the minds of Azure Haven Academy's higher-ups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were no strangers to Angela's true standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a disciple on a training stint from the mighty Fairy Moon Sect, she was off-limits, a force not to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you alright?" Angela asked, her brow furrowed in worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Osborne to take the full force of Leroy's Inferno Drake Lance. Seeing the Eclipse War Armor shatter and the moment the Sacred Artifact struck him, she nearly stopped breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a Sacred Artifact, for crying out loud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its power was off the charts, and even she wouldn't dream of going toe-to-toe with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, spitting out a bit of blood and that was it? Seemed like he was none the worse for wear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he suffering from internal injuries?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela fretted, a knot of worry forming in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot her a serene smile. "Thanks for caring, Ms. Olsen, but I'm good! Looks like I've bagged the championship, right? I recall you said you'd give me a surprise if I won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I'm itching to know what it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela gave him an eye-roll. "As long as you're okay! As for that surprise, just be patient&mdash;you'll find out soon enough! But for now, congrats on your win! You've made me beam with pride, and you've put the Mystic Sirius Sect back in the spotlight! You're now the mightiest one below the Empyrean Sacredness in Tempest Fortress City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a brilliant smile lit up Angela's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would've ever guessed that Osborne would manage to take down all his tough competitors in the city duel of Tempest Fortress City and claim the championship in such a jaw-dropping way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was truly a classic underdog tale!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela couldn't help but swell with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd put her trust in Osborne and wagered ten thousand Sacred Crystals on his victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, she figured that money was as good as gone, like throwing it into the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But look at him now&mdash;he'd pulled it off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she placed her bet, the odds of Osborne winning were a mind-boggling 130 to 1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant her initial stake had ballooned to a staggering 1.3 million Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a small fortune&mdash;enough to keep her set for training resources for years to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, her excitement practically oozing out, "Nice work!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the city duel </span><span>ain't</span><span> over yet. You should take a breather down there for now! There's still the awards ceremony and the expedition ceremony coming up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, and give me your betting slip! I'll go and collect your winnings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Azure Haven Academy even thinks about stiffing you, I'll have a chat with Ms. Alba, and they'll be kicking themselves for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said this loud and clear for everyone to hear. Nearby, the bigwigs from Azure Haven Academy couldn't help but scowl, their faces turning sour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they remembered Angela's real identity and just how powerful Adriana was, they felt a sense of powerlessness wash over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no other option but to fork over the money. Trying any funny business would be a waste of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sinking feeling, they carried the unconscious Leroy away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, the city duel went on, but nobody was bothered about the remaining matches. All eyes were fixed on Osborne, with looks of a mixture of awe and disbelief on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underdog had really made his name!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the duel kicked off, almost everyone had taken it for granted that Leroy would snatch the championship, considering her overwhelming might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then came Osborne, who defeated Leroy, Marreese, Tyson, Pero, and even Clara, and finally clinched the title of the city </span><span>duel</span><span> champion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne had gotten the better of Clara earlier, some had murmured that he must have bribed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, no one entertained such ideas anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had soundly trounced Leroy, who was armed with a Sacred Artifact, leaving no room for doubt about his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the champion, hands down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the city duel wrapped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a look at the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The champion was Osborne from the Mystic Sirius Sect, who had an undefeated record of 15 wins and 0 losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The runner-up was Clara from Fantasia Isle, with 14 wins and 1 loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking third place was Leroy from Azure Haven Academy, </span><span>with</span><span> </span><span>13 wins and 2 losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese from Azure Haven Academy finished in fourth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson from Fantasia Isle landed in fifth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan from the Mystic Sirius Sect claimed seventh place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar from the Mystic Sirius Sect secured the ninth spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Leroy had been knocked out by Osborne, she was unable to participate in the subsequent battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Clara won by default, which enabled her to overtake Leroy at the last moment and secure the runner-up position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the entire city duel, Clara had only been defeated by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Leroy, who had been the top favorite to win the championship, she ended up in third place after losing to both Osborne and Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous champion, Marreese, had a disappointing performance and finished in fourth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Bethan and Jamar from the Mystic Sirius Sect also managed to make it into the top ten.
