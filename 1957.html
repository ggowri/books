  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really going to help me compress my power?" Osborne was momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the Infinite Devouring Eyes, pondering, "Could it be that the Infinite Devouring Eyes is doing this on purpose? Perhaps when it tried to seize the Tree Heart energy, it couldn't outpace Primordial and came up with this scheme to force Primordial to 'spit out' the Tree Heart energy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... how could the Infinite Devouring Eyes have a will of its own?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would make it a true monster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, this has to be all coincidental!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, this won't have any backlash on you, right? Will it hinder your transformation into a real World Tree in the future?" He felt a twinge of guilt inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial huffed in response, "Of course, it will affect me! But it won't stop me from evolving into the true World Tree! To achieve that, I need to merge the Tree Hearts of all eight other World Trees! I've already fused with one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helping you compress your energy will only cost me some Tree Heart energy, not the Tree Heart itself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were otherwise, I wouldn't give a damn about your survival."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne let out a breath of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given that you've fused with the Tree Heart, sharing a bit of its energy with me is the least you could do! After all, without my help, there's no way you could defeat the Eighth World Tree offshoot and acquire its Tree Heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial snapped back, irritation lacing its voice, "Is sharing just a bit all you're hoping for? Your eye has already snatched away 30 percent of my Tree Heart energy! Now, to help you compress energy, I'll have to fork over at least another 30 percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That energy is crucial to my power! I've barely even refined it, and you lot have already taken away at least 60 percent of it... You're all nothing but thieves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resentment in Primordial's tone was palpable, and Osborne couldn't help but chuckle awkwardly, realizing that perhaps he had pushed his luck a bit too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to linger on that topic, he quickly shifted gears. "Alright, consider it a debt I owe you! But we really need to get down to business! If you don't help me compress this energy soon, I'm going to blow up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood! Let's get on with it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This type of extreme energy compression is a unique technique we World Tree offshoots rarely use. This is a special deal just for you," Primordial replied, still sounding somewhat forlorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Primordial's tree body began to tremble violently. A massive surge of emerald-green energy cascaded from its roots, trunk, and leaves, pouring into Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compress!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a complex chain of events exploded within Osborne. He could hardly comprehend how Primordial was achieving this, but that immense and pure power within him was indeed being compressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy, already pure, became even more concentrated and refined through the compression, each unit of power now capable of amplifying its explosive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the energy of ordinary cultivators was like gas, then Osborne's previously refined power could now be likened to a liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the same volume of energy, his strength would be more potent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Primordial aimed to do was convert this already liquid-like energy into a solid state!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne remained at the highest Deity King Level, the amount of power he could contain was now several times greater, enhancing the force of his eventual outburst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This process continued over three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After three relentless days, Osborne felt the deluge of energy flowing from the Infinite Devouring Eyes completely merge within him, undergoing Primordial's intense compression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was now brimmed with explosive power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, Primordial appeared somewhat weakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial halted its movements, grumbling, "Damn it, what a loss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seventy percent of the Eighth World Tree offshoot's Tree Heart energy went to you! All I have left is a measly 30 percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That offshoot was an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King! Even though it was heavily injured at the time, the leftover energy, though scarce, would have been enough for me to rise to Ascension Six Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I can barely make it to Ascension Five, maybe even just Ascension Four!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback by Primordial's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You only got 30 percent of the Eighth World Tree offshoot's energy and can reach Ascension Four? Or even Ascension Five? I got 70 percent, so why am I still stuck at the highest Deity King Level? I haven't even broken through to Ascension One Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow, trying to wrap his head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows with you! You're a freak of nature! Sure, you're at the highest Deity King Level, but the power inside you rivals that of Ascension Two or even Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You could break through to Supernal Deity King anytime once you leave this place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, that 70 percent of Tree Heart energy? You only got a portion of it! Most of it went to that bizarre eye and was used to help compress your power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So just be grateful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in realization. "So that's how it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he smiled, "Regardless, we both gained a lot this time! So, are you at Ascension Four Supernal Deity King now? Or Ascension Five?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial retorted, "Neither! I haven't had the chance to absorb it yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, my strength is only about equivalent to an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King! Once I fully absorb the Tree Heart energy, I might hit the peak of Ascension Four, but whether I reach Ascension Five depends on luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thrilled. "Take your time to absorb it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should leave this place! I need to find somewhere to break through to Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial cautioned, "You'd better not rush! Your power has just been compressed, and this extreme compression greatly enhances your strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the same amount of energy, your attack power is stronger than others! But your power isn't fully stabilized yet! If you try to break through to Supernal Deity King right away, your power could become loose again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So I suggest you take some time to stabilize that compressed power, allowing it to become your new norm! When you do finally break through to Supernal Deity King, you'll be able to maintain that compressed power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "Thanks for the heads-up! I know what to do now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he enveloped himself in spatial energy. "Let's get out of here first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne left the deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no need for him to linger here any longer. While there were treasures to be found, he had left behind 100 Spatial Clones that were more than capable of searching for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been over three months since I left the Hudson family! Time to head back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured as he finally exited the deep space, quickly scanning his surroundings to find he was not far from Epochal Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment but ultimately decided against entering Epochal Divine Peak to check on whether the Creation Herald was dead or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take care of the Creation Herald when I'm stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne activated interdimensional travel, making his way back to Hudson Valley!</span></p><div class="pagination">
