  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne settled comfortably into the seat, turning to Tristan with a grin. "This spot is perfect! I'll take it. Thanks for giving me the good seat, Tristan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan blinked, momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was incredulous as he stared at Osborne. Did he just say he was given this seat? No, he hadn't willingly ceded it. He'd been forced out by Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Baxter family was powerful, and Kurt's status was far superior to his&mdash;Kurt's father was a Supernal Deity King. Tristan couldn't afford to offend him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here was Osborne, claiming the seat was offered to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan mused, "What a way to save face for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who is this guy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How does he dare to push Kurt aside and take that seat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't he worried about Kurt's retaliation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan frowned, studying Osborne's face closely, a nagging feeling of familiarity creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had seen him somewhere before, but he couldn't quite place it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, Osborne's boldness in standing up to Kurt sparked an unexpected appreciation within Tristan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as he glanced at Kurt's darkening expression, concern for Osborne began to creep in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tristan was about to speak, Kurt's icy voice cut through the tension in the room, dropping the temperature by several degrees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fury was palpable, and everyone could sense the threat looming in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you looking for a death wish?" Kurt snarled, his divine power crackling around him, ready to unleash chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, remained unfazed, his demeanor calm and collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled at Kurt, unbothered by the hostility. "What are you doing standing there? You're blocking my view. Move aside, will you? If you're not careful, people might mistake you for my bodyguard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's anger flared even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blocking your view? I'm your bodyguard?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can just waltz in and take my spot? Tristan, the scion of the Hudson family, had to scurry off with his tail between his legs just to make way for me, and you think you can just take it from me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you three seconds to get up and get out, or I'll make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was thick with tension, Kurt's murderous intent echoing off the walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted in rage. It had been ages since someone had dared to confront him like this. The Hudson family had fallen from grace, and its members had learned to keep their heads down, avoiding conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, this unknown nobody had the audacity to challenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just about a position. This was a slap in his face! A slap in the face of the Baxter family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was so furious at this moment that he felt like tearing Osborne apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, remained unruffled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take your spot? How does that work? Is there a nameplate on this seat with your name on it? Tristan here gave it to me! What gives you the right to tell me to get lost? Who do you think you are?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you've got the guts, go ahead and make a move. If you don't, then you're just my little grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So why don't you step aside and stop blocking my view?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, the entire room fell silent, jaws dropping in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of Kurt's boiling rage, Osborne had the audacity to keep provoking him. The words he threw at Kurt were enough to make even the usual arrogant bully lose his patience, and everyone in the room was holding their breath, waiting to see what Kurt would do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he actually lay a hand on Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were on Kurt as he clenched his fists, the veins in his neck bulging as he fought to stay composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His rational thought was drowning in fury, and he was ready to pounce on Osborne and teach him a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to strike, a group quickly rushed in to restrain him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter, calm down! Stay calm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This punk is deliberately provoking you! He wants to get under your skin and force you to make a move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, this is the Luminous Commerce Center!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you throw a punch here, the consequences will be serious! The Sanctum of Light won't take it lightly. This idiot is trying to set you up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter, please cool off! Wait until he leaves the Luminous Commerce Center, and then deal with him! He won't get away, trust me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Kurt's anger began to subside, the urgency of their words sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed Osborne with a blazing glare, his anger simmering just below the surface. "Fine, fine, fine! You country bumpkin, consider yourself done for! You've made a mistake in provoking me. The moment you step out of the Luminous Commerce Center, I'll be the one to snap your neck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll see about that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a huff, Kurt stormed over to the far end of the front row, plopping down with a scowl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't done with Kurt yet. "Pathetic! What a coward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because you're the so-called scion of the Baxter family doesn't mean you're anything but a scared little wimp! I thought you might actually stand up for yourself, but look at you, running scared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not only did he back down, but he's still throwing empty threats! How ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to deliberately taunt Kurt, and his words struck like a match to gasoline, instantly reigniting Kurt's fury.</span></p><div class="pagination">
