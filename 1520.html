  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't hide his astonishment. "Wait, the Artisan Institute got the technology for the Malevolence Airship directly from the Divine Peak?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And not just that; a lot of technology comes from the Divine Peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, despite the constant danger from Deathborns cutting down Deity King warriors up there, skilled fighters still flock to explore it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly could be hiding in the divine peak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah shook her head, her brow furrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one knows! Not even Lord Malevolence, the God of Light, or the God of Night&mdash;none of the top warriors have any answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What we do know for sure is that the Deathborn originate from various divine peaks, and there's a massive secret buried within them. Anyone who can unlock that mystery might just change everything for Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, it's no easy feat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah continued, lightening her tone, "Enough with the heavy stuff! While it's not top-secret, it's not something you should go blabbing about to the Human Community. Just keep it to yourself, alright?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And please don't get any wild ideas about storming the divine peak looking for Ultimate Essence Crystals or Celestial Crystals or whatever tech is hidden in there! That's a sure way to get yourself killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The divine peak is incredibly dangerous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, you're part of the Wild Flame Army. With your recent power boost, you're probably due for a promotion soon, right? If things look bad at Divine Peak Nine, the Wild Flame Army will likely send in reinforcements, and you might just find yourself deploying there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frown creased Hannah's forehead as she added, "When that happens, be careful out there! The divine peak is no joke, and since you're from the Human Community, with so many enemies around, you could easily end up as collateral damage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's demeanor grew serious, nodding resolutely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for the warning, Hannah. I'll take your advice to heart! If it comes down to it and I do have a chance to go to Divine Peak Nine, I'll be extra cautious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah replied, "Good to hear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, we're approaching the Gellar family's Essence Crystal mining area! The Gellar family members and the hired Human Community miners have already evacuated. Let's clear out the Deathborn here and figure out why there's been such a spike in their numbers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Malevolence Airship hovered in mid-air, allowing Osborne and Hannah to peer down at the quiet expanse of Zone 8.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Gellar family's mining territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you want to handle this?" Osborne asked, looking at the eerily silent site below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's cheeks flushed slightly, stumbling for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it," Osborne said with a chuckle, realizing she didn't have a set plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Well, you're at the pinnacle of Celestial Deity, and I'm at Celestial Deity level, too. We don't have to worry about most Deathborns. Plus, your powers can perfectly mask our life signs, meaning even if the Deathborn are right in front of us, they won't sense our presence and won't attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That should keep us safe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should stow the Malevolence Airship for now and head down to gather intel on the Deathborn's presence in the mine. If it looks like a typical situation, we'll strike quickly to clear them out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded vigorously. "Sounds good, I'm with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Hannah retracted the Malevolence Airship, enveloping them in a cloak of black mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay close to me, okay? I can only mask our life signs effectively if we're this close. If you stray too far, we might alert the Deathborn, and we really don't want them coming after us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem, I'll stick right by your side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he took another deep breath, musing to himself how wonderful Hannah's scent was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face flushed again, and she quickly turned away, feigning casualness as she gazed in another direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they arrived at the entrance of a vast mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the main shaft! Through here, we can reach the deepest parts of the mine," Hannah announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head inside, then," Osborne replied, nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Hannah's ability to conceal their life energies, they felt a sense of security as they swiftly moved through the main tunnel, delving deeper into the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they hadn't gone far before they had to come to an abrupt halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of them congregated a massive horde of Deathborns drifting like restless spirits within the cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were easily hundreds of them, with more lurking deeper in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least among those in view, every last one was at least of Superior Deity rank, and many boasted Transcendent Deity-level strength as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, they didn't spot any Celestial Deities among the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the sight of so many powerful foes made Hannah's skin crawl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on the other hand, seemed electrified, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This is exactly what I came for! With this many Deathborns around, if I take them all out, there's a real shot at fully restoring the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
