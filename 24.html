  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Godfather&rsquo;s successor&rsquo;s test was never going to be easy</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> Osborne pondered.<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Clarissa&rsquo;s status was so noble that even the heads of wealthy families couldn&rsquo;t win her favor. To get close to her, to stay by her side, using ordinary methods was simply impossible</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He then stroked his chin, thinking about what to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whether he could complete the successor&rsquo;s test determined whether Anastasia&rsquo;s illness could be cured. No matter how difficult the test, Osborne would try his best to complete it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, he had to get close to Clarissa and stay by her side within three days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But in what capacity should I stay by her side?</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Osborne then wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t come up with a plan right away, so he chose to do nothing and just observe for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, Debbe suddenly clapped her hands and announced, &ldquo;Alright, everyone, Ms. Radcliffe doesn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed. Please step aside. Our charity auction is about to start. Ms. Radcliffe has also donated an item for the auction, which will be up for bidding soon to raise funds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe has requested the specific item remain a secret. Whoever is lucky enough to win the bid on Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s item will have a luncheon with her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once Debbe finished speaking, everyone gasped in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe actually donated an item for the auction? If we win the bid, we can have lunch with her?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh my, I have to win this!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s item will be mine. No one should even think of competing with me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how much it costs. I&rsquo;m getting it!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All the big shots were now gearing up, eager to bid on Clarissa&rsquo;s item and win the opportunity to dine with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, no one knew what her item was, so they had to spend more money bidding on multiple items to increase their chances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One could imagine that this charity auction would raise several times more funds than usual, and that was exactly Clarissa&rsquo;s goal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at Clarissa&rsquo;s calm face and felt a bit of admiration for her. She was indeed a very capable and kind-hearted woman.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon after, the charity auction began. Clarissa sat at the front, with everyone trying to get close to her, while Osborne sat in the farthest corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one was around him, making him look lonely, in stark contrast to the lively scene near Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia had also wanted to sit close to Clarissa but couldn&rsquo;t find a seat, so they retreated and sat near Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Debbe soon walked onto the stage with a smile and said, &ldquo;Thank you all for taking the time to attend the charity auction held by Draco Auction House. This charity auction aims to raise funds to help orphans who have lost their parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Draco Auction House promises that all the funds raised will be handed over to the Draco Charitable Foundation, and every penny&rsquo;s allocation will be transparent and public.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Debbe finished speaking, sparse applause sounded in the venue. It wasn&rsquo;t until Clarissa began to clap that the applause became overwhelmingly loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne felt a bit lost. Raising funds to help orphans who have lost their parents?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He felt a bit touched because he was an orphan himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley then looked at Osborne and sneered, &ldquo;Loser, I heard you were also an orphan. Then you must be very generous, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne glanced at Wesley and ignored him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll cut to the chase. Now we&rsquo;ll begin the charity auction with the first item, a handcrafted piece donated by Starlight Orphanage,&rdquo; Debbe introduced the item, and the bidding immediately began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I bid 20 thousand dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I bid 50 thousand dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The items in a charity auction usually weren&rsquo;t very valuable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The first item was a child&rsquo;s butterfly ornament that looked somewhat old and worn. Its actual value probably wasn&rsquo;t even a hundred dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But someone mentioned that Clarissa seemed to have worn a similar piece before, and suddenly, all the prominent figures present began bidding frantically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The accessory, originally worth only a few dozen dollars, ended up being auctioned off for a million dollars. Osborne was a bit stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A million dollars was an amount that an ordinary person could hardly attain, no matter how hard they worked. But for these big shots, it was like spending a hundred dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne then couldn&rsquo;t resist taking a look at Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had underestimated Clarissa&rsquo;s influence. Without her promise of having lunch together, this butterfly ornament would be lucky to fetch ten thousand dollars. Now, its price had increased a hundredfold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that in mind, Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but feel thankful to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was an orphan himself and knew well how tough life was for those without parents. He appreciated any effort to help those like him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The charity auction continued with fierce competition. Each item was fiercely contested by the big shots of Mayby City, except for those that clearly couldn&rsquo;t have been provided by Clarissa, which saw a sudden lack of interest. Even so, their prices still exceeded ten thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In a short amount of time, this charity auction had raised over ten million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, Wesley spoke up again, mocking, &ldquo;Ha! Still not making a move yet, loser?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at Osborne disdainfully and continued, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an orphan, too. I thought you&rsquo;d have some sympathy for other orphans. I didn&rsquo;t expect you not to bid even once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I definitely gave you too much credit, loser.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
