  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying you want to merge with me?!" Osborne exclaimed, a rush of excitement and unease coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had often fantasized about merging with an entity like the World Tree offshoot, much like the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though this was just the ninth and presumably weakest offshoot, it still held immense potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could even bring it up, Primordial had gone ahead and proposed the fusion themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Osborne possibly turn that down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Primordial spoke up, "Osborne, I think there's a misunderstanding here. My merging with you is different from how the Lotus merged with you. It became a part of you, almost like an extension of your being, and once merged, it's permanent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, my merging with you is more of a soul fusion. Once I am powerful enough, I can sever this connection. This fusion is temporary, aimed at utilizing your Soul Current Ocean to accelerate my growth and to evade the other eight offshoots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I ever become powerful enough to no longer fear them and perhaps even absorb them, I will separate from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, processing this information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're saying that our fusion is more about souls, and once you're strong enough, you can leave my Soul Current Ocean at will?" he inquired, seeking clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's correct!" Primordial affirmed with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's brow furrowed further. "What's in it for me? It seems like I'm just being used as a tool for your growth, and once you're done, you'll discard me?" There was a hint of apprehension in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial hastened to reassure him, "On the contrary, you will reap significant benefits from this union.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, you might gain more than I do. For instance, merging our souls will not only expedite my growth but also yours. The rate at which your soul power increases will surpass anything you've imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, once I enter your Soul Current Ocean, I'll naturally begin reshaping your body. I can make it transcend the limitations of this world, making it far stronger than it is now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To me, your current body is too frail, and your strength is too weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As an offshoot of the World Tree, I inherit its vast power and potential. I can make your body as powerful as mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words were laced with confidence, but Osborne remained skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all? You're an offshoot of the World Tree, yet the benefits you're offering seem less substantial compared to what the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity has given me. It not only allowed me to transform the Blood Clan but also granted me immortality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Primordial chuckled. "Immortality? You're being naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Lotus hasn't granted you true immortality&mdash;not even close!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked in concern, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied, "The immortality the Lotus granted you is only applicable at your current level. If you were to face higher-tiered beings and get injured beyond repair, the Lotus' power wouldn't be able to resurrect you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, if you merge with me, I might be able to bestow upon you a more powerful immortality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in astonishment. "You can make me immortal? Even more so than what the Lotus has already done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial said, "No, I can't grant true immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can make the Lotus within you evolve, making it much stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the Lotus grows more powerful, your immortality will naturally become more potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While true immortality is impossible in this world&mdash; even the World Tree eventually perished&mdash;I can promise that, with my help, the Lotus will become the second most powerful being, right after the World Tree. By then, very few things will be able to truly kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words lit up Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne could feel the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within him vibrating intensely, as if it, too, was incredibly excited and eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to be urging Osborne to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly asked, "Primordial, can you really help the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity evolve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied confidently, "Of course! But at my current strength, it's not possible yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to help me grow stronger! The stronger I become, the more it can evolve. If you help me merge and absorb the other eight offshoots of the World Tree, I can even make it evolve into a being almost as powerful as myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Consider it, Osborne. Will you merge with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you refuse, I'll have to leave and find another host."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing quickened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merge? Or not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merging with Primordial would undoubtedly boost his own power and give the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity a chance to evolve further. But it would also come with greater risks.</span></p><div class="pagination">
