  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity trembling violently within his body, as if gripped by sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cracks began to spread across the surface of his Divine Body, and blood started to ooze out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne's Divine Body had reached the pinnacle of Level Nine, it couldn't withstand the Lotus' intense quaking. After all, the Lotus was a Cosmic Treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why is a Cosmic Treasure cowering in fear?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of existence could be lurking in the shadows, watching us?" Osborne wondered, a chill running down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even the mightiest Deity King warriors could harm the Lotus; in a sense, it was truly indestructible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, the Lotus was gripped by terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever's out there must be far more powerful than a Deity King. What on earth is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced, and suddenly, a thought that wasn't his own bubbled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, Osborne realized this mental plea was coming from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all this time, he'd assumed the Lotus was mindless, but now he saw it had its own consciousness, and it was urging him to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne began a frantic escape through the spatial tide. Although he had no sense of direction in this deep realm, he just needed to get as far away as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his space elemental essence nearing its peak at Level Six, he darted through the currents at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the sense of dread and the feeling of being watched never left him, only growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lotus trembled more violently, the shockwaves rippling through Osborne's Divine Body, causing it to crack and bleed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already been injured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for his Divine Body being at Level Nine, the violent tremors from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would have shattered his Divine Body into oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted in his mind, his expression grave, "Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, calm down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where should we run?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Lotus gave no response; its only message was a relentless mantra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Run! Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could palpably feel the Lotus' panic and terror, which stunned him. He couldn't fathom what kind of being could inspire such fear in a Cosmic Treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be the Lotus' ancient nemesis?" he wondered, brows furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's knowledge, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was a Cosmic Treasure that had existed since well before the Big Bang. Its seed had emerged from an ocean of chaos, and as the universe exploded into existence, the Lotus wandered through the starry expanse, absorbing cosmic power and growing stronger with time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Lotus had any arch-rival, it wouldn't be a mere living creature. No being could possibly match the Lotus' age-old vitality, a life span that stretched back to the dawn of the cosmos itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant whatever instilled such fear in the Lotus was likely another Cosmic Treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It should be one that could counteract it, even consume it entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization tightened the knot of dread in Osborne's stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who had encountered treasures like the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity could truly appreciate their power. A single surge of its energy could obliterate a planet, wipe out a solar system, or even annihilate an entire world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It trembled only slightly from fear, but Osborne's Level Nine Divine Body was on the brink of collapse, cracking under the strain&mdash;a testament to its formidable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unseen presence, likely a Cosmic Treasure more formidable than the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, sent shivers down Osborne's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Run! Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The desperate thoughts from the Lotus flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already poured every ounce of his energy into fleeing, yet the eerie sensation of being watched persisted, growing even closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt the Lotus make a new move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that Osborne's speed was insufficient to escape, it erupted with an immense force, brutally injecting itself into Osborne's body, seizing control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body shot forward at tenfold, a hundredfold speed, blurring into an illusion in the deep spatial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, such power and velocity came at a horrific cost. Osborne spurted blood, his Divine Body unable to withstand the strain, cracking further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even worse, the Lotus had no time to repair his damaged body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Osborne cried out, his body under immense pressure from the Lotus' forced control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Continuing like this would shatter his very existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Lotus showed no sign of stopping, unleashing a frenzied burst of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, abruptly, Osborne felt the world go dark.</span></p><div class="pagination">
