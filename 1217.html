  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze was fixed on the thirty-six figures before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was crowned with flickering Divine Flames, but the strongest among them, Joseph, had four flames dancing above his head, radiating a vibrant green glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, among those flames, only three blazed brightly; the fourth flickered dimly, still unlit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, his heart racing, "Remarkable... a Transcendent Deity warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he hasn't fully regained his strength yet&mdash;he's only at the Superior Deity level for now. Still, that green flame signifies he possesses a Level Four Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Superior Deity with a Level Four Divine Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his confidence, he was still just a Junior Deity. Facing even a basic Superior Deity was a daunting prospect, let alone Joseph, who was truly a Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they clashed, he had no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't just Joseph. There were thirty-five other Deschanel family gods around him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty Intermediate Deities and five Superior Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them have Level Two Divine Bodies, with a few at Level Three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped, overwhelmed by the sheer strength of the assembly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, the Deschanel family boasted thirty-six gods, none of whom were Junior Deities. With Joseph included, they had six Superior Deities in their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magnitude of their power was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Descendants of the Deschanel family, we pay our respects to our ancestors! We wish you strength as you awaken!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voices of thousands of family members echoed in the chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph raised a hand, a gesture of calm authority. "Everyone, rise! We owe our swift recovery to your efforts. The other elders, stronger than I, will need more time to regain their strength. You don't need to wait here any longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, gratitude surged through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thousands of Deschanel family members finally stood, and save for Damian and a few high-ranking members, they began to leave the underground sanctuary, making their way back to the Deschanel Estate above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, remained hidden in the parallel space, his curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the thirty-six Deschanel gods was immense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered what their next move would be&mdash;would they pose a threat to Newport City and the Augustine family? Would they come after him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian stepped forward, his voice respectful. "Ancestors, we're currently under attack from the Beast Tide, which is being stirred up by the Dark Deities. They're bloodthirsty and brutal, slaughtering our cities. Should we intervene?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph smiled at the question, saying, "Now that we've awakened, the surviving Dark Deities will surely stir as well. Their rampage through the cities is likely a means to regain their strength quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will intervene, but there's no need to rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're just mortals, after all. If they die, so be it. Let the Dark Deities instill fear and despair. When we finally step in to save them, they'll be grateful, worship us even."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Joseph spoke, the other Deschanel family gods nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian hesitated for a moment but ultimately followed suit. "Understood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, Joseph's voice took on a nostalgic tone as he began to recount the storied past of his clan, "Back in the Age of Gods, the Deschanel Clan was a formidable force. At our peak, we boasted a staggering 100 thousand deities! Our clan </span><span>leader, Terrence Deschanel, was a top-tier Deity Overlord warrior, feared and respected across entire realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then came the cataclysm. Lord Malevolence led an army of Dark Deities to invade Celestara, unleashing horrors that shattered the very fabric of our world. Countless gods perished in that onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan barely escaped annihilation, thanks to a stroke of luck that gifted us a hundred Sanctuary Caskets. Yet from that moment on, Celestara was suffocated by a thick scent of death, rendering it uninhabitable. Terrence, our leader, made the fateful decision to lead a hundred of our kin into the Sanctuary Caskets to sleep until the world was fit for life again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We slumbered for a millennium, while the outside world, under the relentless march of the God of Time, endured eons of change. Now, at last, the world has stabilized!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks to your efforts, we've regained our strength and awakened swiftly! But we have one singular purpose. To seize this new world before the other clans awaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will claim its resources and establish the Deschanel Clan as the supreme power once more! We will rise to heights even greater than before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, a cold resolve ignited in his eyes, a spark of ambition that ignited the spirits of the thirty-five Deschanel family gods behind him. They stood ready, their resolve palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph declared, his voice thunderous, "The Deschanel Clan will rule this new world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of the new age's humans must bow to us! They will become our vassals, our servants! Those who refuse? They'll meet their end!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
