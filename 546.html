  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family, Challenge Peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the afternoon, Challenge Peak became very lively. Almost all nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family who were in Newport City rushed here, waiting for the competition to begin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even many people from the main bloodline came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A huge curtain had been lowered in the center of the Arena Number Two on Challenge Peak. Because the competition had not officially started yet, the images on the curtain were some documentaries about the terrain of the Lostridge Mountains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Led by Isaac, the members of the branch bloodline in Dampston also came to Arena Number Two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this time, the good viewing positions were already occupied, so they could only stand in the corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a teasing voice sounded. "These people are from the ninth branch bloodline of the Augustine family, the Dampston branch. You're here too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone else said sarcastically, "I heard that your branch bloodline only sent one person to participate in the competition. That's hilarious. Doesn't the Augustine family in Dampston have any talent? It's embarrassing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Nathan and others were furious and wanted to refute but were stopped by Isaac.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac looked over and found that they were people from the Clifford branch bloodline and the Narciso branch bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people from these two branch bloodlines looked at them with displeasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac knew the reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long ago, Osborne defeated the heirs of these two branch bloodlines, John and Henry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac smiled, "We did send only one person to participate, but I think it is enough. At least, he will not get the last or second to last place. That should be your position."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing these words, the people from the two branch bloodlines became angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac was mocking them because they got last and second to last place in the last competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Isaac felt that they were still the last and second to last this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are so arrogant!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You only sent one person to participate, so the last place is destined to be yours. Let's wait and see!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac snorted and ignored them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he found that everyone present seemed to be looking at them with contempt and disdain in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac frowned but said nothing in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything was based on strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family, the weakest one was the Dampston branch bloodline. If it weren't for Osborne, they wouldn't even be qualified to come here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I hope Osborne can get a good result.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although there is almost no chance for him to get the top two. With Osborne's means and strength, he will not be last."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac trusted Osborne very much for his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Isaac felt a cold and terrifying gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression changed as he looked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he saw Owen walking in slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Surrounded by a group of main bloodline members, Owen walked in slowly. The Heir's Emblem was hanging on his chest. Everyone made way for him to walk to the front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is the future heir Owen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't expect he is here too. Is he also interested in the Branch Bloodline Competition?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I guess he came to see Lance's performance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Many people say that Lance from the Yalynch is as strong as Owen and Emma, and he is destined to stand out and become the future heir. He will become Owen's competitor soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Owen must want to see Lance's strength and prepare for the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was talking in low voices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing these words, Owen showed a look of disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt a little unhappy. Was Lance worthy of being his competitor?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He came here just to see how Osborne would be punished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's started!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the crowd made an excited noise, and images began to appear on the projection screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the screen, Caleb and the heirs of nine branch bloodlines were in a narrow helicopter. Caleb was showing them the Heir's Emblem and announcing the rules.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They are fighting for the Heir's Emblem?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Two people will be the first to get the emblem?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lucky guys? Haha. I think the first two are the unlucky guys. They will be eliminated if they lose the emblem. Except Lance, who can keep the emblem?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The picture kept flashing. Isaac, Nathan, and others watched it carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they saw that Caleb threw the second emblem to Osborne, they were all stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their faces all turned ugly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems that luck is not on our side. Osborne has become the 'unlucky guy'. There is no hope now. Osborne will be targeted by everyone. He will most likely be the first to be eliminated."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan, Yulissa, and Queenie were also desperate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that was the rule, and there was nothing they could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They could only pray that Osborne could hold on longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as he came back safely, that was enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people from other branch bloodlines looked at them with mockery and ridicule.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne is finished."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He doesn't have any help. Now he is the unlucky guy, and he will be hunted and targeted by more than a hundred people. How can he possibly keep the emblem?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The most ridiculous thing is that he dared to provoke Sam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is courting death!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He will be beaten to death by Sam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne must be the last place. People from the Dampston branch bloodline can go back to sleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Owen showed a sneer when he saw Osborne provoking Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This brat is doomed."</p><div class="pagination">
