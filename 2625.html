  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, her power erupted. Everyone instantly felt an immense pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They suddenly panicked, unable to calm down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are too strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, they were at the same cultivation level as Seraphina. Moreover, when facing Seraphina, they had no fighting spirit in their hearts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Seraphina's cultivation level is already much higher than theirs, and not just by a little. They have only just reached primary Empyrean Sacredness, while Seraphina is nearing advanced Empyrean Sacredness. In such a situation, how could they possibly oppose Seraphina?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if they join forces, it might still be difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knows that the current situation is vastly different from before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, Osborne was able to defeat Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, everyone knows Osborne is the champion of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. He defeated Seraphina, and his strength was greater than hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, with Seraphina advancing to mid Empyrean Sacredness, Osborne can no longer suppress her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the other five princes and princesses have also advanced to mid Empyrean Sacredness. Even if their strength isn't as great as Seraphina's, they aren't far behind. At the very least, Seraphina is far beyond their reach.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, based on the current situation, Seraphina can already take control of real power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The six princes and princesses of the royal family can also make decisions now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am willing to follow Princess Seraphina's leadership!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, someone couldn't bear the pressure and said, "Princess Seraphina is the strongest, and she's much stronger than us, so she deserves to lead us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone echoed, "Princess Seraphina is not only the strongest but also the most familiar with Celestial Spire. With her leadership, we can pass each level of Celestial Spire better and faster to obtain the key to the Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I agree too! With Princess Seraphina's leadership, I will feel more at ease!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I agree too..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone present began to express their agreement to accept Seraphina's leadership and follow her orders in the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, most people expressed their stance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Seraphina smiled brightly, very pleased with it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Clara, Leroy, and Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they all watched indifferently, without indicating they would follow her orders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina gave a faint smile and said, "Osborne, what about you three? If you want to progress through the Celestial Spire and reach higher levels, you can only follow my orders."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered upon hearing this and said, "Why? Why should I follow the orders of someone I've defeated? Just because your cultivation level is higher than mine? Sorry, even if your cultivation level is higher, I couldn't care less. I don't mind if others are willing to follow your orders, but I won't. You're not worthy of ordering me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think we should split into two teams."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne calmly finished speaking, Seraphina's expression immediately turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she could speak, Matthew coldly said behind her, "Osborne, you're too arrogant!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can't you see the situation clearly?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew looked disdainful and arrogant. "Now, all six of us royal members have reached mid Empyrean Sacredness, but you've only reached primary Empyrean Sacredness. What do you think you are? How dare you talk to us like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you really think we don't dare to kill you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Prince Matthew took out a Supreme Sacred Artifact, a dagger, his eyes filled with ferocity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel stage, I lost to you, but now my cultivation level is higher than yours. I really want to see if you'd dare fight me again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Prince Matthew's entire being erupted with terrifying killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "You want to fight me here? Are you sure? Do you think reaching mid Empyrean Sacredness guarantees your victory and revenge against me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since that's the case, bring it on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After calmly finishing his words, Osborne hooked his finger at Prince Matthew, looking very provocative.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prince Matthew instantly became even fiercer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clenched his teeth, ready to start the fight immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Seraphina stopped him and said through Telepathy, "Don't do that! In this Celestial Spire, even if you kill him, it&rsquo;s useless; he&rsquo;ll just be teleported out of the Celestial Spire. Besides, even if he&rsquo;s only reached primary Empyrean Sacredness, his strength is formidable. You might not be his match."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Prince Matthew snorted coldly, "We&rsquo;ll only know after we fight. Besides, are we just going to let him be? He&rsquo;s too arrogant. I just want to teach him a harsh lesson right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina said calmly, "If you want to teach him a lesson, why rush? You should first get the key to the Skyfall Casket. Deal with him after you leave the Celestial Spire."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In any case, he&rsquo;s doomed! There&rsquo;s no way he can leave Necropolis City..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prince Matthew's eyes lit up immediately upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He snorted coldly at Osborne, "Osborne, just wait! Once you leave the Celestial Spire, I&rsquo;ll definitely deal with you properly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he stepped back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina continued, "Osborne, it seems you've decided not to accept my leadership, and you&rsquo;re unwilling to act with us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you want to split into two teams, I won't force you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for what happened here, I will truthfully inform the seniors outside. I didn't expect you to be so impulsive. If you delay us from obtaining the key to the Skyfall Casket, the seniors outside won't spare you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina smiled coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't need to worry!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "I don't think your team will necessarily get the key to the Skyfall Casket. Maybe I'll get it first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, let's wait and see."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina looked at Osborne with disdain. Unwilling to waste more time with him, she said, "Those willing to follow my lead, leave with me now. I'm very familiar with the first few levels of the Celestial Spire, so I can guide you through quickly and reach the higher levels!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, if you assist me in obtaining the key to the Skyfall Casket, the royal family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom will not forget your contributions. By then, anyone who helps me will receive generous rewards..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, everyone's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We are willing to follow Princess Seraphina!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We all agree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina smiled and said, "Alright, those willing, follow me. We need to hurry. Those unwilling can stay with Osborne and court death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina cast a cold glance at Osborne and turned to walk deeper into the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others quickly followed Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some of them glanced at Osborne with mocking and sarcastic eyes before leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, most people followed Seraphina and left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only four people remained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides Osborne, Clara, and Leroy, one more person chose not to follow Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Casey stay behind, Osborne was immediately surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Casey, aren't you going with them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The others all followed Princess Seraphina to clear the challenge. There are over fifty of them, including six at mid Empyrean Sacredness. Joining them would make it easier for you to succeed and obtain the Skyfall Casket key."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you help Princess Seraphina get the key, the Glorious Divine Kingdom will reward you generously!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey smiled immediately upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not going! I don't trust Princess Seraphina. Compared to her, I trust you more!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, from now on, you can't leave me behind!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
