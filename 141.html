  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's body jolted, and she suddenly stopped in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Osborne, lightly biting her lips, and asked with a touch of displeasure, "Could you stop calling me Ms. Radcliffe, Osborne? Ever since you saved me fifteen years ago, I've considered you the dearest person to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though you're my chief bodyguard, I've never seen you as just an employee. But you keep addressing me as Ms. Radcliffe, which upsets me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? You're upset because of this?" Osborne awkwardly touched his nose. He had assumed that Clarissa was upset because of her fianc&eacute;, but now he saw he had misunderstood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa parted her lips as if to say something but ended up saying nothing. She then took a deep breath as if to calm herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She responded, "Yes, I'm upset because of that. So, can you call me something else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled awkwardly, "What should I call you? I'm worried Ms. Donna Radcliffe might not be happy if I don't call you Ms. Radcliffe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should you care about her?" Clarissa raised her voice. "This is between you and me. Aunt Donna has no say in it! From now on, just call me Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but then nodded. "Alright, Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face then instantly lit up with a dazzling smile, making the vibrant flowers in the garden seem faded and dull in her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself staring again. He couldn't deny that he indeed liked her, although his feelings for her were mostly driven by her beauty. She was simply too stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he gazed at Clarissa's face, he couldn't help but feel his heart racing uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she sensed Osborne's intense gaze on her, her cheeks turned rosy, but instead of disliking it, she felt a thrill of joy. She didn't shy away from his intense look but met it earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression seemed filled with a complex array of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, an odd and ambiguous tension began to build between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a light cough sounded, disrupting the tension between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, like a startled rabbit, quickly averted her gaze, her expression turning cold again as she continued to walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on the other hand, touched his nose awkwardly, still unable to calm his wildly beating heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should go take a break, Osborne," Donna said calmly. "Clarissa isn't leaving the manor anytime soon. Just make sure the bodyguards are well-organized. You don't need to follow her all the time. After all, you're a man. It's enough for her to have me by her side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne detected a cold edge in her tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, he nodded. "Alright. I'll organize the bodyguard team well. If anything comes up, Ms. Donna Radcliffe, you can contact me, and I'll come back right away." With that, he turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning that Clarissa was engaged, Osborne finally understood why Donna was wary of him, worried that he might have ulterior motives toward Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Donna didn't want him to accompany Clarissa, he gladly took the opportunity to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, having organized the bodyguards, promptly left Radcliffe Manor and headed back to the Institute of Human Research to see how Anastasia was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing that Anastasia was doing well under Isa's care, Osborne felt relieved, thinking Isa was as reliable as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Isa's help, he wouldn't have easily completed the third successor test. Therefore, he thought, "I should find an opportunity to thank her properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Isa came to mind, Osborne suddenly recalled their last kiss. He then couldn't help but touch his lips, savoring the memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered to himself, "Back then, Isa had said that I could buy her for 100 million dollars and have her do anything I wanted. And I actually turned it down? If I had known, I would have taken the offer. Now hiring her for just one job costs 20 million dollars, and that's even at a friend's rate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed with a rueful smile, regretting his decision. The most frustrating part was that spending 20 million dollars was just for hiring her help. It didn't cover anything else. It indeed was a huge loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then understood why Isa had said back then that he would surely regret it later. Now, even if he wanted to spend 10 billion dollars to buy her, it would be out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne regretted it because Isa was not only a reliable partner and a powerful ally but also a very attractive woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he thought about it, 100 million dollars seemed too low for her worth, and he might even be willing to pay 10 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly shook his head, pushing the idea out of his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder when my fourth successor's test will begin," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, his Draco Star Wristlet started vibrating. His expression shifted, thinking it was the start of his fourth successor's test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hurriedly checked, only to find it was a video call. He wondered, "A strange number is video calling me through the Draco Star Wristlet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, his expression turned serious, and he quickly clicked to accept the call. The next second, an elderly figure appeared on the screen, sitting on a cushy gray sofa and cradling a jet-black cat. The person had his hair slicked back and was donned in a black suit with a black bow tie, looking every bit the gentleman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person was none other than the Godfather. Osborne's biological grandfather, the Godfather, had contacted Osborne once again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
