  <div class="container"><p>A radiant light quickly enveloped Rhett&#x27;s body, and his injuries started healing remarkably.</p><p>Although his wounds were severe, under the powerful effect of the Light of Redemption, they were nothing. In no time, Rhett&#x27;s body was restored to its original state.</p><p>Slowly, Rhett opened his eyes.</p><p>&quot;What... what happened to me?&quot;</p><p>Rhett muttered in confusion, as the images of the battle on the stage rushed back into his mind. Instantly, his expression darkened with rage, and he clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>Seeing that he had recovered, Osborne withdrew his Light Realm.</p><p>He had used the Light Realm because casting the Light of Redemption within it consumed much less energy. Without it, casting the Light of Redemption would mean waiting half an hour before being able to use it again.</p><p>But now, in just a minute, he could cast it again if necessary.</p><p>Osborne&#x27;s face remained icy cold.</p><p>He knew he would face Cuthbert Williamson next, and the Holy Light of Redemption would be crucial to winning.</p><p>Cuthbert&#x27;s strength was formidable, and Osborne wasn&#x27;t confident of victory. Initially, he had planned to engage briefly, trade a few moves, and intentionally lose.</p><p>But after what happened to Rhett, Osborne was determined to take this fight seriously.</p><p>Cuthbert had humiliated and seriously injured Rhett. Osborne couldn&#x27;t let this go unpunished.</p><p>&quot;Aleena, you and Rhett should stay here. His quick recovery shouldn&#x27;t be revealed,&quot; Osborne said.</p><p>Aleena hesitated but then nodded. &quot;Alright, we&#x27;ll stay hidden. But be careful. By the rules, you have to fight Cuthbert on stage. He&#x27;ll come at you just like he did Rhett, so make sure you surrender quickly.&quot;</p><p>Osborne smiled faintly. &quot;Surrender, huh? Don&#x27;t worry. I know what to do.&quot;</p><p>With that, Osborne turned and left the courtyard.</p><p>Back at the arena, the Honor Quest Ceremony continued. Despite Cuthbert severely injuring Rhett, more challengers stepped up, although fewer than before.</p><p>&quot;Anyone else want to challenge me?&quot;</p><p>After defeating another opponent with two moves, Cuthbert casually said, &quot;If not, then it&#x27;s time for the Godson Rankings challengers.&quot;</p><p>At this point, Cuthbert had achieved twenty-nine consecutive victories.</p><p>His energy remained strong and powerful. Of the twenty-nine challengers, none had drained much of his strength. In fact, Rhett had taken the most out of him.</p><p>To seriously injure Rhett, he had expended more effort than defeating the others.</p><p>But to him, it was nothing.</p><p>Cuthbert was still at his peak.</p><p>One more victory, and he would achieve a thirty-win streak. It&#x27;s considered a solid performance.</p><p>But for Cuthbert, this was just the beginning.</p><p>Up to now, he hadn&#x27;t even used his Domain power.</p><p>&quot;No more challengers?</p><p>&quot;Then, let those from the Godson Rankings begin,&quot; Cuthbert said casually.</p><p>&quot;Wait a minute!</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m still challenging you!&quot;</p><p>Just then, a sharp voice rang out. Emma stood up, slowly walking toward the stage.</p><p>Stuart and Vivian were both stunned.</p><p>They quickly grabbed her. &quot;Emma, what are you doing? You can&#x27;t challenge him! Have you forgotten what happened to Rhett? Cuthbert is targeting us. You&#x27;ll end up just like him!&quot; Vivian said in a panic.</p><p>Stuart also urged, &quot;That&#x27;s right, Emma. Don&#x27;t act recklessly. We need to avenge Rhett, but now&#x27;s not the time. Cuthbert&#x27;s too strong for us.&quot;</p><p>Emma responded with a calm smile. &quot;No need to convince me. I&#x27;ve already made up my mind. I&#x27;ll regret it if I don&#x27;t challenge him at an event like this.</p><p>&quot;Cuthbert is targeting us? Will he injure me, too?</p><p>&quot;Hmph, let&#x27;s see him try!&quot;</p><p>With that, Emma broke free from the two and quickly headed for the stage.</p><p>Her sudden action left the onlookers stunned.</p><p>&quot;Is that girl from the Lambert family insane? She knows Cuthbert is targeting them, and she&#x27;s still going up there? Does she think being a woman will make him go easy on her?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She&#x27;s lost her mind!&quot;</p><p>&quot;She&#x27;s done for!&quot;</p><p>The crowd murmured, pitying Emma. The six from the Eityreia Organization sneered mockingly.</p><p>Mose gave Cuthbert a knowing look from the stands.</p><p>Cuthbert smiled faintly and nodded.</p><p>He stared coldly at Emma, grinning. &quot;You want to challenge me? I have to admit, your family&#x27;s strength is lacking, but you&#x27;ve certainly got guts!</p><p>&quot;Since you&#x27;re so brave, to show my respect, I&#x27;ll give you my full effort. If I accidentally injure you, though, don&#x27;t let your family cry about it afterward.&quot;</p><p>With that, he grinned, a cold glint of murderous intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Emma&#x27;s face darkened. &quot;Do you think you can?</p><p>&quot;Death Realm!&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
