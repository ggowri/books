  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shadows of countless figures poured out from the Campbell headquarters, their faces pale and stricken with fear as they gazed upon the devastated area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena gasped, her eyes widening in disbelief as she spotted the imposing figure hovering in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled slightly, a telltale sign of the fear gripping her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, she had been so close to the chaos unleashed by Gerardo's attack. With his power, the Spatial Collapse he had unleashed would have left no chance for her or any of her fellow Class AAA members to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that single strike, over a hundred members of the Draco Armed Services Branch had lost their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? That's Gerardo, the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice was laced with shock as he stared at the masked giant above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Gerardo let out a chilling laugh. "That's right, it's me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he descended slowly, his presence seemingly devoid of any power </span><span>fluctuations, appearing like an ordinary old man. Yet, Osborne, Serena, and the others remained tense, their muscles coiled like springs, ready to unleash their power in self-defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo smiled, "No need to be so wound up. I was just stopping by to say hello. If I wanted to kill you, your anxiety wouldn't make a difference."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Just to say hello?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single attack that has wiped out over a hundred Draco Armed Services Branch members is merely a hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists, but the instinct to act was stifled by a chilling realization&mdash;Gerardo had locked onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any sudden movement would likely provoke an immediate and devastating response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of fear washed over Osborne, his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Gerardo, after all! He ranked sixtieth on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings; there was no way Osborne could stand against him with his current strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he had the Blood Demon members at his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the presence of over five thousand Blood Demon members standing resolutely behind him, all focused on Gerardo, Osborne let out a small sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "No matter how powerful Gerardo is, he won't stand a chance against a coordinated assault from so many Blood Demon members. He'll be lucky to walk away in one piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo, what brings you here in the dead of night? You've already killed so many of us; I suggest you don't bother returning home&mdash;leave your life here instead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo paused, taken aback for a moment, then chuckled, his gaze fixed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you're Osborne, huh? I've heard quite a bit about you. You've thwarted my plans more than once. If I didn't have more pressing matters, I would've come to kill you myself a long time ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me? You think you can?" Osborne retorted, meeting Gerardo's gaze without flinching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo studied him, searching for any hint of fear in Osborne's eyes, hoping to expose the bravado as a facade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he was met with resolve, and his expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! You're even more arrogant than Sebastian was decades ago! No wonder he saw you as a successor&mdash;you've got the chops!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad for you, though. Even Sebastian was left severely wounded by me. What makes you think you can take my life? They?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured dismissively at the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened, but he remained defiant. "That's right, just with them! Want to test that theory? Sure, you're a top-tier Class S Supreme Overlord, but at the end of the day, you're still human, not a god! I don't believe you can't be defeated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, all five thousand plus Blood Demon members erupted with power, each one channeling their strength to its maximum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weakest among them was already at Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the number of Class AAA members had surpassed five hundred. Most importantly, these fighters had trained together for years, their synergy unmatched. Now, their collective power surged toward Gerardo, creating an overwhelming pressure that bore down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members roared with bloodlust; their battle cries shaking the very heavens. In the face of such terrifying momentum, everyone around them felt minuscule, their hearts filling with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Gerardo's expression darkened at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at the over five thousand Blood Demon members, his face contorting in displeasure as he snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, well! I didn't expect Sebastian to have such a powerful backup!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Head-on? Not a chance! But you think that just because they're with you, you can take me down? Do you really think they'll protect you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here for one thing tonight: to capture you alive and draw Sebastian out! No one can stand in my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved a hand, and an intense wave of spatial energy engulfed Osborne. Before Osborne could even react, the two of them vanished into thin air.</span></p><div class="pagination">
