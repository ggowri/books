  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne neared the Paltrow family's port, he became exceptionally cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were four Class A- metahumans hiding within the port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Kendra could sense their energy fluctuations, she couldn't determine their exact abilities, so Osborne dared not take them lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't afraid of facing four Class A- metahumans, but he knew that defeating them wouldn't be easy. Thus, he planned to launch a surprise attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the ambush succeeded, he could incapacitate at least one, possibly even two, of them right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would make the ensuing battle much more manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, stealthily, Class A- experts were incredibly challenging. He needed to be extremely careful, making no sound and not betraying even the slightest hint of killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep within the port, in an old warehouse, an ancient wooden ship lay quietly docked in a corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four figures were huddled together, seemingly plotting something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though no one was around, they were still dressed in loose black robes, with hoods that obscured their faces, leaving only their eyes visible. It seemed they were deliberately hiding their identities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Webster, what do you make of this?" One of them asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kyle and the others went to attack the Augustine family's cruise ship. By all accounts, it should have been foolproof. Our intelligence indicated that there were only two Class A- elders on board, Jacob and Layla.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There were also some young people on the ship, including the Augustine family's heir, Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their raid should have been a breeze, delivering a heavy blow to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But they failed, which is quite strange."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speaker was a woman with an odd voice, seemingly disguising her tone to make it difficult to discern her age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze turned to the leader of the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had striking purple eyes, though it was unclear if they were naturally that color or a deliberate disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Webster Paltrow, the current leader of the Ghost Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Webster said, "Something is definitely unusual about this. I suspect that Kyle and the others' deaths might not have been at the hands of the Augustine family. Unfortunately, our informants didn't provide more information."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Webster, are you suggesting there might have been a third party involved?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a theory," Webster replied coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over the years, we've done a lot under the name of the Ghost Ship and made a lot of enemies. They've always wanted to eliminate us but couldn't find our hideout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, they might have learned of our plan to attack the Augustine family's cruise and set a trap, waiting for us to take the bait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Alisa Ship cruise might just be a trap."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words caused a visible shift in the others' expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could they find our stronghold?" One man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Webster shook his head. "Unlikely. Our modified Skeleton Ship is incredibly fast, and they wouldn't be able to track us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they could, we'd have been exposed long ago."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the other three breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ghost Ship organization must remain hidden. If discovered, they would either eliminate their enemies or take their own lives. They could not allow themselves to be captured alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what do we do now? We've suffered significant losses and need time to recover. I suggest we temporarily disband, lay low for a while, and regroup later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone proposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Webster shook his head. "No, we can't disband. The Augustine family is on the brink of collapse. We just need to push a little further, and they'll crumble, exiting the ranks of Dampston's ancient families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then their cruise business will be ours. Are you really willing to give up halfway?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think carefully about our next move. I have only one requirement. The heir of the Augustine family, Osborne, is a variable for us, and he must die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked at each other, and one of them spoke calmly, "I felt your desire to kill Osborne isn't because he's a variable, but because he might pose a threat to Alexander, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Webster sneered, "What a joke. Osborne may be talented, but how could he compare to Mr. Paltrow? He could never threaten Mr. Paltrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Paltrow could crush him with one hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Then why are you so eager to eliminate Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough. Stop bickering. Osborne does need to be eliminated, but this time, we must be more cautious. We can't afford any mistakes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four stopped arguing and began seriously discussing their next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them noticed that Osborne had already lurked nearby. Osborne had suppressed all his power, activating only his Satan's Eye, observing their every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was just over 300 feet away, Osborne knew the time had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked onto the figure closest to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sprang from the shadows. While still in mid-air, he swiftly transformed into a Vampire. His blood-red hair grew wildly, instantly stretching over 300 feet and piercing into the man's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Osborne darted forward, delivering a crushing blow to the man's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unprepared, the man was sent flying by Osborne with a loud bang, and blood splashed everywhere.</span></p><div class="pagination">
