  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's anxious voice echoed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad! The Eighth World Tree offshoot has fully absorbed the Bloodstrike Orb's Crimson Energy, and it's recovering rapidly! Osborne, you need to take it down. Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he sensed the Eighth World Tree offshoot regaining strength, he lifted the Bloodwrought Bow once more. The three powerful Divine Marks etched into the bow, crafted by the Creation Herald himself and being a Divine Ascendance Technique, surged to life. He aimed at the trunk of the Eighth World Tree offshoot and released three terrifying arrows in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Divine Marks represented the Creation Herald's might, delivering an attack that packed about eighty percent of his full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Eighth World Tree offshoot had been at its peak, such an assault wouldn't have stood a chance of defeating it, let alone inflicting any real damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, the Creation Herald wouldn't have been entangled with the Eighth World Tree offshoot for centuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the situation had changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eighth World Tree offshoot had been severely weakened by the Bloodstrike Orb's devastating Crimson Energy, its power reduced to an unprecedented low. Its primary weapon, the roots, had been completely obliterated, and its trunk was now less than one percent of its original strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this weakened state, the three arrows infused with the Divine Ascendance Technique, propelled by the Bloodwrought Bow, posed a lethal threat to the Eighth World Tree offshoot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The offshoot finally sensed the presence of an "ant" lurking in its own territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it felt the immense power of the arrows, its trunk twisted wildly in a desperate attempt to evade the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a furious roar erupted in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You damned ant! How dare you strike at the greatness that is me! You will pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of dizziness wash over him as a massive surge of mental strength crashed into his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soul attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eighth World Tree offshoot, lacking its roots, could still launch a soul assault, and its soul power was staggering, leaving Osborne astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was far from ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a snort, he shouted, "Soul Barrier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Soul Barrier that Isa had taught him activated once again, absorbing most of the Eighth World Tree offshoot's soul attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The residual soul power that penetrated his Soul Current Ocean couldn't affect its golden depths, especially with Primordial's protection shielding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, the Eighth World Tree offshoot's soul attack faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne heard its enraged roar once more. "Damn it! You have the Ninth World Tree offshoot hidden in your Soul Current Ocean! You're coming for me! You're coming for me! No! I won't accept this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That weakling has no right to devour me! Why should it absorb me? I won't stand for it! I should be the one to consume it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eighth World Tree offshoot's despair was palpable in its furious cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, after its soul attack failed, it had run out of options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the three arrows struck its trunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three arrows, each embodying a different Divine Ascendance Technique infused with the powers of fire, metal, and wind elemental, erupted from the Creation Herald's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they struck the Eighth World Tree offshoot, the results were nothing short of catastrophic. The already weakened trunk ignited in flames and began to crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fragments of bark exploded in every direction as the Eighth World Tree offshoot caught fire, its cries of agony turning even more pitiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faint glimmer of recovery it had just begun to experience plummeted once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice surged into Osborne's mind, brimming with excitement and urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's finished! Osborne, quickly absorb the Crimson Energy from my roots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our best chance. While it's still weak and not dead, I can merge with it and take all its power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we wait until it dies, we'll only get a fraction of what it has!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial sounded increasingly anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "You're aware that your roots are packed with Crimson Energy? What if we end up getting wiped out by it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his reservations, Osborne decided to give it a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eighth World Tree offshoot had absorbed Crimson Energy without apparent side effects, so surely his Infinite Devouring Eyes could do the same!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of how Primordial would absorb and assimilate the Eighth World Tree offshoot, gaining all of its immense energy, filled Osborne with a thrilling sense of anticipation and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Eighth World Tree offshoot was comparable to that of an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Infinite Devouring Eyes!" he murmured, and the eyes, which had been in the Hope Haven, manifested before him, shimmering with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absorb!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his thoughts, the massive Infinite Devouring Eyes enveloped Primordial's roots, ravenously consuming the Crimson Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Crimson Energy from Primordial's roots vanished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did it!" Primordial exclaimed, his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the Infinite Devouring Eyes still wrapped around his roots, he surged forth from Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, racing toward the Eighth World Tree offshoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eighth! You've lost! Now give me all your power! I will carry your will and merge with the other seven World Tree offshoots, bringing the true World Tree back into this world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Primordial finished speaking, the Eighth World Tree offshoot suddenly froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, it responded, "You've won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why must it be you? If it weren't for my long struggle with the Creation Herald, you would never have had the chance to be born! What a pity...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll never have the chance to restore the World Tree yourself. The other seven offshoots have grown far too powerful. You'll never catch up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied earnestly, "That's my concern! Now, surrender your power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eighth World Tree offshoot resigned itself. "Fine! I hope you truly succeed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, its trunk shattered completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive emerald-green orb, radiating a faint crimson hue, appeared in the air, exuding an incredibly pure and terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's heart raced at the sight of the orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One of the nine Tree Hearts of the World Tree! I finally have you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Primordial's roots plunged into the massive emerald-green orb, unaware that Osborne's Infinite Devouring Eyes followed suit, merging into the heart of the World Tree.</span></p><div class="pagination">
