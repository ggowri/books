  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Radcliffe Estate stood solemn. After more than half a month of relentless effort, Clarissa had finally settled the funerary arrangements for the fallen members of her family. All their properties in Skyefall had been sold save for this old house.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa wandered through the Radcliffe Estate. Her eyes reflected a deep reluctance to leave.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Radcliffe family, having endured for centuries, had grown from an inconsequential small family to one of the seven ancient families of Skyefall. Yet, now, Clarissa had made the decision to relinquish their roots in Skyefall and seek new horizons in Newport City.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before departing, Clarissa harbored a sense of hesitation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa, are we truly going to Newport City?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've lived in Skyefall all my life. The thought of moving elsewhere feels unsettling."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Donna's sudden question broke the silence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dylan and Eugen let out deep sighs. The weight of years hung heavily upon them as they steeped in the love for the Radcliffe Estate. Yet, the mantle of leadership had passed to Clarissa, whose eyes now sparkled with visions of Newport City. Despite their reluctance, they knew they must yield to her will.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, the Radcliffe family had been brought to the brink of extinction by the Aberrants. Staying in Skyefall offered no guarantees against further attacks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thus, the move to Newport City was not just desired but necessary.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aunt Donna, Newport City is grander and more prosperous than Skyefall. Our Radcliffe family will flourish there. And Osborne is in Newport City; I cannot bear to be apart from him. We must go to Newport City!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a voice both clear and resolute, Clarissa declared, "Let's go! Once we've carved out our place in Newport City, we'll be free to return whenever we wish."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Clarissa led everyone out of the Radcliffe Estate.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Alongside them stood the remnants of the Radcliffe family, a resilient group of over a dozen who had, by fate or fortune, been spared the calamity when the Aberrants attacked the Radcliffe family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this pivotal moment, the group, nearing twenty in number, represented the entirety of the Radcliffe family's surviving lineage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They closed the gates of the Radcliffe Estate, ready to drive toward Newport City.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, just as they were about to leave, a luxurious convoy approached.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The abrupt screech of brakes sliced through the air as the opulent convoy came to a halt before the Radcliffe Estate. Doors swung open, and a cadre of men in sleek black suits emerged with haste. Each face wore an expression of haughty confidence. They exuded an aura of formidable power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear they were not natives of Rosmandi.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa frowned, and the members of the Radcliffe family grew nervous.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A woman in her thirties stepped out of the luxury car, flanked by the men in black. She approached Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes lit up at the sight of Clarissa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must be Clarissa, the Fatebearer. Rumors speak of your beauty, likening you to a flawless iceberg. I doubted, but now I see the truth in those words. You outshine even the princess of Marcelin."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman fixed her gaze intently on Clarissa as her lips curved into a smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's frown deepened. "Are you from Marcelin? Do you have business with me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman's smile remained. "Let me introduce myself. I am Ebony Thornberry, from the Thornberry family, the most powerful divine family in Marcelin. Indeed, my family is the most powerful divine family in the world.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've come to see you for a reason, a very good reason. You may have heard of my brother, Marlon Thornberry."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's pride was evident as she spoke.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa frowned and coldly replied, "I'm sorry, but I've never heard of the Thornberry family, you, or your brother.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just tell me what you want. I'm in a hurry!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony was taken aback, and then her eyes flashed with contempt. "You've never heard of us? You truly are from a small place. No matter. All you need to know is that the Thornberry family is the most powerful divine family in the world. My brother, Marlon, is unparalleled among the younger generation, not just in Marcelin but across the globe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He ranks 40th on the Godson Rankings! This is because he has been striving for reaching Class S recently instead of improving his ranking. Otherwise, my brother would certainly have a chance to enter the top 20, or even the top 10 of the Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony remained proud.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa was shocked. Despite her unfamiliarity with the Thornberry family and the Godson Rankings, she understood the weight of aiming to reach Class S at such a young age.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, what is it you want to say? Why have you come to see me?" Clarissa asked with a sense of foreboding growing within her. She looked serious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't believe I have any connection to your family."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony smiled faintly. "In the past, you indeed had no right to any association with our Thornberry family, but now, things have changed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because my brother has a crush on you!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Prepare yourself and come back to Marcelin with me. My brother will arrange a grand wedding for you as soon as possible. It is your honor to marry my brother."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Ebony finished speaking, a mix of shock and disbelief gnawed Clarissa.</p><div class="pagination">
