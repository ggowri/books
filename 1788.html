  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Ambrose's team crumbled, the spectators from various races stood frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They simply couldn't wrap their heads around what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the tournament began, they had confidently predicted that Ambrose and the other young talents would sweep the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings aside without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, here they were, three matches in, feeling utterly humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the first match, Vivienne from the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings had dispatched eight of their brightest with a single move, leaving no room for retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second match saw Bryce and Kendra similarly crush their opponents with startling ease, highlighting the vast gap in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then came the third match, where Ambrose, a mid-stage Deity King, stepped in, and everyone believed he would restore their honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, he faced an even more humiliating defeat&mdash;first being overwhelmed by the lower-ranked Hannah and then falling to Zoe, who was also beneath him in rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The disparity was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the faces of the onlookers turned grim, their spirits sinking into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose, once hailed as the top talent of the Thunderstorm Drake Clan, had fallen. If even he couldn't stand up against the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, who could possibly bear the burden of their collective pride?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And where was "Theodore", the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings? He hadn't even stepped into the fray yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the thought of the Paramount Supreme Clan crossed everyone's mind as they glanced at the imposing Supreme Malevolence Airships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all knew that with Ambrose's defeat, the only hope for reclaiming their honor lay in the hands of the Paramount Supreme Clan's elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What started as a whisper quickly grew into a thunderous roar as more and more voices joined in, calling out for the Paramount Supreme Clan to send forth their young talents to teach the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings a lesson they wouldn't soon forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, millions of voices surged together, echoing like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, a cold, commanding voice broke through the clamor from one of the Supreme Malevolence Airships. "Hmph! A bunch of useless fools! The glory of our races will ultimately be defended by us, the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tristram, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings have killed your cousin Alfred and taken down many of your Bowman family's strong warriors. Now, you're to lead the charge and bring them down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bring back their heads!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the voice faded, eight young figures soared into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the forefront was Tristram, the first heir of the Bowman family, his gaze locked onto Osborne with a chilling intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He landed on the arena, followed closely by seven masked companions, their faces hidden from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, their powerful auras were unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each one was a peak early Deity King, and astonishingly, they all wielded Supreme Malevolence Swords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All eight of them were equipped with both the Supreme Malevolence Sword and the Supreme Malevolence Shield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight of them sent waves of excitement through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan is finally stepping in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tristram is a mid-stage Deity King and the first heir of the Bowman family! He's definitely stronger than Ambrose! And his seven allies, though only early Deity Kings, are armed with Supreme Malevolence Swords and Shields! Their strength is on a whole different level compared to Ambrose's support!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are in real trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're bound to win this battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings better take this seriously. They'll have to fight together just to stand a chance against Tristram's team! Even then, they might still be defeated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The various races regained their confidence, buoyed by the prospect of Tristram's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Tristram himself shared this sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He raised his Supreme Malevolence Sword, pointing it menacingly at Osborne. "Theodore, step forward and face me! Back then, you hid in the shadows and used divine power to project yourself for a fight, giving you the upper hand. But today, we'll battle face-to-face in this arena, and I'll show you just how I'll defeat you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Tristram wore a proud expression, his eyes blazing with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You killed my cousin Alfred, and today I will avenge him! I'll take down you and the entire Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, along with that Hannah from the Mystic Feather Clan&mdash;none of you will be spared!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let everyone see the consequences of crossing the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Tristram finished his declaration, the crowd erupted into cheers, electrified by his fierce resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to avenge Alfred? You think you can take me on in a fair fight? Unfortunately, I don't think you're worthy of that challenge yet. You won't even need me to step in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a glance at Mila and Diana, he continued, "Mila, Diana, you two haven't had your turn yet, have you? How about you take this one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mila and Diana exchanged serious looks but nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sounds good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, they stepped forward, Supreme Malevolence Swords drawn, their expressions icy and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
