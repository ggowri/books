  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression became extremely serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Are the Beast Soul Flowers here really planted by some powerful creature? Is the entire volcanic area that creature's herb field?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Am I stealing Beast Soul Flowers from someone else's herb field? If this is true, once that creature discovers what I've done, it will definitely stop at nothing to kill me. So, should I leave here immediately?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very unwilling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A single Beast Soul Flower can be exchanged for one million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>, equivalent to the value of a regular low-grade Sacred Artifact. In just half a day here, he had already found sixty-five Beast Soul Flowers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This wasn't much because he hadn't discovered the planting pattern of the Beast Soul Flowers before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he had discovered the pattern and could easily find Beast Soul Flowers. At the center of the volcanic area, there was one Beast Soul Flower for every hundred volcanoes. Next, he could directly follow the pattern to search. This way, his efficiency could increase by dozens of times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, Osborne didn't want to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said seriously, "I can't leave now. We've been searching here for half a day, and no creatures have appeared to stop me. So, even if these Beast Soul Flowers were planted by some powerful being, it must either not be here for now or be in a deep sleep."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've already picked sixty-five Beast Soul Flowers. Even if I leave now, that powerful being won't let me go. After all, I can't replant </span><span>them</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the Beast Soul Flower is picked, it loses its vitality.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued, "So leaving is the worst choice. I should pick as many </span><span>Beast</span><span> Soul Flowers as possible before being discovered. After all, the Beast Soul Flowers here follow a pattern, and I can harvest them very quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the pattern we discovered is correct, I can pick at least a few hundred Beast Soul Flowers in the central area within a day. I can leave then."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Most importantly, since we can discover the pattern of the Beast Soul Flowers, others will too. Valentino, Brenda, Dustin, and the others must have already arrived in the volcanic area and are searching for Beast Soul Flowers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If they discover the pattern of the Beast Soul Flowers, they'll be able to find a large number of them in a short time. If I leave now, it would be like handing these Beast Soul Flowers over to them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After the zone duel ends, the resources and treasures I find will definitely not compare to theirs. By then, I won't stand a chance of winning the championship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with determination. He continued, "So, I must pick all the Beast Soul Flowers in the volcanic center area before leaving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial frowned tightly and said, "You're really not afraid of death. Let me be honest with you, the powerful creature that planted these Beast Soul Flowers is absolutely not something you can defeat right now. If you're discovered, I'm afraid you won't even be able to escape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "I know, so I'll be careful. Next, I'll pick all the Beast Soul Flowers in the center area as quickly as possible and leave immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, I have spatial power and numerous methods. Even if that powerful creature is at mid Empyrean Sacredness or even advanced Empyrean Sacredness, it can't kill me in a short time. Besides, on Abyssal Planet, apart from Gerald, the chief judge, there are at least a hundred other judges."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as I can buy some time, the judges will definitely come and slay that powerful creature."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said helplessly, "Alright. Since you've already decided, nothing I say will change your mind. Just be careful. I have a feeling something's not right."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't waste any more time. Since he didn't know when that powerful creature would return or wake up, he needed to gather as many </span><span>Beast</span><span> Soul Flowers as possible, as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took action immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the pattern, at the center of the volcanic area, there would be one Beast Soul Flower for every hundred volcanoes. Osborne had been searching one volcano at a time before, afraid of missing any.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he headed straight to a distant volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly arrived and scanned the entire volcano with Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll soon know if the pattern we discovered is correct," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he truly saw a Beast Soul Flower floating in the magma pool deep within this volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "There really is a Beast Soul Flower here. </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> guess is likely true. I can't waste time; I need to pick it quickly and leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly picked the Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, after skipping a hundred volcanoes, Osborne quickly appeared above the next target volcano. He swiftly scanned the volcano with Satan's Eye and once again discovered a Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pushed his speed to the limit, continuously discovering Beast Soul Flowers, picking them, and heading to the next target volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even started using interdimensional travel just to make himself faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, his speed of picking Beast Soul Flowers increased dozens of times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, it took him half a day to find sixty-five Beast Soul Flowers. But now, he found three hundred in just one hour.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three hundred Beast Soul Flowers can be exchanged for three billion Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne had no time to be happy, as the regular appearance of Beast Soul Flowers further confirmed </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> suspicion&mdash;that these Beast Soul Flowers were indeed planted by some powerful creature.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Where is this powerful creature now? When will it appear?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t know, so he could only be more careful and cautious, frantically picking Beast Soul Flowers as fast as possible without making too much noise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've already picked about one-tenth of the entire volcanic core area. In just a dozen more hours at most, I can harvest all the Beast Soul Flowers in the core area. There are at least three thousand Beast Soul Flowers here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The density of Beast Soul Flowers in the outer volcanic area isn't as high as in the core area. There should be no more than a thousand Beast Soul Flowers there. So, I won't waste time there," Osborne thought while moving quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, eight hours had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gradually relaxed. By now, he had harvested 80% of the volcanic core area, </span><span>with</span><span> </span><span>three thousand Beast Soul Flowers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In at most two more hours, he could finish harvesting all the Beast Soul Flowers in the core area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, a furious roar suddenly echoed from afar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no idea what creature made this roar. But it was incredibly piercing and sharp, instantly causing his eardrums to bleed. He felt a wave of dizziness, stumbled, and almost fell from mid-air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, his Sacred Power reacted automatically, quickly shielding him securely, making him feel less uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his expression turned extremely serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked toward the east. That beastly roar came from the east.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "</span><span>Primordial's</span><span> guess must have come true. The powerful creature that planted the Beast Soul Flower has appeared. Clearly, it has discovered its Beast Soul Flowers were stolen and is roaring furiously."</span></p><div class="pagination">
