  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you've been exposed, just fight!" Osborne was calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the straight passage, there was not even any cover for him to avoid the countless bullets that were shooting toward him. If it were anyone else, they would probably have despaired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne remained composed and snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, ocular energy burst out, covering the passage in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the bullets shooting toward Osborne suddenly stopped in mid-air and then shot back in the direction they came from at an even faster speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, more than a dozen gunmen were shot before they could react. They screamed and fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These werewolves behind the gunmen were also shot by bullets, but their skin was thick, and the bullets that were bounced&nbsp;back by Osborne's ocular energy were not enough to penetrate their bodies were all stuck in the flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They roared in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, they got on all fours and crept toward Osborne at a terrifying speed. When they were a few yards away from Osborne, they jumped high, showed their sharp claws, and pounced on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!" Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, he saw the werewolf for the first time in the Radcliffe Manor. At that time, he was besieged by ten werewolves, and it was a tough fight. He could only inflict heavy damage on these werewolves by enduring their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Clarissa hadn't been using the Holy Light Healing to heal his injuries, Osborne would have been no match for these werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, facing a dozen of werewolves, Osborne was very confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The invisible ocular energy turned into a terrifying fist and punched the werewolf in front. The ocular energy's power reached its limit of ten thousand pounds, breaking the werewolf's waist. It fell to the ground with a bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The werewolf died!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne started another round of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These werewolves died one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was&nbsp;still&nbsp;standing&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;same spot.&nbsp;He controlled the ocular energy and killed these ferocious werewolves in mid-air. No werewolf could get within five yards of him or survive under the attack of his ocular energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After transforming, these werewolves became beasts who could not feel pain or fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They only knew to rush forward to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like moths to a flame, they constantly rushed towards Osborne. The ocular energy broke their bones, and some werewolves' heads were even blown off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, more than a dozen werewolves were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The passage returned to silence, leaving only Osborne, who was still standing there, safe and sound, and the werewolves' corpses on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "No wonder Barlyn said my power belongs to the mind control category. This kind of attack is indeed the method used by mind control metahumen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level one Satan's Eye could only enhance Osborne's eyesight. It could be considered an amplification power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level two Satan's Eye could let Osborne see through everything. It could be considered an auxiliary power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level three Satan's Eye could be used to control objects. It was a mind control power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The level four Satan's Eye could emit the Devil's Light. It belonged to the elemental category.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Every time my Satan's Eye is upgraded, it can activate a new power, and it is a power of a different category. When I upgrade the Satan's Eye to level ten, will I have ten different powers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne felt that Satan's Eye was too powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other people's power often only had one ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, Donna had earth elemental power, and she could only control the earth elemental. She didn't have the power of mind control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What new power can I have when I upgrade Satan's Eye to level five? I remember it was projecting illusions. That should be a psychic power, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Psychic power had always been the most bizarre. Osborne only knew that Milo had psychic power. Thinking of Milo's strange eyes, Osborne was still&nbsp;a&nbsp;little shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't had Satan's Eye, which could restrain Milo's mind control, he would&nbsp;have been&nbsp;controlled by Milo and&nbsp;died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, "Forget it. It's the power of level five Satan's Eye. I haven't even activated the new power of level four Satan's Eye yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must catch Raymond as soon as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I catch him, the new ability of level four Satan's Eye can be activated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne walked towards the inner place of the passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, outside the slums in the south of the city, Barlyn, Clarissa, Donna, and others had already gathered together, nervously waiting for Osborne's orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The&nbsp;sound&nbsp;of&nbsp;gunfire came from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was shooting the gang members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gunshots? Did you hear any gunshots?" Barlyn asked with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that the attack has already started? No, I have to take the assault team to support Osborne!" Clarissa was worried and looked at Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shook her head. "Calm down. This is the gunshot of a very ancient pistol. Only low-level gang members use it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Osborne couldn't even deal with them, how could he defeat Raymond?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since he told you to wait for his orders, just wait. Don't be so nervous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Donna finished speaking, Barlyn looked embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, there's a problem with the second Bodyguard Unit!" Suddenly, Harris' anxious voice sounded on Donna's intercom.</span></p><div class="pagination">
