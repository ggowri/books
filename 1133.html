  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "A Beast Tide? Just a Beast Tide, and it's causing you all this trouble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, that can't be right! In this modern age, there aren't that many truly Ferocious Beasts left in the wild. Even if they have evolved, it's only been three months!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In just three months, even the fastest evolving beasts would only reach Class C or maybe Class B at best. If they were to push it, they might scrape by at Class A, but that's hardly enough to give the Augustine family a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We could send a few experts out there, and they'd wipe the Beast Tide clean off the map!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Sebastian shook his head vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matthew, why don't you take it from here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew nodded, stepping forward to clarify. "Godfather, it's not as simple as you think! The Beast Tide is mostly made up of Class C and Class B beasts. Sure, even with their numbers, the various Ancient Families and superpowers should be able to </span><span>handle them. After all, in the last three months, their strengths have surged dramatically, and many have even broken through to new levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ancient Families and superpowers have their interests in the cities, so they won't let the Beast Tide threaten urban safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If cities fall into chaos or, worse, get destroyed, it's the ordinary people who suffer the most, but the Ancient Families and superpowers would take a massive hit too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why they've been rallying to protect the cities from the Beast Tide! Ordinary folks who've gained some powers are joining in too, banding together to defend their homes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a breath, then continued, "But things have taken a turn for the worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Among the Beast Tide, there are a lot of what you'd call Ferocious Beasts! These creatures look bizarre and are incredibly powerful, with many reaching Class A or even Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their destructive capabilities are staggering. They seem to </span><span>possess a high level of intelligence, coordinating their attacks like a well-trained army, launching assaults on cities and causing massive devastation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some cities have already fallen to the Beast Tide, and countless innocent lives have been lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In rural areas, the situation is even worse! Over the past couple of weeks, many cities have been under siege, and holding the line is becoming increasingly difficult. The Ancient Families and superpowers are nearing their breaking point, and they've all been reaching out to us for help...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If these cities fall to the Beast Tide, it'll deal a huge blow to the interests of our Draco Group! Not to mention, many of these Ancient Families are on good terms with us. We can't just stand by and watch as the Beast Tide wreaks havoc and slaughters the innocent. That's why we've been sending aid...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the reports we've been getting back are nothing short of horrifying..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he pulled up some videos on a screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The footage, captured by drones, showcased the chaos wrought by the Beast Tide&mdash;thousands of beasts rampaging through cities, destroying everything in their path. The air was filled with the screams of terrified civilians, and the ground was littered with shattered bodies and collapsed buildings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a scene straight out of a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the chaos, Osborne spotted several strange Ferocious Beasts, their appearances grotesque. Some were armored with thick shells, while others had razor-sharp jaws or hands adorned with dozens of deadly claws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were no ordinary Ferocious Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Exotic Beasts that had never been seen on the Blue Planet before. Their power was formidable, with many at least Class A and a significant number reaching Class AA, Class AAA, or even Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clicked through several videos, and as the horrifying scenes unfolded before him, he couldn't help but gasp in shock. His expression grew genuinely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are these Beast Tide attacks only happening in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>?" Osborne asked gravely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew shook his head. "No! They're breaking out all over the world! And they're </span><span>getting worse by the day! </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> is comparatively better off. The Ancient Families and superpowers in various regions are shouldering the responsibility of protecting cities and putting in the effort to fend off the Beast Tides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In many countries, the superpowers couldn't care less about the common folk, just fortifying their own bases! Numerous cities have already fallen to the Beast Tides. The civilians either flee to other cities or get eaten by the beasts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bottom line, the whole world is in chaos right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some are even saying... the apocalypse is upon us! The era of human rule on the Blue Planet is coming to an end! These newly emerged Exotic Beasts will take over, ruling Blue Planet in our stead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And just a day ago, our drones spotted a massive gathering of beasts in the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains. They numbered at least 200 thousand, reaching the scale of a mid-sized Beast Tide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Among them, the peculiar Ferocious Beasts amount to over 10 thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If nothing unexpected happens, they'll launch a Beast Tide attack on Newport City soon! Before you awoke, we were discussing how to withstand this Beast Tide..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Matthew's explanation, Osborne finally grasped the dire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Beast Tide? Exotic Beasts?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
