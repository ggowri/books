  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to keep me here? In your dreams!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot forward without a moment's hesitation, channeling the full force of the Divine Bone in his right leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't activate the Light Realm; he'd already learned the hard way that even at Level Four, it would shatter like glass before Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Light Realm posed no threat to Gerardo whatsoever, and its collapse would only backfire on Osborne, leaving his mental strength in tatters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only one option left: the might of his right leg's Divine Bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination, he swung his leg at Gerardo's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo looked startled for a split second, clearly not expecting Osborne to initiate the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smirk spread across his face. "Looks like you've forgotten your last lesson! You think that without the God Binding Rope, I can't handle you? It would be a cakewalk to take you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he unleashed a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their collision was explosive&mdash;a thunderous impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grunted as a wave of might slammed into him, sending him flying while blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Gerardo felt the shock of the kick, too. His face paled slightly as he </span><span>staggered back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, Osborne channeled his Explosive Force, driving the power of his right leg's Divine Bone deep into Gerardo's body. Even though Gerardo was a top-tier Class S, he still felt the sting of injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo thought, incredulous, "Did Osborne just push me back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I even took a bit of damage?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've always considered him beneath me, yet here I am, reeling from a Class AAA fighter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright! No wonder Sebastian chose you as his successor; no wonder you're the top contender on the Godson Rankings. You certainly have some impressive skills! Seems I underestimated you before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't think for a second that this gives you a chance to escape!" Gerardo declared, extending his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Prison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the air around Osborne shifted, the very fabric of space closing in around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was trapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was all too familiar with Spatial Prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face tightened in alarm, and without thinking, he unleashed a massive kick against the barrier surrounding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spatial Prison erupted, crumbling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he thought he had broken free, the follow-up attack hit him like a freight train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The devastating force of the Spatial Collapse made Osborne's Satan's Eye pulse rapidly. Luckily, he had managed to evade the core of the collapse, but the escape came at a price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed up blood from the sheer force, the pain gnawing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Gerardo snorted, fury rising within him at being unable to finish off Osborne after such a strong series of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His energy spiked in intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he was at Osborne's back. "Get down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's hand crashed onto Osborne's shoulder, pinning him in place. It felt like ten mountains had landed on his back, and his knees buckled, almost giving way beneath the weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veins bulged in his forehead as Osborne struggled to gather every ounce of strength just to withstand the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get off me!" Osborne growled, summoning the energy of his Divine Bone once more and pivoting sharply, kicking at Gerardo with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gerardo anticipated this move. With a smirk, he vanished from sight, reappearing hundreds of yards away, hovering above the ground, watching Osborne closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's foot met nothing but air. He shifted into a defensive stance, keeping a wary eye on his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo stared in utter astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "With my strength, how can a Class AAA opponent shrug off my attacks like this? It's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The frustration bubbled within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brat, I initially just wanted to control you, but since you're putting up such a fight, I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined look, Gerardo raised his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Domain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful force surged forth, and Osborne felt as if he had plunged into a swamp, the very fabric of space squeezing him, making each breath a struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense that Gerardo's Spatial Domain was at its Level Three peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, wielded by Gerardo, it felt magnitudes stronger than his own Level Four Light Realm, radiating an aura of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To push me to this point with your pathetic efforts? You should be proud! But don't kid yourself; you've reached your limit. It's time to accept your fate as my captive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Gerardo vanished from sight, reappearing suddenly behind Osborne, his hand gripping Osborne's shoulder tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself completely immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Gerardo's Spatial Domain shook violently, and in a split second, it shattered before Osborne's stunned eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, he caught a glimpse of a familiar figure&mdash;an aged silhouette emerging from the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Sebastian!</span></p><div class="pagination">
