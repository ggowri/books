  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was consumed by an intense desire for more Radiant Golden Ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In many ways, the value of this ore surpassed even that of Azure Ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, while Azure Ore enhanced the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow, Radiant Golden Ore strengthened Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow was just an external tool; turning it into a Sacred Artifact would certainly boost Osborne's combat power, but it wasn't essential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether or not the bow became a Sacred Artifact didn't concern him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he was strong enough, there would always be opportunities to acquire other Sacred Artifacts in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Satan's Eye was the foundation of Osborne's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A breakthrough to the Sacredness Level might not yield an immediate increase in his power, but it would give him significant advantages in many areas, allowing him to elevate his strength more quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope my Spatial Clone can find more Mud Golems and snag me some more Radiant Golden Ore!" Osborne thought, relying solely on his Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Corrosive Marsh was vast, and on his own, how many Mud Golems could he </span><span>possibly locate? He could only count on the two hundred or so Spatial Clones he had sent out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly focused on the situation with his Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, disappointment washed over him. Despite being scattered throughout the Corrosive Marsh for some time, none of the two hundred-plus clones had encountered a single Mud Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a single piece of Azure Ore or Radiant Golden Ore had been found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that even in the Corrosive Marsh, the number of Mud Golems is quite limited! They're hiding deep in the swamp, and even with my Satan's Eye upgraded, I can only see sixty-six feet down. Finding a Mud Golem is going to be a challenge!" Osborne frowned, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an idea sparked in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I draw them out? The Mud Golems hide in the depths of the swamp and will attack any intruders. If I create a commotion, I should be able to lure them out!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with only two hundred plus Spatial Clones, that's still not enough for the vastness of the Corrosive Marsh. However, I could summon Dark Undead...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Undead Cataclysm is already at Level Eight, allowing me to summon up to ten million Dark </span><span>Undeads</span><span> at once! That's enough to fill every corner of the Corrosive Marsh! Once they appear, the Mud Golems will surely show themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Dark </span><span>Undeads</span><span> might not be strong enough to take on the Mud Golems, but as long as I can draw them out, my Spatial Clones can swoop in and take them down, snagging both Azure Ore and Radiant Golden Ore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this plan, I might just clear out all the Mud Golems in the entire Corrosive Marsh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement lit up Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearing out every Mud Golem in the Corrosive Marsh was a bold idea, but he was confident that he could pull it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting any time, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Alfreda was deep in meditation with her Element Gold Crystal, so Osborne didn't disturb her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he unleashed his Undead Cataclysm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An endless wave of Dark Undead responded to his call, materializing before him&mdash;ten million strong, stretching as far as the eye could see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go! Draw out every Mud Golem in this Corrosive Marsh!" Osborne commanded, and the ten million Dark </span><span>Undeads</span><span> surged forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly spread out like a tide of darkness, moving across the marsh under Osborne's control. Instead of being cautious, they made a deliberate ruckus, creating a significant disturbance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's just a waiting game!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Dark Undead fan out, the Mud Golems will sense them and launch an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's when I'll reap the rewards!" Osborne thought, settling in to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have to wait long this time before sensing an attack on a Dark Undead to the east. Through the perspective of the Dark Undead, Osborne quickly grasped the </span><span>situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed a Mud Golem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced with excitement. Although his Dark Undead was swiftly taken down by the Mud Golem, he had pinpointed its location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was time to hunt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He ordered his No. 47 clone to rush over immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time it arrived, however, the Mud Golem had already retreated deeper into the swamp. Even with the enhanced vision of Satan's Eye, Osborne couldn't locate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was certain that a Mud Golem was nearby. He decided not to let the No. 47 clone leave empty-handed. Instead, he commanded it to unleash its power and strike the swamp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook as the No. 47 clone attacked, and soon enough, several Mud Golems emerged from the depths of the marsh, enraged and ready to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twelve Mud Golems!" Osborne exclaimed, his excitement soaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had expected to find only one, but twelve was a delightful surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant twelve pieces of Azure Ore and twenty-four pieces of Radiant Golden Ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, can the No. 47 clone handle twelve Mud Golems on its own?" he wondered, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Corrosive Marsh was vast, and his other clones were too far away to provide immediate backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's give it a shot!" Osborne decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of his Spatial Clones could utilize his spatial power, and in terms of combat strength, each clone had about sixty to seventy percent of his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Mud Golems had formidable defenses, Osborne believed his clone could take them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only real weakness of a Spatial Clone was its lack of defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mud Golems might be strong, yet they were slow. As long as the clone avoided the blue light emitted during the Mud Golem's attacks, it should be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sense of confidence, he declared, "Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 47 clone launched into action, activating a spatial Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;the Spatial Oblivion Slash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, Osborne had two spatial Divine Ascendance Techniques at his disposal&mdash;Spatial Oblivion Slash and Dimensional Maw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clones could only use the Spatial Oblivion Slash because the energy required for the Dimensional Maw was immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne himself could only manage it once before needing to recuperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His clones simply couldn't muster that much energy in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could, Osborne's clones would be even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even the Spatial Oblivion Slash was more than enough to deal with the Mud Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle erupted fiercely as the Dimensional Razor unleashed by the No. 47 clone crashed against the tough bodies of the Mud Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Mud Golem's attacks were deftly dodged by the clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fight was turning out to be easier than Osborne had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a few minutes later, all twelve Mud Golems lay defeated at the hands of the No. 47 clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twelve pieces of Azure Ore and twenty-four pieces of Radiant Golden Ore were stored in the clone's Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne eagerly retrieved them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, another Dark Undead encountered a Mud Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't contain his joy. While he continued to use the Radiant Golden Ore to enhance Satan's Eye, he ordered the nearby Spatial Clones to hurry over and finish off the Mud Golem.</span></p><div class="pagination">
