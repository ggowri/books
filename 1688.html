  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison and Angelo made the same choice&mdash;run!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the forty-odd people, except for the unlucky one Edison had pushed toward Osborne, quickly scattered in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their logic was simple. Osborne was just one man, and he could only chase a few of them. No matter how powerful Osborne was, he couldn't stop them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately, they had underestimated Osborne's capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kicked the unlucky guy away with a cold sneer on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can escape? Eclipse of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An endless darkness instantly enveloped a thirty-mile radius around Osborne. Despite their speed, Edison and the others couldn't escape such a vast area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split second, they found themselves trapped in complete darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't hear, see, or sense anything. Even their sense of direction was lost. Panic set in as they spun wildly in the darkness, terror gripping their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Undead Cataclysm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne summoned Dark Undead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand of them appeared around Edison and the others. Each Dark Undead was equivalent to a mid-stage Deity Overlord, not much weaker than Edison's group but vastly outnumbering them. In the perpetual darkness, these Dark Undeads gained even more power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such conditions, how could Edison and the others stand a chance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shrieks of agony rang out, one after another until they finally ceased. With a wave of his hand, Osborne dispelled the darkness, leaving Edison and the others sprawled on the ground, grievously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Serves you right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cast a contemptuous glance at them, then quickly began the transformation process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being only at the initial stage of Deity Overlord, Osborne's power was sufficient to forcibly transform them without shattering their divine power essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Edison and the others were all transformed into Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison and the others bowed respectfully to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, then turned his attention to the battle with Angelo and the eight clones. The fight was nearly over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo had given it his all, unleashing all his trump cards, even destroying one of Osborne's clones. But he was no match for the remaining seven, who mercilessly held him down, leaving him battered and bruised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vitality was strong, but it couldn't last much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clones unleashed their spatial powers, hammering Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His divine power essence was shattered by Osborne's clones, and his immense divine power dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair etched itself on Angelo's face as he glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why struggle? Sure, you're a Deity King warrior and won't die easily, but getting beaten to a pulp won't be a pleasant experience." Osborne looked down on Angelo with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo shouted angrily, "Osborne, you despicable human! If you have any courage, kill me! Lord Malevolence will avenge me. Your lowly Human Community will be utterly destroyed by Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every last one of you will die! Lord Malevolence has decided to move against Human Community, and soon, all humans in Celestara will be annihilated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't live either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? Is Lord Malevolence planning to move against the Human Community? To wipe out the Human Community of Celestara?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo laughed coldly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, do you want to know? I won't tell you! You can live in fear. Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a disdainful snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't want to talk, right? Too bad, because in front of me, you can't hold out. You'll join them, becoming another member of my Blood Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he flicked a drop of blood towards Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's expression darkened. With his divine power essence destroyed, he was powerless to resist. The blood droplet merged into his body, triggering an agonizing scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This transformation took a considerable amount of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had used three drops of Blood Clan essence on Angelo, finally completing his transformation into a member of his Blood Clan lineage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt it was all worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Angelo was a Deity King and the vice commander of the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also the Grand Elder of the Royston family, one of the most powerful clans in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning Angelo into a Blood Clan member would greatly benefit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what Osborne was most eager to know was about Lord Malevolence's plan to act against Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand dismissively, motioning for Angelo to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inquired with serious expression, "Angelo, tell me everything you know about Lord Malevolence's plans to move against Human Community. Spare no details."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo bowed respectfully, saying, "As you wish, my Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard about this from Aldrich of the Bowman family. Aldrich is currently investigating Tobey's murder within the Royston family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During a conversation with the Royston family head, he inadvertently mentioned that many within Paramount Supreme Clan are plotting to completely wipe out Human Community."</span></p><div class="pagination">
