  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't truly feel the bone-chilling power until the energy of the Frost-kissed Heart coursed through his body. Thankfully, this time, it wasn't a death-dealing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, Osborne found the icy energy oddly comforting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, every single cell in his body sprang to life, hungrily gobbling up the ice energy. With each bit of energy absorbed, he could clearly feel his physical strength ramping up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization hit him like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical body had long since become the Infinite Sacred Body, touching the Sacredness Level. After merging with the World Tree fragment, it had even soared to the mid-Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That put his body leagues ahead of most Empyrean Sacredness powerhouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this state, further enhancing his physical body was an uphill battle. It would take another treasure like the World Tree fragment to make any significant headway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had come to terms with the fact that his physical body's improvement would be on hold for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after absorbing and integrating the power of the Frost-kissed Heart, he could feel his body growing stronger and more powerful, clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling was so intoxicating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!" Osborne couldn't help the moan that escaped his lips, every cell in his body singing with pure, unadulterated pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boost wasn't world-shattering, but it was definitely noticeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered under his breath, "Damn, what a rush!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Frost-kissed Heart juice is like rocket fuel for the body, and it's hitting me ten times harder! Even with my body already jacked up to mid-Sacredness Level, it's still doing this... Give me a few dozen of these babies, and I could break through to late-Sacredness Level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, pure brawn-wise, I'd be toe-to-toe with someone like Ms. Olsen! Maybe even stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of elation coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon enough, he sensed something else stirring deep inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he figured out what it was, he was even more pumped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Fusion Vessel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the depths of Osborne's being resided a spectral image of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, adorned with a single leaf and two radiant blooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two flowers represented the foundational carriers, the bedrock upon which his power was built!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's dark and space elemental essences pulsed within those two flowers, the foundational carriers. The Fusion Vessel acted as the perfect bridge, blending these forces together and allowing him to tap into Sacred Power way ahead of schedule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had pulled out all the stops in an attempt to bolster the Fusion Vessel, yearning for a third flower to bloom, a third foundational carrier to emerge, so he could fuse even more power into the mix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But every attempt ended in failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what he tried, the Fusion Vessel stubbornly refused to sprout that third flower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Adriana from </span><span>the </span><span>Fairy Moon Sect hadn't given him the heads-up, he'd still be stuck with just two fused powers, twiddling his thumbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne realized that after absorbing the Frost-kissed Heart's energy, the Fusion Vessel was undergoing a rapid transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside the two existing flowers, a third one was beginning to materialize, faint but definitely present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third foundational carrier!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't fully formed, just a ghost of what it would be, but it was there, shimmering with potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was beyond ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>This Frost-kissed Heart doesn't just give my physical body a boost, it turbocharges power fusion! And for me, that means my Fusion Vessel is leveling up!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Just one Frost-kissed Heart's worth of juice, and the phantom of the third foundational carrier has already appeared... A few more, and I can definitely solidify it!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Hell, maybe even unlock a fourth! Or a fifth!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath hitched in his throat, his mind racing with possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Adriana's help, Osborne could only fuse power with painstaking effort, relying on his own understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each new fusion was an uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his confidence, he doubted he could fuse a fourth power before hitting Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with a solidified third foundational carrier, Osborne could instantly fuse a fourth power, taking his Sacred Power to </span><span>god</span><span>-like levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Frost-kissed Heart is the real deal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face lit up like a Christmas tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum was burning through Sacred Crystals like there was no tomorrow in his desperate search for the Frost-kissed Heart on the seventh layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm. So far, he'd shelled out over 50 thousand crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been gutted about the massive expenditure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he reckoned it was money well-spent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just 50 thousand crystals for a single Frost-kissed Heart? That was a steal! A real bang for the buck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last drop of the Frost-kissed Heart's energy was slurped up by the blood-red roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left feeling a bit hollow, a tad yearning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed longingly.</span><br><span>"</span><span>If I had dozens, hell, even hundreds of these Frost-kissed Hearts! Heck, just ten would do the trick. After soaking up all that energy, the third foundational carrier would solidify for sure, and I could fuse a fourth power!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly pulled himself together.</span><br><span>If there's one Frost-kissed Heart here, there's bound to be more. Maybe a second, a third, or even a fourth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I've got Satan's Eye. What's there to be scared of? I'll ransack this whole snow-covered mountain until I find enough Frost-kissed Hearts.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that determination, Osborne hit the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't you forget! If you find another Frost-kissed Heart, it's my turn to use it. Don't leave me in the cold," Primordial hollered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, yeah, I got it," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about having to share with Primordial made him even more antsy. He needed to find more of those hearts, and fast, so there'd be enough to go around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Satan's Eye never let Osborne down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially after it leveled up to the Sacredness Level, it had become a real powerhouse. He soon stumbled upon a second Frost-kissed Heart. Osborne gritted his teeth and handed it over to Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial beamed from ear to ear. He sent out roots, wrapped them around the Frost-kissed Heart, and dragged it into Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, ready to savor the energy at his leisure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no choice but to keep on the hunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, fortune finally smiled on him and he stumbled upon a third Frost-kissed Heart. He was walking on air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>There might not be a whole heap of Frost-kissed Hearts around here, but there's enough to go after! If I really put my nose to the grindstone, I might find ten, or maybe even dozens! Keep at it!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne didn't jump right in to soak up the Frost-kissed Heart's power. It took a good few hours to absorb just one, and he only had a maximum of five days in this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to make every single minute count and focus on finding more Frost-kissed Hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the absorption part, after the state duel, he'd have all the time under the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, following in </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> footsteps, Osborne wrapped the Frost-kissed Heart with blood-red roots and hauled it into his body for safekeeping, planning to deal with it later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, he just kept on finding more.</span></p><div class="pagination">
