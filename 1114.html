  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you..." Gerardo stammered, the vitality draining from his face as he stared at Ophelia with a mix of disbelief and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was nothing he could do to stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though she was only Class AAA and hadn't yet broken into Class S, Gerardo was too weak to resist. With a swift motion, Ophelia crushed his insides, snuffing out his life force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As darkness enveloped Gerardo, he felt the world around him fading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian! Who would've thought, after a lifetime of rivalry, I'd end up dead at the hands of a woman instead of you! You never got the satisfaction of killing me yourself. I bet you'll regret that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled bitterly before his head lolled to the side, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sound of footsteps echoed from outside the chamber&mdash;Osborne was on his way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's heart raced as she caught sight of Osborne on the surveillance screen, closing in fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression hardened; she couldn't face him now, especially not as a Class AAA. "I can't let Osborne find out I killed Gerardo!" she thought frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting another second, Ophelia sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pause!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of her hand, she activated her time power. In an instant, the surrounding area froze; everything fell silent, and only Ophelia remained in motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne, who was just outside the door and stronger than Ophelia, stood still, oblivious to the temporal anomaly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia slipped out of the chamber, and as she passed Osborne, she couldn't help but pause, studying his face intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her emotions swirled within her&mdash;conflicted and chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man had once been her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia had pursued him with fervor, and they had shared beautiful moments together. But when she became the heir to the Caldwell family, her ambitions swelled. She controlled billions, and how could she be with a mere orphan without status?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia wanted to build an empire, elevate the Caldwell Group to new heights, and make the Caldwell family a name to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, under pressure from her family, she had pushed Osborne away, suggesting divorce and preparing to marry another heir from a prestigious family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of anger, Ophelia even ordered her bodyguards to beat him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That decision became her greatest regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment on, Osborne soared to new heights, becoming a figure she could only look up to&mdash;if she was even worthy of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that she realized what she had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret washed over her, and Ophelia yearned to make amends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all she received in return was his cold indifference, the sting of rejection piercing her heart. For the first time, she felt what it was like to have her dignity trampled, to be cast aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, anger ignited within Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood that to make Osborne regret his choices, she had to become stronger, rise above him, and then reappear in his life, dazzling and powerful, leaving him in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting her lip, she gazed earnestly at Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That day is coming soon! I will be stronger than you, and when it happens, I'll make sure to see the regret etched on your face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ophelia prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her current power, she could only maintain her time manipulation within a limited area for three minutes. She had to make the most of that scant time and get out of there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A minute had already ticked away; she had two minutes left to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, something shocking happened: her time power suddenly failed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Ophelia was about to bolt, time resumed its steady flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne regained his senses in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He blinked in disbelief as Ophelia materialized right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One minute, his sight was utterly vacant; the next, Ophelia materialized in a mystifying flicker before his eyes. The unexpected apparition left him momentarily stupefied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What just happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was that teleportation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it couldn't be this fast. And why is she here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow furrowed in puzzlement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his expression quickly shifted to icy resolve. "Ophelia, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia mirrored his bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "How could my time power just cut out like that? I just wanted to escape and return to confront Osborne when I was stronger. Why did it suddenly fail, letting him see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic began to seep in, but when she met the coldness in Osborne's gaze, a surge of anger steadied her nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can't I be here? Osborne, we're divorced. Do I need to notify you where I go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell silent, sensing the fierce anger radiating from her. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was different about Ophelia this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And most startling of all&mdash;there was an unmistakable aura of Class AAA power surrounding her!</span></p><div class="pagination">
