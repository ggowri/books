  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whether it was a house cat or a wild one, their lifespans typically ranged from a mere decade to two decades at most. Breeds that lived beyond thirty years were almost nonexistent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet now, Emma was telling Osborne that the cat he was holding was at least three hundred years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief. "You've got to be kidding me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma shook her head, her expression serious. "No joke. The higher-ups in the Augustine family all know about this. Divine Shadow isn't just any ordinary cat; it's incredibly powerful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Powerful, huh? Just how powerful are we talking?" Osborne pressed, skeptical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, let's put it this way: I definitely can't take it in a fight, and neither can anyone else in the Augustine family! As for whether the former Godfather could take it on, I have no idea," Emma replied earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait, what?!" Osborne couldn't believe his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma was a Class AAA powerhouse, one of the elite in the world. If she said she couldn't beat a cat, then this cat must be something else entirely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "Is it some kind of monster?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced at Emma's serious face and realized she wasn't joking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze shifted back to Divine Shadow, who remained comfortably nestled in his arms, its bright eyes half-closed in a lazy demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It looked like any ordinary pet cat, but the thought that this creature could potentially be more powerful than him sent a shiver down his spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, Osborne considered tossing it aside out of sheer instinct, fearing it might swipe at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he held back the impulse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't sense any energy from Divine Shadow, nor did he feel any hostility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed the cat had no intention of harming him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, curiosity gnawed at him. Osborne needed to see if Divine Shadow was truly as formidable as Emma claimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne said, leaning down to look at the cat, "Divine Shadow, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone's saying you're something special. Why don't you show me? I still can't wrap my head around the idea that a cat could be so powerful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Divine Shadow lifted its gaze briefly as if it understood Osborne's words but didn't make a move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling a bit embarrassed, Osborne glanced at Emma, who shrugged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even the former Godfather couldn't command Divine Shadow. If it doesn't want to listen to you, there's not much I can do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a surge of defiance. Without thinking, he flicked his arm, sending Divine Shadow flying through the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Meow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, a sharp, clear meow echoed through the room. Divine Shadow halted mid-air, twisting its body around before extending a paw toward Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A terrifying claw-like force sliced through the air, narrowly missing Osborne's ear and severing a few strands of hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The claw then struck the wall with a resounding thud, leaving a deep gash on the sturdy surface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood frozen, utterly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The speed of the attack had left him completely off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, he believed Emma. This cat was no ordinary feline; it was a creature of immense power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The claw strike hadn't been directed at him but was a warning shot. If it had landed on him, he would have been seriously injured, if not dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whoa!" Osborne gasped, his heart racing as he stared at Divine Shadow, who gracefully returned to his side, leaping back onto his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The cat gave him a sidelong glance, almost as if to say, "Don't try that again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was left speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma, too, was wide-eyed in astonishment. She had only heard the legends about Divine Shadow but had never witnessed its power firsthand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that she had seen it in action, she was equally shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "Is it a monster?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A deity?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or maybe... a Dark Deity?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that thought, a grave expression suddenly took over Osborne's face. His mind raced back to the dungeon where he had faced off against the Dark Deity, Mosley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mosley had been a Dark Deity, yet its true form was nothing more than a gigantic, blood-sucking mosquito.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If a mosquito could be a Dark Deity, then why not a cat?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The idea loomed large in his mind, but Osborne shook his head, unwilling to pursue that thought any further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Deep down, he sensed that Divine Shadow meant him no harm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the cat had existed peacefully alongside the Augustine family for centuries, never causing trouble for anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could it possibly be a Dark Deity?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that reassuring thought, he began to relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "No matter what, Divine Shadow won't hurt me or the Augustine family! In fact, when the time comes, its formidable strength might even help us out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But I can't pin all my hopes on a cat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Grandfather in a coma, the weight of the Augustine family's future rests on my shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I need to level up and break through to Class S!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then will I stand a chance against Gerardo, or the League of Divine Descent, or the Eityreia Organization!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As this realization sank in, his expression turned serious once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emma, you need to go back and focus on your training! I have to make a trip down to the dungeon and check on Clarissa's situation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma nodded obediently and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne cradled Divine Shadow in his arms as he exited Mount Celestial Reach, making his way swiftly to the depths of the dungeon.</p><div class="pagination">
