  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dozen or so Deathborns surrounding Riley and the others were all formidable Deity Overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, one was a late-stage Deity Overlord, flanked by two mid-stage counterparts. Their strength was undeniably impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just five days ago, encountering such a group would have forced Osborne to flee; he wouldn't have stood a chance against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne didn't even need to lift a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spatial Clone!" he murmured, and in an instant, a clone of himself materialized, surging forward with overwhelming spatial energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the outermost early-stage Deity Overlord Deathborns could even let out a scream, they were torn apart by the terrifying force of space, completely obliterated from existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the late-stage Deity Overlord Deathborn had just sent Riley flying, blood spewing from Riley's mouth, and was now lunging at Diana, intent on stopping her breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was at a critical moment, unable to evade the attack, and it looked like the Deathborn was about to strike her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spatial Cleaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that crucial moment, Osborne's Spatial Clone pointed a finger at Diana, and the space around her flickered. In an instant, she was severed from the current reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The attack from the late-stage Deity Overlord Deathborn slammed into where Diana had been, passing right through her without touching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, she had shifted into a different space entirely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Deathborn, caught off guard, paused in confusion, struggling to comprehend what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked back at Diana, only to find her figure fading away, along with the space surrounding her, disappearing from his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only could he not touch her, he couldn't even see her anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His brow furrowed in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's clone seized the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Surrounded by a terrifying aura of spatial energy, the clone unleashed a punch that obliterated an early-stage Deity Overlord Deathborn in one blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a few blinks, the remaining early-stage Deathborns were dispatched, leaving only the three stronger Deathborns behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the destruction of his comrades, the late-stage Deity Overlord Deathborn abandoned all thoughts of the vanished Diana and charged at the clone with blood-red eyes, followed closely by the two mid-stage Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The clone grinned, a glint of excitement in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bring it on! Let's see just how far my power has come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he stood his ground, fists crackling with spatial energy, ready to meet their assault head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ground shook as immense waves of power rippled through the underground space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surrounding area twisted and warped under the force of the clash, sending Riley and the others tumbling back from the shockwave, crashing hard against the rocky walls and leaving them bloodied and stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stared in shock at the epicenter of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the distortion of space settled, they saw a tall figure standing confidently amid the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Osborne's Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of the three Deathborn, two mid-stage ones had been reduced to a bloody mess, while the late-stage Deity Overlord Deathborn lay battered and broken on the ground, writhing in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His crimson eyes locked onto Osborne, filled with hatred and despair, as he let out a wretched, defiant scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next moment, his body disintegrated into a spectral form, merging into the solid rock beneath him, leaving nothing behind but echoes of his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Trying to escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wore a cold smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He relished the power of his recent punch, feeling it matched his expectations. He knew now that he had undergone a tremendous leap in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even a late-stage Deity Overlord wouldn't stand a chance if they tried to confront him directly; they were simply on different levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With my full spatial energy unleashed, I should be on par with an average peak Deity Overlord!" he thought, a satisfied smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the late-stage Deity Overlord Deathborn attempting to flee, Osborne immediately ordered his clone to pursue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most warriors would find little recourse against a Deathborn that had transformed into a spectral form and slipped through the stone walls. Here, the rock was far too solid for even the strongest Deity King warrior to breach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne's clone was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With its spatial power, the clone could traverse both the hard rock and the abyss of space with ease&mdash;and at an even faster speed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Deathborn, in its spectral state, could slip through stone, its pace was sluggish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's clone closed the distance, its arm crackling with spatial energy as it unleashed another punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surroundings fell eerily silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in its spectral form, the late-stage Deity Overlord Deathborn couldn't resist the relentless grip of spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It fell, leaving behind only a single crystalline eye.</span></p><div class="pagination">
