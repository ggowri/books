  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the viewing platform was eerily silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at the battle in the canyon with their mouth wide open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all in deep shock for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since a few minutes ago, when Osborne took out the invisible metahuman sniper, all conversation had ceased as everyone focused intently on the unfolding battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't understand how Osborne had detected the invisible metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The instant annihilation of the six men had everyone exclaiming it was impossible. Yet, that was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, from over a mile away, nearly blew Apollo's head off with a single shot, making Derek's back drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned incredibly solemn and tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, Osborne broke away from his team, darting swiftly to flank Apollo's camp. At the moment Apollo's men relaxed, he fired again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a short span, five of Apollo's elite men were picked off one by one by Osborne's long-range sniping, their deaths gruesome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't even engaged in direct combat, yet Apollo had already lost twelve elite men, reducing his forces by more than a third, leaving everyone on the viewing platform stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The viewing platform buzzed once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the heck is he? Skyefall Security actually has such a formidable sniper? He's already taken out eight of Apollo's elite men, and Apollo hasn't even scratched him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought Skyefall Security was doomed, but I was wrong. With such a lethal sniper, Apollo's in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's practically crippled Apollo's team all by himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What will Apollo do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Apollo going to lose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs of the crowd made Derek's face darken. He clenched his fists tightly, glaring at Osborne, his murderous intent boiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek growled lowly, "Damn it, who is he? Find out immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinates quickly sprang into action, reporting, "Mr. Chevalier, I've found out. He registered as a bodyguard at Skyefall Security just half a day ago, with only a name, Satan. No other information."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Satan? Just half a day ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek gritted his teeth. "Damn it. I don't care who he is. I want him dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His subordinates showed hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, with the six ancient families watching, it's not wise for us to interfere in this battle. Even if we want to take him out, we have to wait until this duel is over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry, I believe Mr. Apollo Chevalier can handle it. Maybe we don't have to take action. Mr. Apollo Chevalier might take care of Satan soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo, don't let me down. If you lose this duel, I won't be able to explain to the Wise Order. You might..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's eyes flashed with cold light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was curious about Osborne's identity, especially since he was wearing a mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Clarissa knew it was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was so nervous her breathing quickened. She clenched her fists tightly, staring unblinkingly at the image of Osborne on the screen, afraid he might get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna exclaimed in surprise, "I never thought Skyefall Security had such a skilled sniper. If I'm not mistaken, his sniper gun is a Class B weapon produced by the Draco Group. Even a Class C plus martial artist would be killed instantly if hit in a vital spot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, she didn't receive a response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puzzled, she looked at Clarissa and asked, "Clarissa, you seem very nervous. Do you know that mysterious sniper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa snapped back to reality and quickly covered up. "No, I don't know him. I just think he's really impressive." After speaking, Clarissa blushed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna didn't think much of it and said gravely, "This duel is hard to predict now. Although Apollo has lost twelve men, his overall combat power still surpasses Skyefall Security. Apollo is enraged and has ordered his men to advance quickly toward the sniper using earth walls and water spheres for protection. That sniper is in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clarissa became tense again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her fists tightly, murmuring, "No, he'll be fine. He must be okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also noticed Apollo's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two metahumans, each supporting an earth wall and a water sphere, completely shielded Apollo's men as they rapidly approached Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to kill me? Not that easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself, quickly rising with his sniper gun in hand. But instead of retreating, he pulled out all the grenades he had, a cold smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Apollo's group was only 1500 feet away from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo, seeing Osborne still in place, was somewhat surprised. Osborne shot at the earth wall, creating craters in it, but it posed no real threat to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo grinned viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they got a bit closer, Osborne would be within his attack range. Being a Class B metahuman, his effective range was up to a thousand feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once within his range, he was confident he could quickly take out Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Almost there. You bastard, you're dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Apollo suddenly felt a surge of danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that among the craters made by the sniper bullets, several dark objects rolled into their midst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo glanced over, and his face changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out for grenades. It was the Draco Group's Class B explosive grenades. Damn it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion rang out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
