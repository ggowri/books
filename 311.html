  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ancient families were able to endure and pass down their legacies for generations because all members shared a common bloodline. They were more united compared to traditional companies or corporations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the distribution of benefits wasn't too skewed, even in the face of intense internal competition, very few individuals would betray the family, collude with external enemies, or take actions that harm the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if the family declined, everyone would suffer the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was not an absolute rule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not everyone considered the long-term consequences. There were always some individuals within the family who prioritized their personal interests over the greater good of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because of such individuals that many ancient families, with legacies spanning hundreds or even thousands of years, eventually fell apart and declined, losing their former glory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the current situation of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The recent difficulties faced by the family were not only due to mysterious external forces targeting them but also because of an internal traitor leaking information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, why did Allen die in the sea?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sea was vast. How did the enemy know when he would set sail, what his route was, and what level of security was around him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An insider was most likely to leak that information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa, who went out to the sea to investigate Allen's death, also encountered an attack and barely made it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, other important members of the family faced powerful attacks whenever they went out to sea, resulting in severe casualties. It is undoubtedly the work of a traitor who betrayed their whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is this traitor?" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, a figure who seemed worthy of suspicion emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he be the traitor? On the surface, he appears gentle and polite, always wearing a smile and never competing for anything. It seems like he doesn't care about the position of the Augustine family's heir. </span><span>However</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the deep within his eyes, I saw a strong sense of discontent and even a hint of coldness! He hides his true thoughts and works hard to maintain his image as a kind and amiable person. He might be the traitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By doing so, no one suspects him," Osborne thought and felt that it was highly possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since there is no breakthrough for the time being, let's consider him as the primary suspect and observe him closely first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made a decision and took action immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated Satan's Eye, and suddenly, the world before him changed. All obstacles </span><span>blocking his vision became transparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his level five Satan's Eye, Osborne possessed an incredibly powerful ability of perspective. Walls of various structures were mere decorations to him. In his eyes, the Augustine Estate appeared transparent, with no corner able to hide from his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne found Ryan in another villa a few hundred yards away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was Isaac's grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was the previous head of the family and resided in a mansion even larger than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Ryan was in the yard, practicing his power diligently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hung a large stone in mid-air with an iron chain and repeatedly applied gravitational force to it, over and over again, until the chain could no longer bear the weight and broke. Then, he replaced it with a smaller stone and continued the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gravity power was strange and powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that the most powerful gravity metahuman could apply a gravitational force to a needle, making it heavier than a mountain and causing even massive iron chains to snap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was still far from that at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The large stone he bound to the iron chain weighed at least 220 pounds, which was roughly equivalent to the weight of an adult. However, when he applied a gravitational force to it, its weight increased by hundreds of times, surpassing ten tons and causing the iron chain to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a person were subjected to gravity manipulation, they would feel the force of over ten tons pressing down on them, making it extremely difficult for them to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only someone like Osborne, who had a strong physique and the strength of a dinosaur, could ignore his gravity power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Ryan continued to exert his gravity manipulation repeatedly, even though his body was soaked in sweat,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though his mental state was so exhausted and filled with pain that his facial expression contorted in agony, Ryan did not stop. He clenched his teeth and continued to exert his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, if a metahuman wanted to improve, they had to practice their powers over and over again like him, to break through their limits and become proficient in their powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's way of improvement was unique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the reason why Ryan pushed himself so hard was because he had experienced a significant stimulation earlier that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gravity power did not affect Osborne at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne's arrival, Ryan had been considered the strongest among the younger generation of the Augustine family. His gravity power was so formidable that even Kaden, who could transform into a giant, was unable to surpass it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he was crushed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unwilling to be a weakling, so he trained relentlessly, hoping to improve rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to Ryan, at that moment, Osborne was closely observing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Osborne wasn't just observing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While observing, he also took out the blood diamonds and madly absorbed the strange energy to enhance his soul of powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, Osborne's power was rapidly advancing towards Class B+, and his strength was improving every minute and every second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of improvement was far beyond Ryan's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Ryan tried his best, the power gap between him and Osborne would not decrease in the slightest. On the contrary, it would only continue to widen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power gap would only get bigger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
