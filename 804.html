  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shook his head. "I can't leave with you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My interdimensional travel isn't advanced enough to bring all of us to Rosmandi in one leap. Once the Williamson family realizes they've lost my trail, they might send a Class S Supreme Overlord to track me down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And then, we're all finished.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But as long as I'm within their sight, they won't rush to act. Even a Class S Supreme Overlord, who values their prestige, won't attack me immediately.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then, I'll get my chance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After you've ensured your safety, I can use Dimensional Space to return to Rosmandi alone. That's our best option."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne finished speaking, and Aleena hesitated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had only offended the Williamson family to help Rhett seek revenge.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leaving Osborne alone to face danger was a burden Aleena couldn't bear, but she knew it was the best plan.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright!" Aleena gritted her teeth. "Just be careful. If anything happens to you, I can't explain it to Mr. Caleb Augustine, nor can I face Godfather."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled lightly, "Don't worry. Killing me won't be that easy. Let's go now. While other superpowers are dispersing, the Williamson family shouldn't dare to pursue us openly."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma was anxious. "I'm not going anywhere! I'm staying to face this with you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shook his head. "It's out of the question!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why? We came here together. I can't abandon you to danger."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne remained firm. "I said no, and that's final. If the Williamson family fails to capture me, they might send a Class S Supreme Overlord to get me personally. Since you can't help me, staying would only slow me down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Plus, with you, my interdimensional travel would drain more energy, and it would take longer to escape. I have no certainty of escaping a Class S Supreme Overlord!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once he'd finished, Emma fell silent, biting her lip and looking at Osborne with worry.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not giving Emma a chance to speak further, Osborne continued, "Enough dawdling. If other superpowers clear out, it'll be even tougher for us to leave safely!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go back to Rosmandi and wait for me. I'll be fine."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's eyes were full of concern, but she finally nodded. "Okay, I'll go back. But you take this. Otherwise, I'm staying."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Emma produced a small shield.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was surprised. "Swallow Shield?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't expected Emma to entrust him with the divine artifact, the Swallow Shield.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take it! If you ever face a Class S Supreme Overlord, the Swallow Shield might buy you a moment's time. If you don't take it, I'll stay by your side and face death with you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne hesitated but eventually nodded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, I'll keep it safe for you. I'll return it to you when I reach Rosmandi."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma finally relaxed, although she knew that, with the Swallow Shield, if Osborne were ever pursued by a Class S Supreme Overlord, he would still be no match, buying only a few extra seconds of life.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma wrapped her arms around him, whispering in his ear, "Be careful, Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you die, I don't want to live. I'll descend into hell, become a demon, and when I've exacted vengeance on the Williamson family for you, I'll come to you. So, you must live!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's body trembled, and he nodded firmly. "I will, for your sake."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne prepared to move, Emma suddenly activated Satan's Eye.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A peculiar energy surged from her Satan's Eye and flowed into Osborne's body.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What is this?!" Osborne exclaimed, astonished.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's cheeks flushed as she explained softly, "This is the energy that can enhance our cognition and improve our mental acuity. I can control it myself, but now I'm giving it all to you. You have to make it back alive."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Emma released Osborne and took his hand. "Let's go!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, still stunned, thought to himself, "Emma just gave me all the energy that could enhance our minds. What about her?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, he had no way to return the energy to Emma.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he could do was nod. "Alright, let's move!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne waved his hand, opening a Dimensional Space. "Hold hands. I'll take you out of here!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In no time, he and the five others stepped into the dimensional rift.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their figures vanished instantly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thirty miles out at sea, their silhouettes reappeared. Osborne's face was pale, clearly showing the strain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Transporting five people through interdimensional travel had taken a severe toll on him. He could manage only two or three more jumps before his mental strength would be utterly depleted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just one more time!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gritted his teeth and tore through space once more, reappearing another 30 miles away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, this is as far as I can take you! Stay safe, everyone!"</p><div class="pagination">
