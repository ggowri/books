  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Maxime and Raoul weren't the only ones taking action. Other warriors from the Mystic Feather Clan rose to the occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a crisis for the Mystic Feather Clan of Wild Flame City, facing total annihilation under the baseless accusations from the Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even their unwavering loyalty to Lord Malevolence demanded that they fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Feather Clan had decent strength, boasting 11 Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While many of their elite members preferred their own family's training over joining the Dark Deity Legion, they still had formidable forces to defend themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by these eleven Deity King warriors, the Mystic Feather Clan managed to stabilize their lines slightly, rallying more clansmen to form defenses and retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, their opponents were stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined forces of the Bowman family, Demonic Dragon Clan, and Soaring </span><span>Lion Clan boasted 20 Deity King warriors, including Aldrich, in the mid-stage Deity King realm,</span><span> and make </span><span>the Mystic Feather Clan's situation dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two sides clashed violently, and the Mystic Feather Clan began to retreat, leaving behind a grim scene of bodies littered across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earth shook under the weight of the ongoing battle, with the energy surges rippling throughout every corner of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Hannah had returned to her manor, her eyes fixed on the sky where chaos reigned. Her body trembled uncontrollably, and tears streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip and retrieved the Dimensional Microcosm from her belongings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of steely resolve, she sent a voice message to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, can you do me a favor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Osborne appeared before her, having received Hannah's message and used interdimensional travel to reach her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up? How can I help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah handed the Dimensional Microcosm to him, her expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please take care of this for me. Inside are over 100 thousand Mystic Feather Clan members, including everyone from the Gellar family! I need you to protect them. Once you find a safe place, let them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated, not accepting the Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to protect the Dimensional Microcosm so you can jump into battle? Do you think that's a good idea? You're only a mid-stage Deity Overlord! Even if you're talented, you could only take on a couple of peak Deity Overlords at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there are over five hundred of those up there! And let's not forget the 20 Deity King warriors! With your current strength, charging into battle would just lead to your own death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression turned distant at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, but I have to go! My grandfather is up there fighting! I'm a part of the Mystic Feather Clan, and right now, my people are being slaughtered. I can't just stand by and watch! Even if it costs me my life, I won't abandon my clan. I have to fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her determination was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at her, the silence between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was precisely because of her spirit that he admired her</span><span> and </span><span>took to her so much</span><span> </span><span>because they were cut from the same cloth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't bear to let Hannah charge off to certain doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep the Dimensional Microcosm for yourself. It contains hundreds of thousands of Mystic Feather Clan members, and I don't want that responsibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's eyes widened in disbelief. "What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "As for saving the Mystic Feather Clan, don't worry. I will save them! Regardless of the outcome, the Mystic Feather Clan has always been friendly toward the Human Community. They've lent us a hand many times in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you, you're my friend! Your grandfather is my elder, so I'll do everything I can to help them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, a cold determination flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bowman family, Demonic Dragon Clan, and Soaring Lion Clan have a total of </span><span>20 Deity King warriors and over two thousand Deity Overlord warriors, including more than five hundred peak Deity Overlords... Do you think if they all died here, it would send shockwaves through Celestara?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said this with a grin, glancing at Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stared at him, bewildered. "W... What did you just say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce and the others exchanged incredulous looks, their expressions a mix of surprise and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you serious? You really want to take them all out? If we do that, we'll be hunted down and put on every wanted list in the realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged nonchalantly. "Wanted? Hunted? That's bound to happen sooner or later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Starting today, let the name of the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings' shine across Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, smugness appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others buzzed with excitement, eager for the fight ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Hannah remained frozen, her mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is Osborne saying? He wants to wipe out all the warriors from the Bowman family, Demonic Dragon Clan, and Soaring Lion Clan? That's 20 Deity Kings and over five hundred peak Deity Overlords!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can he possibly pull that off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why aren't Anastasia, Bryce, and the others questioning him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all seem to believe he can do it. What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah couldn't wrap her head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't offer any explanations. Instead, he commanded, "Everyone, gear up for battle!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
