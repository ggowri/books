  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The war has begun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Far from the battlefield, in a massive palace shrouded in darkness, a tall, striking figure gazed intently toward the distant conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bright eyes seemed to pierce through the billions of miles, witnessing the bloody and brutal scenes unfolding below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night, when will you return? If you don't come back soon, the Human Community will be doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, Isa felt the weight of the situation pressing down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa! Let us join the fight!" A voice filled with urgency broke through her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A similarly tall and perfect figure rushed to her side, sharing her gaze toward the distant battlefield, her expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa turned to see Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Clarissa from Blue Planet had changed significantly; her beauty remained, but she now exuded a maturity that spoke of wisdom and depth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Goddess of Fate, don't rush! It's not our time to fight yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa furrowed her brow. "Isa, please don't call me Goddess of Fate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may have regained my memories from my past life, but I still feel like just Clarissa, not some divine title!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Isa couldn't help but smile, "But you are the Goddess of Fate! You're one of the God of Night's attendants&mdash;Goddess of Fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shot her a playful glare. "I know! I said I remembered my past life! You don't need to keep reminding me! But I really feel like I'm just Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So from now on, don't call me Goddess of Fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa decided not to argue. "Alright! I won't call you Goddess of Fate anymore. I'll just call you Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what about the God of Death and the God of Life? How are they doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa sighed again, saying, "Isa! Emma and Austin don't want you to call them that either! They have their own names now, and if you keep calling them by their old titles, they might get upset, and I won't be able to smooth things over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa laughed. "Okay, okay! I won't tease you anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all are so grown up now, it's like you don't want to remember your past lives at all! I help you regain your memories, and somehow I'm the bad guy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa rolled her eyes, exasperated. "We're not that old! We've returned from the cycle of reincarnation. In this life, we're actually younger than you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why won't you regard me as the sister?" Isa teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa fell silent, knowing she wouldn't win a verbal spar with Isa, even with her regained memories of the Goddess of Fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chuckled and said, "Alright, I really won't tease you anymore! Otherwise, if he finds out, he might think I'm bullying you! If you prefer to use your names from this life, that's perfectly fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned her gaze outside the Sanctum of Night, pointing toward the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at the God of Time... she has a new name in this life too&mdash;Ophelia! But she doesn't want us to call her Ophelia; she insists on being called God of Time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shrugged, continuing, "She even sealed away the consciousness that belonged to Ophelia in this life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa frowned, glancing in Ophelia's direction. "Isa, should we really ignore her? She's been blocking the entrance for quite a while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied, "She's here looking for the God of Night. What does that have to do with us? I've already told her the God of Night isn't here, but she doesn't believe me. What more can I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa seemed to want to say something but ultimately held back, letting out a heavy sigh instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, when will the God of Night return?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head. "I don't know. Perhaps the God of Night will never come back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's eyes widened in shock. "What do you mean? The God of Night won't return? Why? Is something wrong?" Her voice was filled with urgency and worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa quickly reassured her, "Don't worry! When I say the God of Night won't return, it's not quite what you think! You'll understand soon enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But tell me, do you want him to come back, or would you prefer he doesn't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, her gaze drifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she shook her head. "I don't know! Logically, as the attendant raised by the God of Night, I should want him back! But... he's so cold, so ruthless. Part of me... doesn't want him to return!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled gently, "Honestly, everyone feels the same way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We want him back, yet we also wish he wouldn't come back...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not dwell on that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still haven't told me how Emma and Austin are doing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa replied, "They're fine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks to your help, they've restored their strength to their previous cultivation levels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded, relief washing over her. "That's wonderful! With all of you back in shape, I can consider my task complete! I finally didn't let him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad I still haven't found the reincarnation of the God of Space</span><span> and God of Life</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps...</span><span>they</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>ve</span><span> already been lost in the cycle of reincarnation, never to return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Clarissa's mood darkened. "The God of Night raised and taught all six of us, and now we're down to four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all Lord Malevolence's fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Clarissa's face twisted with rage, her eyes flashing with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for Lord Malevolence, we wouldn't have entered the cycle of reincarnation at all! The God of Space </span><span>and God of Life </span><span>wouldn't have..." She paused, her voice simmering with anger. "One day, I will kill Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded in agreement. "Absolutely! It's all Lord Malevolence's fault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His days are numbered! Whether the God of Night returns or not, someone will take care of him! Celestara Planet doesn't belong to Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a glint of cold determination flickered in Isa's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked at her, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, she asked, "Isa, when are we going to strike? The God of Light can't hold them off alone for much longer; she's one of us, and we should go help her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head again. "Not yet! Trust me, we'll have our chance to intervene!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And when we do, it might be the moment the true victor emerges!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa frowned. "But when exactly can we make our move?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Clarissa pressing for answers, Isa smiled and said, "It's simple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When Lord Malevolence reveals his trump card... that's when we'll strike!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
