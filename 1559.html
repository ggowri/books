  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, it was clear that Osborne had achieved his goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While many might harbor resentment toward Spark of Blaze or even Osborne himself, very few dared to take action against Spark of Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone considering such a move had to think long and hard about the fates of the Wolfe family and the Keynes family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Spark of Blaze had displayed combat capabilities that far surpassed those of the former top force in the Human Community, the Swift family, establishing itself as a formidable contender among second-tier powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, who could say what other hidden cards Spark of Blaze might still have up its sleeve?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Attacking Spark of Blaze offered no benefits but came with significant risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even a first-tier power wouldn't dare to take such a gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, after today, Spark of Blaze's safety was likely assured for the foreseeable future, allowing it to develop freely for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could also report back to the Wild Flame Army with peace of mind, focusing on his plans to reach Divine Peak Nine and acquire the death scent liquid to fully restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once that was complete, he would be utterly fearless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's head back," Osborne said, waving his hand as he led Darren and the others back to Spark Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once inside the estate, Darren and the others finally removed their masks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had insisted they wear them to maintain an air of mystery, ensuring that other major powers remained uncertain about the true strength of Spark of Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Darren and the others had once been prisoners of war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their previous identities as members of a Human Community resistance group in the West Zone could cause trouble if anyone learned they had recovered their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne had made it clear&mdash;they had to wear masks whenever they showed their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning to Betty, Osborne said, "I'm preparing to report back to the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For the next little while, I might not be able to return to Spark Estate, and I may even be away from Wild Flame City. I'm leaving Spark of Blaze in your hands and Darren's! After today's display, I doubt any major power will dare to provoke us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Plus, with the divine power shield and the Ultimate Malevolence Airship here, you should be able to handle any trouble that comes your way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty's face paled at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, why don't you just resign from the Wild Flame Army? We've already established ourselves in Wild Flame City. Wouldn't it be better for you to stay here and lead us rather than be tied up in the Army?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know you won't get a fair promotion there as a member of the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and shook his head, saying, "That's not an option! As for promotions, I'll handle that myself. I have my own plans. Just focus on running Spark of Blaze. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask Darren."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Betty nodded reluctantly. "Alright, Mr. Augustine, but you have to be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, then pulled out a Dimensional Bag and handed it to Darren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Inside this bag are Essence Crystals. Keep them for emergencies! If you find yourselves in a situation you can't handle, don't hesitate to escape. Your safety is the priority&mdash;everything else can wait until I'm back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Understood!" Darren replied, determination in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Osborne stepped out of Spark Estate, heading toward the outskirts of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His break was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had accomplished what he set out to do and was ready to report back to the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the Army's regulations, since he had broken through to the Celestial Deity realm, his rank would automatically rise, at least to that of a centurion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for higher ranks like chiliarch, leader of ten thousand, or even a general in the Wild Flame Army, he would need to earn those through his own merits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"First stop, the personnel department of the Wild Flame Army. I'll get promoted to centurion first! Once I'm a centurion, I'll be able to command a hundred members of the Wild Flame Army!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne soon arrived at the personnel department of the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because his promotion was based on his cultivation level, the process was straightforward. After verifying that he had indeed reached the Celestial Deity realm, Osborne was officially appointed as a centurion within the Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he changed his name from Lachlan to Osborne in the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer said with a smile, handing him the emblem along with a low-grade Malevolence Airship and a mid-grade Malevolence Amulet, "This is your centurion badge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, you'll be part of the Seventh Division, under the command of Guy Borden, leader of ten thousand! You're in luck&mdash;Mr. Guy Borden personally requested you be placed under his command!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At those words, Osborne couldn't help but frown. "Mr. Guy Borden? He's from the Borden family of the Fero Tiger Clan, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The officer's eyes widened in surprise. "You don't know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Guy Borden is from the most powerful family in the Fero Tiger Clan, the Borden family! He's the second son of Jerome Borden, the family head! His brother Laird is a general in the City Guard, and I've heard that Mr. Guy Borden is expected to be promoted to general soon as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's frown deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Guy is Laird's brother?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Laird doesn't seem to have the best intentions toward me. Plus, marrying off his illegitimate daughter to Calvin didn't help either. I really rubbed Calvin the wrong way last time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy requesting me to join him doesn't bode well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he's just a Deity Overlord in the early stages; how much trouble could he possibly bring?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
