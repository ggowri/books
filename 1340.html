  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strike now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Emperor Dare and a host of assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization sprang into action. They had silently crept up to Osborne's vicinity, and now, with a sudden explosion of movement, they revealed themselves, surrounding him with dozens of deadly figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Apocalypse Harbinger was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's assassins are truly impressive! Their Stealth Arts are on another level! I didn't even notice how they got so close! He is done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, a twisted smile creeping across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's heart dropped as he saw the swarm of </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins, including their leader, Emperor Dare, suddenly materialize around Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watch out!" he shouted, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of their assault was blinding. Masters of the one-hit kill, they struck with such ferocity that Osborne barely had a moment to react. A cacophony of blows rained down upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's form was engulfed, torn apart by the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, to Emperor Dare's surprise, instead of triumph, his expression shifted to one of shock and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something felt off about the way their attacks landed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful! That's not his real body! He's dodged!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Emperor Dare could finish his warning, a chilling sensation rippled through him, raising the hairs on the back of his neck. He turned just in time to hear Osborne's cold voice behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice try, but your Stealth Arts won't fool me! Now, it's time for you to join Eliot in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's fist shot forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emperor Dare attempted to evade, but it was far too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strike shattered his defenses, piercing through his Divine Body and leaving </span><span>a gaping wound in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down in disbelief, shock and confusion filling his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm a top-tier Transcendent Deity warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm one of the best assassins out there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could my assassination fail? And now, my target is behind me, about to finish me off... and I didn't even see it coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dying by the very method he had </span><span>mastered,</span><span> Emperor Dare was filled with bewilderment and resentment. He struggled to turn his head, wanting one last glimpse of Osborne before he died, only to find that Osborne had already vanished from his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne reappeared behind another </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization Transcendent Deity warrior and delivered a brutal kick, turning the assassin's Divine Body into a cloud of blood mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? He just killed a Transcendent Deity in an instant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emperor Dare's eyes widened in disbelief, but darkness quickly closed in around him, snuffing out his consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, Emperor Dare, had met the same fate as Lord League's leader, Eliot, at the hands of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, he had mocked Eliot for being easily defeated by Osborne, calling him worthless. Yet here he was, facing an even quicker demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, none of that mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had unleashed his full fury, mercilessly slaughtering the assassins of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Transcendent Deity warriors could not withstand his onslaught. He tore through their defenses with ease, reducing their Divine Bodies to nothing more than a bloody mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, five </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization Transcendent Deities had fallen to Osborne's relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the remaining assassins began to realize what was happening. Terrified, they huddled together, desperately trying to defend against the unstoppable force that was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So were Apocalypse Harbinger and Nelson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone surrounding Osborne, whether they were from the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, or Lord League, stood in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was annihilating Transcendent Deities with ruthless efficiency!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger gasped, "This can't be?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The cosmic laws on Blue Planet are incomplete, allowing for no more than peak Transcendent Deity cultivation! One must reach </span><span>Celestara</span><span> to break through to the Celestial Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even average Celestial Deities would struggle to annihilate Transcendent Deities so easily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What gives him the edge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger's breath quickened, his eyes flashing with fear before being consumed by a ravenous bloodlust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must kill him at all costs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His murderous intent surged skyward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his teeth fiercely. "Everyone, attack at once! We cannot let him escape; he must perish here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation in the battlefield shifted instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Apocalypse Harbinger's command, thousands of Superior and Transcendent Deity warriors sprang into action, converging on Osborne with wild abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lone man against thousands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One might think Osborne's might would wane before such a force that even a Celestial Deity would be torn asunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne stood unflinching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Guess that's enough testing for now. Time to get serious."</span></p><div class="pagination">
