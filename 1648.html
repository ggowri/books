  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a brief rest, the exploration team geared up to ascend Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This massive floating mountain loomed before them, its sheer size almost surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The edge of Divine Peak Nine was nearly a hundred miles above the ground, and they would need to rely on the Malevolence Airship or their own flight abilities to reach the summit and begin their exploration. Usually, they would fly up the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana turned to Osborne, her expression serious. "Osborne, once we're above Divine Peak Nine, the Deathborn's sensing abilities will be significantly heightened compared to what we experienced below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They'll be able to detect our energy fluctuations from a much greater distance. Because of this, while exploring up there, we can't afford to unleash our divine power for defense. We'll have to keep our energy tightly restrained. If we don't, the Deathborn will pick up on us from far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the ascent itself is risky! When we fly, we'll need to use our divine power, which makes it harder to conceal our energy signatures. If there are any Deathborn nearby, they'll sense us and attack us in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Plus, the fog up there is thicker, which limits our visibility. The Deathborn can hide more easily, making them harder to spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we need to stay on our toes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they began their climb, Diana's demeanor grew increasingly tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The last time she had come to Divine Peak Nine, she had just broken through to become a Celestial Deity. Now, Diana's strength had increased immensely, yet she still didn't underestimate the dangers that lay ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last time, they had the protection of a Deity King warrior and several Deity Overlord-level warriors guarding the miners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, they were on their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I understand," Osborne replied, nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire exploration team activated their divine power and took to the skies. Algernon, leading the way, flew at a slow pace, inching closer to Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The faster they flew, the more divine power they would expend, creating energy fluctuations that could easily attract the attention of nearby Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the thick fog made it difficult to see, increasing the risk of crashing into a Deathborn army if they flew too quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This kind of mishap had happened before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having already been to Divine Peak Nine twice, Algernon was well aware of the dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under his guidance, the group steadily approached the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they gained altitude, the air around them grew noticeably colder, sending a chill through their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his strength, the temperature change didn't affect him at all; even if it dropped tenfold, he wouldn't feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there was something else&mdash;a strange chill creeping into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The change wasn't due to temperature fluctuations; it was the distinctive aura of Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, it's perfectly normal! Even Deity King warriors feel a bit of a chill when they ascend Divine Peak Nine. You'll get used to it," Diana whispered reassuringly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling a bit more at ease, yet the chill in his heart kept him on high alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't resist activating his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were about to set foot on Divine Peak Nine, and he knew better than to let his guard down. The fog was too thick; if any Deathborn were hiding nearby, even he wouldn't be able to see them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he activated his Satan's Eye, Osborne scanned the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, his expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne transmitted a quiet warning to Diana. "Be careful, there are Deathborns nearby!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Over there, six of them&mdash;one is a low-level Deity Overlord, and the other five are at the peak of Celestial Deity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana followed his gaze but saw nothing; the thick fog obscured her view completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trusting Osborne's instincts, she became alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Should we warn Algernon and the others?" Diana suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment before shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's just six Deathborns. They won't pose much of a threat to the team. I'd like to see how they handle themselves against opponents like these. If they can't manage this kind of encounter, then it might be best for us to part ways and operate independently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana considered his words and nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued to keep an eye on the six Deathborns. It was clear they had sensed the energy fluctuations caused by the team's flight and had been drawn to the team. Rather than closing the distance, they had held back, presumably assessing the explorers' strength before quickly taking cover and disguising themselves as the team approached Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's surprise deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "They're setting up an ambush!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Deathborn of Divine Peak Nine are as clever as any of the hundred tribes! If I didn't have my Satan's Eye, there's a good chance I would've walked right into their trap here in this fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their sharp senses and stealth abilities make them incredibly tricky!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the team readied themselves to land on Divine Peak Nine, Osborne's mind raced with strategies and contingencies.</span></p><div class="pagination">
