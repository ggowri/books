  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at her words. "Do you know the location of this Umbra Earth? Can you tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda stared at him incredulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not seriously thinking of exploring Umbra Earth, are you? You'd be better off finding a pillow and having a nice dream. That place is a treasure trove!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, it's all locked down by the Royal Families of the elves and the Ethereal Elven Temple! Only their people and those they allow can venture near it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about you? Do you have some kind of powerful background?" She raised an eyebrow. "If not, it's best you stay put and stop dreaming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "Locked down? So only the Royal Families and Ethereal Elven Temple can organize expeditions to that Umbra Earth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts drifted to Desmond and Joanna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "Maybe they returned from a recent trip to explore Umbra Earth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given how disheveled they looked, they must have faced some serious challenges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounds like they left empty-handed and suffered significant losses. No wonder Desmond was so furious and had it out for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne looked back at Alfreda, the excitement in his eyes grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Alfreda, you're part of the Royal Family! The Nature Elf Clan might have fewer members, but you still hold royal status! You could facilitate an expedition to explore Umbra Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda froze for a moment, her eyes widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she shook her head vigorously. "No way! Not a chance! That's way too dangerous! So many teams have gone in and come back with nothing but losses! I heard that two princes from the Storm Elf Clan died, and one princess from the Sylvan Elf Clan as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to be next in line!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their Royal Families are much stronger, and the teams they send are </span><span>more </span><span>formidable. Even they lost members over there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm staying here at my little inn, thank you very much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda shook her head fiercely, her expression filled with resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "This girl is really afraid of dying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if she's so scared, how could she ever raise her cultivation level and strength? Risk and opportunity go hand in hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he thought quickly about how to convince her to join forces for an expedition to Umbra Earth, Osborne realized that if he could team up with Alfreda, he might just get a shot at the treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter how he reasoned with her, Alfreda remained resolute, shaking her head and adamantly refusing to take any risks exploring Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt like he was running out of steam trying to persuade her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I know you want to join the expedition I would lead to Umbra Earth, but believe me, it's a pipe dream! Umbra Earth is incredibly dangerous, and you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just an Ascension One Supernal Deity King! In that place, you wouldn't even qualify as cannon fodder! You'd need to be at least an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King to have any chance of keeping yourself safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even then, Ascension Four isn't foolproof. Ascension Five could easily meet their end over there...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So for your own safety, forget about that Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm done with this conversation. I'm off to get some rest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more beauty sleep, the cuter and prettier I'll be! You stay put, and I'll come find you when I'm bored."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda jumped up and bounced away, leaving Osborne in a state of bemusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alfreda refusing to form a team for the Umbra Earth expedition, Osborne knew he had to come up with a different plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it wasn't just the Nature Elf Clan that had the privilege to explore Umbra Earth; other elven Royal Families, the Ethereal Elven Temple, and even powerful factions from other races were also involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I've got to find a way to join one of their exploration teams!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My cultivation level is just too low! They'll probably look right past me the moment they see I'm only at Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I can't afford to reveal my hidden strengths either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, having crossed Prince Desmond, I doubt any team would want me on board..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, today is just my first day in Elf City. No need to rush! There might be changes on the horizon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I can find treasures elsewhere that could help me quickly boost my cultivation level. I might not even need to risk it at Umbra Earth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne decided to take a more relaxed approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He set out to explore other parts of Elf City, eager to familiarize himself with his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elf City was a breathtaking place, composed of countless towering Elf Trees, their massive trunks intertwined to form pathways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he left Alfreda's Elf Tree behind, he ventured deeper into the vibrant city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything around him was astonishing, as if he had stepped into a fantastical realm filled with sights he had never encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his amazement, he noticed that the Elf Trees bore fruit&mdash;Elf Fruits that pulsed with rich energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one of those could surely enhance one's strength, but each fruit was protected by the tree's energy. Any attempt to pluck one would set off an alarm, attracting the attention of Elf City's guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't dare act recklessly; he kept his hands to himself, content to admire from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he reached the heart of Elf City, where the atmosphere buzzed with life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, he finally encountered a diverse array of elves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elf Race, while not the most powerful in the cosmos, was undoubtedly the most beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each elf was a stunning sight, perfectly embodying human ideals of beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of captivating faces around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also spotted many other cosmic races, including the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Interestingly, aside from the Human Community, which bore a striking resemblance to the elves, other races had transformed their appearances to resemble the Elf Race while in Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued his exploration, he stumbled upon a massive Elf Tree bustling with activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The canopy resembled a lively marketplace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine artifact! A damaged Apex divine artifact for just ten million Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mid-grade Spatial Translocator, only one million Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, available for hire to undertake guard duties. One hundred Celestial Crystals per month!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lively scene left Osborne in awe, reminiscent of a bustling market back on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here, everyone was a warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most were Supernal Deity Kings, and he even spotted a few Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't yet encountered anyone with a higher cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After scanning the area quickly and not finding anything that piqued his interest, he turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was of the essence&mdash;he had only a month!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a month, the Paramount Supreme Clan would launch a full-scale war, and the Dark Deity Legion, numbering over 50 billion, would unleash chaos on the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to focus on raising his cultivation level as much as possible before heading back to join the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no point in lingering here; I need to focus on my training."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to step away, a voice filled with surprise and delight rang out. "Osborne?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
