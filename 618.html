  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent said excitedly, "Godfather, you mean as long as I can finish in the top two in the heir selection, one of these two divine artifacts will belong to me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you get first place in the heir selection, you'll get any one of them. If you come in second place in the heir selection, you'll get the one that's left over from being picked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why you should all try your best!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone will have a chance. Only the best can have divine artifacts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was instantly excited and looked at Emma and Osborne with wariness in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, Owen, and Lance were full of fighting spirit at this moment. They were silently swearing in their hearts that they would definitely come in the top two of the heir selection and grab the divine artifacts in the hands of Emma and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, only Emma and Osborne felt the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and Lance would fight tooth and nail to get the divine artifacts, and they would never let the others become the top two easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the two quickly calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma said indifferently, "I didn't have much expectation for the position of the heir of the Augustine family, but now, in order to keep the swallow shield, I can only do my best to become the first place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys don't try to take away my swallow shield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent smiled calmly after hearing this, "Emma, you are overconfident. The first place of the heir selection will be destined to be mine! This swallow shield also belongs to me, after all, and they are just temporarily placed in your place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should keep it for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew smiled, "Emma, you're too young, so you should leave such a valuable divine artifact to us for safekeeping."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen said indifferently, "Everyone will get a chance, so let's just see what we can do. Even if I don't get the swallow shield, Goddess of Grain's sickle will be fine for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon saying that, he stared coldly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma grunted coldly. "Just see what we can do! Anyway, if you guys want the swallow shield, show me all you've got to convince me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said indifferently, "As for something that has entered my pocket, no one can snatch it away from me unless I actively give it away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all six of them were motivated by the belonging of the two divine artifacts. They all wanted to beat the others and get the divine artifacts in the next heir selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let me tell you about rules for the heir selection," Godfather finally said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six of them stopped at once and looked at Godfather seriously, expecting the rules for the next heir selection to be more favorable to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather said calmly, "You are the most outstanding young generation of the Augustine family, and you should also know that the Augustine family has an enemy named the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Godfather spoke of this, all six of them were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surprise showed on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that their heir selection next had something to do with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all frowned tightly, feeling the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather continued, "Decades ago, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were the underground king of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. They were brutal, evil, and bloodthirsty, and for some reason, I chose to be an enemy of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and led the Augustine family to destroy them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, I wasn't strong enough back then, and I didn't behead the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, letting him escape from </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, after decades of recovery, under the leadership of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> have regained their power, and they are even stronger than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They never gave up on returning to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, and they never gave up on getting revenge on the Augustine family. Now, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> are about to return to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, or they have already returned to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, they will definitely seek revenge on us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Augustine family fails to defeat them, there will only be one outcome awaiting us, and that is extinction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of which, Godfather looked incredibly serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders of the Augustine family also looked serious at this moment, and they could obviously feel the enormous pressure that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were putting on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six of them tensed up at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather continued, "If the Augustine family is destroyed by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, it will become pointless for all six of you to compete for the position of the heir of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, for this heir selection, I wish all six recognized heirs to go to the front line of the battle against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and fight them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is going to be a brutal war, a bloody war between the Augustine family and the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! I wish you to go to the front line of the war to defend the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> from </span><span>their attacks and protect our industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ultimately, your rankings will be determined by your performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the industry you are responsible for securing is attacked by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, you will be deducted points, and the more important the industry you lose, the more points you will be deducted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the same time, you will receive a certain </span><span>amount</span><span> of points for each of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' enemies you kill. The stronger the enemy, the more points you will get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, all of your performance will be converted into corresponding points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, when this battle is over, the person with the highest total points out of the six of you will be awarded first place, and he can become the first heir of the Augustine family and be qualified to pick the divine artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you understand everything?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
