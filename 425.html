  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's expression became surprised and a little confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at his nose. "Me? I'm the traitor? Mr. Augustine, are you mistaken?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, anyone who saw Ryan's expression would not suspect that he was a traitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So everyone looked at Osborne in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you mistaken? How could Ryan be the traitor? He never contacts anyone outside and has been with us all this time, either practicing or guiding us in our practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could he be the traitor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa frowned. Even she didn't believe that Ryan was the traitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, Kaden, and Queenie also nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, it must be a misunderstanding. I would rather believe that I am the traitor. For example, I accidentally told the Augustine family's secrets while talking in my sleep. I don't believe that Ryan is the traitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is the strongest among the younger generation of our family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Except you, of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan didn't believe it either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Brian frowned and said, "Osborne, are you sure? How could Ryan be the traitor? During this period, Ryan has never left the Augustine Estate alone. He is the most diligent person. He is also the grandson of Isaac. I don't believe he is the traitor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan bit his lips tightly, with tears in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he felt that Osborne had wronged him and felt very aggrieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled without explaining and looked at Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing his eyes, Isaac took a deep breath and then calmed himself down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Osborne, you said Ryan is the traitor of the Augustine family? Do you have any evidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Of course, there is evidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac gritted his teeth and said, "Okay, show me the evidence. If Ryan is the traitor, I... I will personally punish him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, even you don't believe me?" Ryan said with tears in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up." Isaac stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan looked at Osborne angrily. "Since you say I am the traitor, then show me the evidence. I will see what evidence you can provide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Don't worry. Since I dare to say such things, of course, I have evidence. To be honest, I suspected you on the first day I came to the Augustine family. Later, I observed you for many days and even brought you with me. Gradually, I let go of my suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel that there is nothing suspicious about your actions. You never leave the Augustine Estate, and you never contact anyone outside. You only practice diligently. During that time, I trusted you completely and put the focus of my suspicion on others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan gritted his teeth and said, "Why are you doubting me now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because no matter how well you disguise yourself, you will be exposed in the end. Do you still remember the defense layout I showed you three days ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face changed, but he still said calmly, "Do you suspect that I leaked the defense layout?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "That's right. I suspect the defense layout was leaked by the traitor because the second wave of enemies came from the area where our defense was the weakest. If I hadn't rushed over to stop them in time, the enemy would have at least controlled one of our cruise ships. By then, they would have threatened the thousands of passengers on the cruise ship, and we would have been in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan said coldly, "Just because they came in from a weak point in the defense, you suspect that the defense layout has been leaked and I am the traitor? I'm not the only one who has seen the defense layout, right? Everyone in this room has seen it. Why do you just suspect me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ryan finished speaking, Nathan, Queenie, and others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all seen the defense layout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and said calmly, "Because the defense layout you saw is different. I have prepared several different defense layouts. There will be a weak defense spot in different positions on each layout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The enemy entered through the weak defense spot in the layout of yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others were all surprised. "The defense layouts we saw are different? Osborne, you let us see the layouts because you have long suspected that there is a traitor among us, and you want to find him this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan argued, "Just because of this, you say I'm the traitor? That's a bit far-fetched, right? Couldn't the enemies find the weak defense spot themselves and it just happened to coincide with the layout I saw?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have never contacted the outside world these days. They can all testify to this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other people nodded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Ryan has been with us these past few days, even sleeping with us. I can testify for him that he has no chance to contact the outsiders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled again, "Are you sure he has no chance to contact the outsiders? Do you know how he contacts them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was stunned. "Osborne, do you know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I already know it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "On the surface, Ryan has no chance to contact the outsiders, but he has used special methods to spread the secrets of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The way he contracted them is so simple that I almost didn't notice it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every time Ryan practices, he is conveying information to the outsiders."</span></p><div class="pagination">
