  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback when he discovered that his spatial power was ineffective against the humanoid stone giant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't pull the Miracle Elixir from its surface in one piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on?" he muttered, furrowing his brow in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a serious problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without his spatial power, he would have to forcibly rip the Miracle Elixir away, and that meant losing a significant portion of its potency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was not the outcome Osborne had in mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he noticed a commotion in the distance. Edison and his group were closing in fast, their eyes gleaming with excitement as they spotted the giant stone figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miracle Elixir!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's really Miracle Elixir! Three of them!" Edison exclaimed, practically vibrating with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Red, blue, and white! How bizarre that all three types are growing on this giant! But they're ours!" he continued, his voice filled with eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Edison spoke, he suddenly noticed a figure near the stone giant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had already used the Eclipsing Mantra to disguise his appearance and mask his energy signature. Caught up in the excitement of the Miracle Elixirs, Edison hadn't spotted him right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he saw Osborne attempting to harvest the red Miracle Elixir, his expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! There's a third party involved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While we've been busy dealing with the Deathborn, this guy sneaks in to take the Miracle Elixir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's asking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him! Don't let him take that Elixir!" Edison shouted, his voice sharp with anger as he charged toward Osborne, his gaze fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So much for sneaking in unnoticed; Edison had found him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he was discovered, so what? Edison wasn't Angelo; he was just a peak Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him were only a couple of other peak Deity Overlords and less than ten in the late stages, along with a handful of weaker fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, Osborne spotted Athena and Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's eyes were wide with excitement as he stared at the white Miracle Elixir, his breath quickening, his body trembling with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The white Miracle Elixir! I can't believe it! This is the one that can heal all wounds! Just a little bit of it, and my divine power essence will be restored! I'll regain my strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin was practically bouncing on his feet, itching to rush forward and swallow the white Miracle Elixir whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held back, waiting for the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Edison and his team were already closing in, intent on eliminating Osborne and claiming the Miracle Elixirs for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, a cold smile dancing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do they really think they can stop me from getting the Miracle Elixir with just this ragtag crew? They must be dreaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Clone!" he murmured, and in an instant, four duplicates of himself sprang into existence nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stone giant's bulk concealed the process from Edison and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Block them!" Osborne ordered, and the four Spatial Clones charged out from behind the giant stone, racing toward Edison and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison's face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They clearly hadn't anticipated that four more Osbornes were lurking behind the giant stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the clones rushing at them, they had no choice but to prepare for battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight erupted into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't concern himself with the battle of his clones. Those four duplicates were more than capable of dealing with Edison and his crew. If he wanted to, the four clones could easily wipe the floor with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had no intention of doing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed these people alive to help Angelo delve deeper into the Divine Peak Nine and support him in battle until Angelo took down a Deity King-level Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment, four of his clones were holding Edison and his group back without even breaking a sweat, ensuring they couldn't get any closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne's mind raced with how to secure the three Miracle Elixirs intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I can't pull them out by their roots, I might as well take the entire humanoid stone! There's something off about this stone&mdash;it can nullify my spatial power, which means it's a treasure on par with an Ultimate Divine Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking this stone means taking the three Miracle Elixirs with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea sparked a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his Dimensional Space, and a massive rift quickly enveloped the humanoid stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, the stone vanished, taking the three Miracle Elixirs with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart leaped with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been worried that the humanoid stone might not fit into his Dimensional Space, but fortunately, that concern was unfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It worked! Now, I need to get out of here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Angelo catches up, even with my Supreme Malevolence Sword and Spatial Clones, I'm no match for him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as he was about to make his move, Calvin's furious voice echoed through the area, "He took the Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
