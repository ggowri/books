  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Golden flames?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph furrowed his brow as he watched Osborne's soul power burn. This was something he had never encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, when a person's soul power ignited, it lacked color, but Osborne's was glowing a brilliant gold. How peculiar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Adolph didn't dwell on it for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had unwavering confidence in his Divine Ascendance Technique. With Osborne's fragment of soul power captured, he was certain that his Soul Spark Oblivion would obliterate Osborne completely from this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burning of soul power wouldn't cease until every last trace of Osborne's Soul Current Ocean was turned to nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Soul Current Ocean was gone, so would Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne felt the intense strain of his soul power burning away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were just this fragment being consumed, he wouldn't have been too concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, compared to the vast expanse of his Soul Current Ocean, this fragment was insignificant. But at that moment, his true self, located billions of miles away on a divine peak in the North Zone, suddenly froze mid-action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An invisible force surged from the distant East Zone, wrapping around his mind and snaking through his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the golden flames enveloped Osborne's head, and his expression twisted in agony as sharp pain coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly settled into a meditative posture, reaching out with his senses to connect with his Spatial Clone in the far-off East Zone. The truth hit him like a freight train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Ascension Two Supernal Deity King majored in soul power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soul Spark Oblivion?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This technique can ignite my Soul Current Ocean through just a fragment of my soul power? How is that even possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was grave, but he didn't panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most would have succumbed to despair in such a dire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne was merely in the advanced Deity King Level, while his attacker was a formidable Ascension Two Supernal Deity King. The gap in their power was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this was a Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;there was no way to defend against such a soul-level assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Soul Current Ocean ablaze, it was only a matter of time before it was completely consumed, and that meant death for anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need to fight off this soul attack or extinguish the flames engulfing his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why? Because he possessed the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having merged with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity at eight layers, Osborne was practically immortal. Even if his Soul Current Ocean was entirely incinerated, he could swiftly recover through the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, while he felt the pain tearing through his soul, he remained remarkably composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even found time to ponder the mechanics of Soul Spark Oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This soul attack is impressive! It ignites the enemy's soul power, allowing the flames to spread into their Soul Current Ocean. Once the soul power is ablaze, it doesn't matter where the true self hides; eventually, the Soul Current Ocean will be consumed! I could really use a powerful soul attack like this. If only I could learn Soul Spark Oblivion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused but soon shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too difficult!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soul Spark Oblivion was a Divine Ascendance Technique wielded by Adolph, the Ascension Two Supernal Deity King. For Osborne to learn it, he would have to defeat Adolph and seal away his memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then, with Osborne's extraordinary comprehension, could he hope to grasp such a technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Adolph was an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Osborne's current strength, even facing an Ascension One Supernal Deity King would be a daunting challenge, let alone someone of Adolph's caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Adolph stood there and allowed him to attack, it was unlikely Osborne could land a killing blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, how could he possibly defeat Adolph?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he gain access to Adolph's memories to comprehend Soul Spark Oblivion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, trying to suppress these unrealistic thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an unexpected turn of events unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the floating mountain in Wild Flame City, located in the East Zone, the fragment of Osborne's soul power continued to burn, its golden flames dazzling and mesmerizing, drawing the attention of everyone from the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames had been raging for over a minute, yet Osborne's soul fragment showed no signs of being consumed. The fire remained vibrant and fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's shock was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?! My Soul Spark Oblivion is a Divine Ascendance Technique! Even an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King at my level would pay a heavy price if ignited by my soul flames!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity King-level warrior's Soul Current Ocean would be obliterated in an instant under my Soul Spark Oblivion! Yet this fragment of Theodore's soul power has been burning for a minute and is still not extinguished?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just how powerful is this Theodore's soul power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's expression shifted between disbelief and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is definitely an anomaly! I need to dive into his Soul Current Ocean and see for myself what's going on!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
