  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The items in the second shop were relatively singular, consisting entirely of various bones. Even with the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings, Osborne still couldn't identify many of the bones, having no idea which creatures they belonged to.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, most of these bones were currently exuding an extremely intense Sacred Power aura, as if they belonged to some powerful Empyrean Sacredness creature.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bones of powerful Empyrean Sacredness creatures can be used to forge Sacred Artifacts, making them highly valuable materials.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with just a glance, Osborne noticed that most of the so-called Empyrean Sacredness bones in this shop were actually fake, synthesized through special methods.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many of them weren't even real bones at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Osborne stopped in his tracks because he noticed something special among a pile of seemingly worthless bone fragments.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What made it special was that Osborne couldn't see through it even with his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This item carried an extremely peculiar energy, one that Osborne couldn't sense directly but could faintly detect through his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is this?" Osborne observed calmly, pondering its origin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From its appearance, it seemed to be a creature's tooth, extremely sharp, shaped like a slightly curved dagger, with no energy fluctuations on its surface.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne knew that anything even Satan's Eye couldn't see through must be extraordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you interested in this?" the shop owner asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a fat man, clearly a swindler, with a smile that seemed like he'd spotted someone clueless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued, "The Empyrean Sacredness bones I have here are top-notch! They can be used as crafting materials to forge Sacred Artifacts or be integrated into Sacred Artifacts to enhance their power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The most important thing is, they're affordable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I collected all these from a massive cave on a resource planet. That cave looked like the dwelling of some extremely terrifying creature, and these bones were left behind after it devoured its prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All of them are genuine Empyrean Sacredness bones. If you don't believe me, feel free to have someone test them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you fancy anything, let me know, and I can give you a price."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't believe my stuff is real, just leave. Good things are only meant for those destined to have them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The boss finished speaking and leisurely sat back in his chair, as if completely unconcerned about his goods not selling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "Can I take a closer look?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The boss casually waved his hand and said, "Feel free!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately crouched down, casually picked up a so-called Empyrean Sacredness bone, and pretended to examine it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, all his attention was focused on that tooth-like bone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, are you interested in these things? Do you actually know forging?" Leroy asked softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "I'm just looking around. Don't mind me, go ahead and browse. If there's something you're unsure about but really want to buy, you can come to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he continued to pretend to examine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he quickly communicated with Primordial in his mind. "Primordial, do you recognize that tooth-like bone?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That tooth-like bone? It's quite ordinary, no energy fluctuations at all. It might have once been the tooth of some Empyrean Sacredness creature, but now it's long decayed and lost its power, not of much use," Primordial replied casually.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, most of the so-called bones in this shop are fakes. A few pieces are real, but they've already lost their Sacred Power, and the added components later are worthless! This is practically a fake goods shop!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement with </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> other opinions but had a different view about that tooth-like bone. "You're right, but I think that tooth-like bone isn't simple. Even my Satan's Eye can't see through it. But I can sense a special energy within it. This energy gives me an extremely dangerous feeling! And staring at it for too long even makes my Satan's Eye feel a bit of pain."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne described his feelings in detail, which immediately piqued </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> interest. "Even your Satan's Eye can't see through it? And there's a special energy that's unperceivable? But staring at it for too long causes your Satan's Eye to feel pain? This is indeed quite interesting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial became interested, started observing more carefully, and silently pondered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne did not disturb him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Primordial couldn't identify the origin of that tooth, Osborne still planned to buy it for future research.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, anything that even Satan's Eye can't see through is definitely a treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just by its shape, it looked like a massive dagger. Osborne thought it could be directly hung on the Warfare Ancient Tree to let the tree nurture it for a while.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps this way, he might truly obtain a decent Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you taken a liking to anything?" the shop owner asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was ready to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He casually picked up a fake Empyrean Sacredness bone and calmly asked, "How much for this Empyrean Sacredness bone? I plan to take it back and have the elders of my sect refine it. It should reach the quasi-Sacred Artifact level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quasi-Sacred Artifact?" The owner sneered, "My Empyrean Sacredness bone, combined with some other materials and casually refined, would at least become a Sacred Artifact! And you want to use it to make a quasi-Sacred Artifact? Isn't that a waste?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "I lack the strength to handle a true Sacred Artifact. Besides, I don't have much money. If this Empyrean Sacredness bone is too expensive, then forget it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he got up and prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey! Don't rush. I haven't given you a price yet!" The owner's eyes darted around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Empyrean Sacredness bone Osborne had his eye on was actually a fake, costing only a dozen Sacred Crystals. Although the owner wanted to quote a high price, he was afraid of scaring Osborne away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, he said, "We&rsquo;re destined to meet, so I&rsquo;ll sell it to you at a discount! This Empyrean Sacredness bone is top-notch! Thirty thousand Sacred Crystals, take it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned after hearing that. "Thirty thousand Sacred Crystals? Impossible! It's just an Empyrean Sacredness bone. I don't want it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he pretended to leave again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The owner quickly said, "Hey! What price would you accept? Name your price. If I can agree, I'll sell it to you. If not, then you can leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately put on a pained expression. "Five hundred Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew in his heart that this fake Empyrean Sacredness bone was worth no more than ten Sacred Crystals. The reason he offered such a high price was to keep the owner from noticing his true intention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Five hundred Sacred Crystals? Impossible!" the owner shouted. "At least fifteen thousand Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way, I'll offer at most six hundred Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, twelve thousand Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After some haggling, they finally settled on twelve hundred Sacred Crystals. On the surface, both Osborne and the owner looked pained, as if they had suffered a loss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in reality, both were secretly overjoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out twelve hundred Sacred Crystals, just about to hand them to the owner, but suddenly pulled his hand back and said, "No! I feel like I'm losing out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Throw in that pile of useless bones too! This is over a thousand Sacred Crystals, just for one Empyrean Sacredness bone. I can't explain this when I go back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Give me this pile of useless bones, and I'll feel better! Otherwise, I won't buy it..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The owner frowned immediately upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, he still nodded. "Alright! I really can't do anything about you. I'll throw in this pile of useless bones for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Give me the Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately said, "Deal!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
