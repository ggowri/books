  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen?! Is that really Ms. Olsen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my gosh! Even Ms. Olsen is here! It's been ages since she took an interest in Peak Seven, hasn't it? I can't believe she showed up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After our dismal performance in the last two sect competitions&mdash;seriously, we didn't even make the top twenty&mdash;she must have been pretty disappointed. It's no wonder she stepped back from her duties. She tried so hard to turn things around for us but ended up feeling humiliated, so she focused on her own cultivation instead..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not forget, Ms. Olsen is the youngest Peak Lord in our Mystic Sirius Sect! She also got a position in the Glorious Divine Kingdom! With her pride, how could she stick around when Peak Seven kept letting her down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with excitement and speculation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly shifted his gaze to where the voice came from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a woman who looked to be in her mid-twenties, though only she knew her real age. Her face was cold and stern, exuding an air of authority that commanded respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne saw her, it was like a colossal mountain had suddenly risen right in front of him&mdash;daunting and impossible to scale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What an insane amount of power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down Osborne's back, and he couldn't bring himself to look her in the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is she Angela, the Peak Lord of Peak Seven?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Elders of Peak Seven were also Empyrean Sacredness warriors, but Osborne didn't feel much pressure from them. However, the energy Angela gave off made it a struggle for him to catch his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, trying hard to pull himself together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a real heavyweight, a top-notch expert!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good day, Ms. Olsen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, everyone around the arena quickly bowed to Angela, their faces full of deep respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved her hand nonchalantly and said, "Let's get the assessments rolling again! I'm looking forward to seeing how well you young folks can do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, she gave Anastasia, Zoe, and the others an approving look. Actually, she'd been there for a while, just keeping a low profile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wooden Golem on the stage was her own creation. </span><span>So</span><span> when Bryce first knocked it out, she just had to check it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she watched as Diana, Hannah, Mila and the rest took down her Golem with ease, and Angela was more and more amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was </span><span>well aware</span><span> of just how powerful her Wooden Golems were. To beat one at the same cultivation level meant these kids already had pretty decent combat skills compared to others on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to take it down in one blow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a clear sign of being a top-notch fighter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela just couldn't hold back any longer and decided to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would you guys be up for coming back to the arena and taking on my Wooden Golems again?" she asked Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia frowned a little and replied coolly, "No need really. These Wooden Golems are... a piece of cake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped in shock at her bold words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A piece of cake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela, though, didn't get mad. Instead, she smiled at what Anastasia said, "You're spot on! These Golems are a bit too easy for you! So, here's the deal&mdash;I'll crank up their cultivation levels. If you're at Ascension Three, the Golem will be at Ascension Four. If you're at Ascension Four, the Golem will be at Ascension Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about it? Wanna go another round with the Wooden Golem? If you win, I'd love to take you under my wing. And if you're not keen on being my students, I've got other sweet rewards up my sleeve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped again at Angela's offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is Ms. Olsen really thinking of taking on some disciples? No kidding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knows Ms. Olsen has sky-high standards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hasn't taken a single disciple in ages! And now, it seems like some of them might actually become her pupils?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, the onlookers' eyes turned to Anastasia and the others, full of envy and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia and her companions exchanged nervous looks and glanced at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Osborne finally spoke up, "Since it's Ms. Olsen's wish, you should give it a go! Show her what you're made of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing!" Anastasia replied, her voice firm with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Angela and added, "But could you clear the place first? I'd rather fight without an audience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela thought for a second and then nodded. "Sure thing! Everyone, leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd grumbled. They were dying to stay and watch the show, but in the end, they gave in and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A couple of Elders tried to stick around, but under Angela's steely glare, they could only force a smile and follow the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, only Angela, Osborne, and his gang were left near the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said with a grin, "Looks like it's just us now! Ready to start?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of her hand, she poured her power into the Wooden Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, the Golem's energy started to skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once it settled at Ascension Five, Anastasia sized up the Golem calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Five? That's not much of a challenge. How about bumping it up to Ascension Six?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if that's still too easy, I can take on an Ascension Seven one. Now that'd be something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela stared at </span><span>Anastasia,</span><span> eyes wide in disbelief. "You serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded resolutely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Angela's eyes lit up with excitement and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'll make it happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Ascension Seven's a bit much for now. Let's go with Ascension Six first. If you can take down the Ascension Six Wooden Golem, then I'll let you have a go at the Ascension Seven one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia gave the thumbs-up. "Works for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the Wooden Golem's energy flared up again, hitting Ascension Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the fight begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was over in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at Ascension Six, the Golem didn't stand a chance against Anastasia and went down hard under her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Angela watched, her eyes practically glowed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was so hyped that her body was trembling and her fists were clenched tight, but she kept her mouth shut and just waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wooden Golem got back up, and its energy shot through the roof until it hit Ascension Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, standing right in front of them, was an Ascension Seven Wooden Golem, giving off a seriously intimidating vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hitting Ascension Seven meant clearing the third Ascension Stairway trial, which meant a huge power-up way beyond what Ascension Six could offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Anastasia could feel the heat of this challenge, but she didn't back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne giving her a nod of encouragement, she went all out. After a few minutes of a brutal fight, Anastasia finally found an opening, broke through the Golem's defenses, and took down the Ascension Seven Wooden Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight was over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Angela was gasping for air. She stared at Anastasia like she'd just laid eyes on a one-of-a-kind gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Anastasia, aren't you? You're amazing! Seriously, mind-blowing! I </span><span>wanna</span><span> take you under my wing and teach you everything I've picked up over the years. So, what do you say? Wanna be my disciple?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
