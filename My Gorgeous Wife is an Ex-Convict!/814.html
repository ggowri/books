        <h1>Chapter 813</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if this was only a trivial matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, many people could not help guessing in their hearts. 'Who is that woman who just left?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Master Reed would even cripple one of Feng Lai Group's young master's legs for that woman! That would be like declaring war with Feng Lai Group!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Feng Lai Group is only a second-class family business in Emerald City, but... is it worth it to just stand up for a mere woman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Grace had stumbled back into the private room. Perhaps the conflict just now had made her feel as if the alcohol was taking effect more quickly, causing her head to get even dizzier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, what's the matter? You don't look so well," said a colleague.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No&hellip; Nothing." Grace forced out a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, alright. Our welcome party today is almost over, so let's end it here. Let's pay the bill and leave. We should let Grace go back and have a good rest," said Andrea Schwartz. Then, she called the waiter for the bill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their bill came to a total of 73,000 dollars, a bit more than Grace had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace originally thought that everyone would go dutch, but Andrea Schwartz only smiled at her and said, "Grace, everyone came to celebrate you joining our company today. Why don't you pay the bill? You're Jason's girlfriend, so you should be able to afford this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not understand Andrea Schwartz's intentions until now. She was deliberately forcing her to pay the bill so that she could go broke. At the same time, she could find out whether she and Jason were still together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only found it nauseating as she looked at the smile on Andrea Schwartz's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't have that much money," said Grace. Her bank account only had a total of 7,800 dollars, which was all she had left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, are you kidding? Don't be so stingy. Even if you have no money, you can ask Jason to pay for you. He's so rich. He would be willing to foot the bill for you," Andrea Schwartz continued saying with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't have that much money," repeated Grace as her drunken almond-shaped eyes stared at Andrea Schwartz.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz's heart suddenly shuddered. Somehow, she felt fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I afraid of?' Andrea Schwartz muttered in her heart. If this could not even force Grace to pay the bill, Grace and Jason were probably not together anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace said she did not have that much money, several other colleagues immediately became a little unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? Andrea Schwartz, didn't you say Grace would buy us this meal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. Didn't you say her boyfriend is Jason? How can she not even afford a meal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone said to Grace, "Hey, Grace. Don't keep up the appearance if you don't have it. Now, great. You're telling us you don't have the money when it's time to pay the bill."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you. How could Grace be Jason's girlfriend? Her clothes don't look the part. They're years old and she took the bus to work this morning. No expensive cars were picking her up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. Hey, there must be limits to telling lies!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They criticized with everyone chiming in. It was as if it was Grace who told them that Jason was her boyfriend.</p></div>
