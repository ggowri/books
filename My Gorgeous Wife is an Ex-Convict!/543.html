        <h1>Chapter 542</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's mind went back to the news and cases of child abduction she had seen in the past. Suddenly, her brain was even more befuddled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Nelson was really abducted, she would never forgive herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more anxious she was, the more blank her mind became. She wanted to find Nelson quickly, but she did not know where to start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, someone grabbed her arm, and a familiar voice rang in her ear. "Calm down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was these two simple words that made Grace stop feeling so helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What can I do? Nelson is gone!" She choked on her voice, and her eyes were already wet. "It's all my fault. I should have gone to the restroom with Nelson myself. If I accompanied him, he wouldn't have disappeared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's my fault. I asked the staff to go with him, but you can rest assured that we'll find him. I'll seal off the building right now and search for him carefully," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... What if a human trafficker took Nelson away and has already taken him out of the building?" Grace thought of that possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then, I&rsquo;ll shut down the city. I&rsquo;ll shut down the city within ten minutes. You can't get to the exit highway in ten minutes. Once the city is sealed off, even the human traffickers have to stay in the city and can't leave. We'll have plenty of ways to find him," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked. Shut down the city?! Could such a prosperous city be sealed off so simply? However, these words came out of his mouth, and it was hard to believe that he could not do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Believe me, I can find Nelson. Even if I have to turn the whole Emerald City upside down, I'll find him for you." Jason promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would go to such trouble to find a child because he did not want to see her burdened with guilt and sin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that with her character, she would never feel at ease if Nelson was not found!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took out his phone and dialed a number. He was about to explain the matter to the person on the other end of the phone when suddenly, a child's young voice rang. "Aunt..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got a jolt. This was&hellip; Nelson's voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately raised her head only to see Nelson walking over from a short distance away. He was being led by a man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost immediately, Grace rushed forward and hugged Nelson. She choked with sobs as she said, "Where have you been? Why did you walk away all of a sudden? I was afraid I wouldn't find you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she sobbed, she talked a lot. The little one did not know what she was saying, but he could feel her sadness. He kept rubbing his tiny head against her cheek while his tiny hands held her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason saw Nelson, he said into his phone, "It's all right now." Then, he put away his phone and looked away from Grace and Nelson to the man holding Nelson's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing the man clearly, he could not help but slightly raise a brow. There was a flash of amusement in his eyes. What a coincidence, he did not expect to see this man here. It was Martin Weiss, Nelson's biological father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was this some kind of fate?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had finally calmed down. She took a deep breath and looked at the little one in her arms. "Where have you been?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson only stared at Grace's lips as if trying to figure out what she was saying.</p></div>
