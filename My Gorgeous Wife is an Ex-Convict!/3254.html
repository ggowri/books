        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Amber replied. "I'm free this weekend anyway. We haven't gotten together since Valda's housewarming party, so it's a good opportunity to catch up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the weekend, Kyla chose a famous private club called Emerald City and booked a large private room for the party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the private room, there are many entertainment facilities available. However, for this gathering, everyone coincidentally did not bring their children and it is only an adult gathering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few women gathered together, and apart from being concerned about the romantic relationship between Kyla and Martin, the only topic left was about Valda's pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How about it, are you pregnant?" Lina, showing her gossiping nature, asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not yet," Valda shook her head with a hint of regret. Since their marriage, she had been trying to conceive, but it had been several months and she still hadn't gotten pregnant. This made her a little anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Obviously, she doesn't seem to have a body that is prone to pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Has she been checked at the hospital?" Grace asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We did a check-up before marriage at the hospital, and there were no problems," Valda said, then glanced at her friends, "It seems like all of you got pregnant pretty easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turns out that some things may seem easy, but when it comes to oneself, it's not that easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean by easy? I'm definitely not easy," Lina quickly declared, "You have to know that my husband and I tried so many times before we had our Tina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha ha!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina's use of the word "tried" made Valda laugh. She felt that wherever Lina was, the atmosphere would be relaxed. Even her own anxiety was eased by Lina's humor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since both parties have no physical problems, there's no need to rush. Just let nature take its course. Besides, you're only 30 years old, which is not considered old," Kyla said. After all, she was already in her mid-30s when she had her second child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, relax and the child may come naturally," Grace and Amber also said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Lina's next sentence left Valda's brain half-stuck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't always say 'let it be', you also need to cast a wide net for this kind of thing!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A wide net?" Valda was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The more the merrier!" Lina winked, "The higher the frequency, the greater the chance. It's like buying a lottery ticket every day, the chances of winning are higher than buying one once a week."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda understood, then...her face blushed slightly, "Wouldn't that be too tiring?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Brian hears you say that, he'll think you're questioning him," joked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face turned even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, let me teach you some tricks," Lina said, lowering her voice and began to teach Valda her so-called "tricks".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Kyla, who was listening on the side, couldn't help but blush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But speaking of which, if you have so many 'tricks', how come you still had a baby without convincing him?" Kyla asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When I gave birth to my daughter, I was too dangerous and scared Hadwin. No matter what I said, he wouldn't let me have another child!" Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, she expressed regret and actually wanted to have a few more children to make the household livelier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, no matter how much she persisted, her husband refused to agree and even went as far as getting a vasectomy, crushing her hopes and making it impossible for her to even try to get pregnant.</p></div>
