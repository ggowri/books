        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Models make a good living.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He stared at her. "Sister, do you think I make too little money?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ah, no!" she said quickly. "I just want you to have a better life." Perhaps this was all there was to her life, but she wanted something better for him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I will have a better life. When the time comes, I can give you whatever kind of life you want," he told her seriously.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was just a game for him, but at this moment, he really wanted to give her a better life in the future.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">For him, it would take nothing more than a snap of his fingers. If he said it, it&rsquo;d be done.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace laughed. She did not think he could give her the life she wanted. However, she did not want to hurt his feelings, so she said, "Okay, okay, then I'll wait until you earn a lot of money&mdash;and then you can take care of me. That way, I'll be able to live comfortably as someone who knows nothing except for relying on you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He snorted at her sarcasm. &ldquo;Great. Glad we&rsquo;re agreed.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next day, when Terrence went to the break room, he heard some colleagues talking. "Have you seen Mr. Reed's sweater today?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, what's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It seems to be one of Amazon&rsquo;s items."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you sure? How is it possible for Boss Reed to be wearing such mainstream clothes?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't think it's possible either. Could it be some branded clothes that were imitated? &ldquo;Nonetheless, it looks different when it's worn by Mr. Reed. Seems like I should buy it for my husband too."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey, why don't you send me the link for the sweater later?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence's body trembled and he silently exited the coffee room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He did not have the nerve to tell the two colleagues that Mr. Reed's sweater today was really a cheap sale item. He had even seen someone in the company wearing the same one as Mr. Reed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Reed had not said anything, just glanced at the colleague calmly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for that colleague, he looked shocked. It seemed that he could not believe that his big boss was wearing things like him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence returned to the president's office and looked at his superior, who had taken off his suit jacket and was reading some documents in front of his desk.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">With his hair tied back as he normally wore it, the sweater actually made him look more scholarly and less ruthless.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This piece of clothing was most likely bought by Grace . Normally, before Mr. ReedMr. Reed got to the company, he would change out from the clothes he had been wearing at the apartment. those clothes were dry-cleaned and prepared for him so he could change back into them when he left for the day. Today, however, he had not taken off his sweater.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What does this mean?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Also, how much longer would Mr. Reed continue going back and forth to this woman&rsquo;s home?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, naturally, Terrence did not dare to ask these questions.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, this is the purchase proposal you wanted." Terrence set the file he was holding on the desk. When he was about to leave, he suddenly stopped.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you know that Sean has commissioned a publicity campaign with engagement photos throughout the city?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence was flustered. He had never thought his superior would suddenly ask such a question.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Yes, sir. I know. I&rsquo;ve seen them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How many of those ads are running in the city?" Jason asked.</p></div>
