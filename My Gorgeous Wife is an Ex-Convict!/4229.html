        <h1>Chapter 4227 She Used to Love Him So Much</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I really did love him that much," Tina lowered her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But your feelings for Kit were just idolatry," Eugenia quickly added, "the person you love is Chandler. You've always kept these two feelings separate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina paused for a moment, "Then how much do I love Chandler?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia thought for a moment, "You said you wanted to get pregnant and have Chandler's child as soon as possible. And you also said that if the person you married wasn't Chandler, you probably wouldn't want to get married at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't help but start thinking. Did she really say those things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, is this child she's carrying now the one she hopes to have with Chandler?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia continued talking, recalling all the ways Tina showed her love for Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Tina listened, she couldn't shake off the feeling that it all seemed unreal, as if she was listening to someone else's story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, you wanted to marry Chandler early on and even thought about how you two would make love," Eugenia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina choked on her saliva and finally caught her breath. "Did I really do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you did. So now you know how much you love Chandler," Eugenia said. "Speaking of which, Chandler has been really good to you. He always thought you were eight years younger, so he didn't want to rush into having sex with you. He's really honest. If you hadn't made the first move, you probably wouldn't have a child together now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina bit her lip lightly, "He's really good to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's so good that all the girls in school envy you!" Eugenia said. "You know, he's a big CEO, rich, handsome, and in great shape. He could have any girl he wants, but he's only focused on you. He has no scandals. I heard that there were women who tried to seduce him in the past, but his bodyguards threw them out of the room!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia continued telling Tina everything she knew about Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina listened quietly as if learning about a different Chandler from the one she knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chandler Eugenia described was gentle, mature, and completely devoted to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would do whatever it takes to fulfill her wishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when Chandler said he loved her at the hospital, it must have been true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, after you went missing, Chandler seemed like he was going crazy. I've never seen him like that before. He was like a madman. No one dared to say anything bad about you in front of him. I even felt like if you couldn't be found, he would die too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia really felt that way. If Tina died, Chandler would die with her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned and suddenly raised her hand to cover her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Eugenia's words, her heart suddenly ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, what's wrong with you?" Eugenia worriedly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Tina sighed in relief. "Did Chandler really go crazy when I was missing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No doubt about it. I was trembling just being around him at that time," Eugenia said. "Anyway, now that you've lost your memory, Chandler is probably the one suffering the most. Tina, Chandler is really a good man. You two were truly in love before. I hope you can recover your memories soon."</span></p></div>
