        <h1>Chapter 2280</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, when Jacqueline Bowman asked him to pass the message, she had said quite confidently, "As long as you pass this message to Kyla, I have a way to get myself acquitted once she comes to see me. When others see that I'm acquitted, they won't think that you've offended the Weiss family. You can go on living as before!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Neal Reid doubted Jacqueline Bowman's words. She committed such a great crime this time. Could she be acquitted?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Weiss, you... you'll meet Jacqueline Bowman, won't you?" Neal Reid was expecting Kyla to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as Jacqueline Bowman was acquitted, his business would not be affected any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Wu, it's up to me whether I want to see her or not. You can leave now," Kyla asked him to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Neal Reid wanted to say something more, but Martin Weiss's cold gaze silenced him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he continued speaking and upset Martin Weiss, the Hunter family would probably collapse faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid could only leave reluctantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said to Kyla, "Don't go. You don't have to see Jacqueline Bowman again. I'll put my lawyers in charge of this case. Take care of the baby, and don't worry about these things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla replied in acknowledgment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to see Jacqueline Bowman, but she could imagine how much Jacqueline Bowman wanted to see her. Perhaps she wanted to use her to get away from her crime or something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will I regret... not going? What could be important between Jacqueline Bowman and me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps Jacqueline Bowman wished to use the matter of her helping Kyla in prison as leverage again? However, Kyla no longer wanted to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Martin had not rescued her, she would probably have met a miserable end. She would have even lost the baby in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police told her that Mr. Lambert confessed that Jacqueline Bowman suggested having the two young men rape her and kill her baby. Mr. Lambert just wanted to use the kidnapping incident to claim credit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt her heart sinking coldly when the police told her that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that Jacqueline Bowman had such malicious intentions when she was smiling and showing great concern for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, why don't you go back to your ward and rest? The doctor said you need to get plenty of rest," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss got up but did not return to the ward. Instead, he spread his arms to hug Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened, and she could hear his hoarse voice saying, "You can push me away if you don't want me to hug you like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip and pressed her hands on his chest, but she did not push him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that his body was still bandaged under the hospital gown. He got injured after beating himself with a wooden stick to save her.</p></div>
