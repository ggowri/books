        <h1>Chapter 541</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There would never be a shortage of beautiful women in the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even some women who thought they looked good were now trying hard to strike a pose so that they could maybe get Jason's attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason never once took his eyes off Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Howell Webb took a few more photos with Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Nelson said to Grace, "Pee... Pee..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace understood that the little one wanted to go to the restroom, but there were no separate restrooms. The toilets were at the end of the corridor on each floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to go with Nelson herself, but Jason said, "You can't go to the restroom either. Let the staff here go with Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said and instructed a male staff member nearby to accompany Nelson to the restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace expressed this to the little one in sign language while talking to him at the same time. She asked Nelson to do as the staff said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one nodded his head to show that he would be obedient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people noticed Nelson's strange appearance because the two were making some gestures. Some also saw the cochlear implant on Nelson's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had slightly decorated the cochlear implant so that those who did not know would at first think that the child was wearing a small cartoon ornament.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, the few actresses who failed to attract Jason's attention gave Grace another pitiful look. Even if she gave birth to Young Master Reed's child out of wedlock, a disabled child was destined to have nothing to do with the Reed family's fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff took Nelson to the restroom, but not long after, he hurried back alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where's Nelson?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm sorry, Miss Cummins. I don't know where that kid went. I took him to the restroom, and on our way back, I got a phone call. I took out my phone to answer it. I only took at most a few seconds, but the child disappeared. I don't know where he went!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff looked distraught. After all, he heard that this child was probably Young Master Reed's illegitimate son. If he lost the child, would he still have a life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?!" Grace got a shock and dropped her autograph board to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hurried forward and grabbed the staff. "Nelson's gone? On your way back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes&hellip; Yes, just in the corridor," replied the staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next second, Grace had stormed out of the room and into the corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason followed suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked down the corridor. She shouted, "Nelson, Nelson!" However, no one answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was not very good at speaking yet. Even if he did hear her voice, he would not be able to answer her out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Where would Nelson go? Was he&hellip; Taken away?</p></div>
