        <h1>Chapter 3918</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned, but Clarissa sneered, "Nancy, have you ever thought about who is paying for your mother's medical expenses while she's lying in the hospital? If it weren't for the Schultz family paying for it, your mother would have been kicked out of the hospital by now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa!" Nancy stared at the person in front of her. "My mother fell down and has been in a coma until now. Have you ever felt guilty?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other party laughed as if she had heard a funny joke, "Why should I feel guilty? Your mother fell down by herself. Your words are really funny. Do you think your mother became a vegetable and you're afraid you won't get any benefits from the Schultz family in the future, so you want to slander me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy understood that this woman in front of her had no guilt at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when her mother became a vegetable, Clarissa was still happy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Francis...his previous words were enough to show that his affection for my mother was pitifully small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you can go now. If there's nothing else, don't come here again. I will continue to pay for your mother's medical expenses out of the obligation of being a husband, but I will dissolve the marriage with your mother. In the future, you will have no relationship with the Schultz family!" Francis said mercilessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt a sense of desolation in her heart. She had once hoped that she had no relationship with the Schultz family, but she didn't expect it to be realized in this way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Nancy returned to the hospital, she suddenly saw doctors and nurses going in and out of her mother's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on? What happened to my mom?" Nancy asked anxiously as the nurse stopped her outside the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The patient's condition suddenly deteriorated, and the doctor is performing emergency rescue!" the nurse replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had thought that being in a vegetative state was the worst condition her mother could be in, but she never imagined that there could be something worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After an hour of rescue efforts, the doctor declared her mother dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stared blankly at her mother lying on the hospital bed, with no heartbeat or breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could this be possible! How could it happen so fast?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if her mother was in a vegetative state, even if she was unconscious, at least she still had a thought, a hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy could imagine her mother waking up in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had so much to say to her mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Doctor, please save my mother, maybe there's still a chance?!" she shouted desperately, pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the doctor just looked at her sympathetically and said, "We've done everything we can, I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, she just sat by her mother's bedside, quietly watching her dead mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why...why did it have to be her mother who died?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she hadn't had a conflict with Clarissa at that time; if her mother hadn't come to help her; if Clarissa hadn't pushed her mother...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then her mother wouldn't have died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But all these "ifs" are too late to say now!</p></div>
