        <h1>Chapter 1153</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I feel a lot better now..." The waitress was so excited that she stammered a little, and her cheeks blushed due to her feeling shy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Since this man was going to pull out your nails, pull out all ten of his nails now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed, if it hadn't been for your timely arrival, my fingernails would&rsquo;ve been pulled out. But... I think he knows he was wrong too... Master Reed, why don't you let him off the hook this time?" The woman spoke with a delicate look, looking kind and innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such a woman could easily arouse a man's affection and desire to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace trembled when she heard their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly felt like a joke. The man kneeling on the ground was a perpetrator, and the woman with an injured finger, dressed as a waitress, was the victim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was Jason... getting justice for the woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a trance, she looked at Jason who was interacting with the waitress. From her point of view, what she saw now was his profile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had clear deep outlines and a straight nose bridge. His thin lips parted and closed as he said something to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Something he had once said to her flashed through her mind... "I'll get you justice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, he had reversed her case and helped her get justice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he was getting justice for another woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gently lowered her eyes and told herself that all this had nothing to do with her anymore. What she had to do now was to leave quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another man burst into the private room and ran straight toward Grace. "Grace, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace came back to her senses and saw Brian standing in front of her, panting slightly. He had apparently rushed over in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... fine, but what are you doing here?" Grace asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll talk about that later," said Brian as his gaze fell on Jason's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was also looking at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men looked at each other, but Brian's eyes were aggressive. It was as if he would do whatever it took to strike back if Jason were to do anything to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes were cold, making people unable to fathom what he was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Patrick hurried forward and said, "It's a misunderstanding. It's a complete misunderstanding. I was the one who brought Grace here today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you bring her here?" Brian's phoenix eyes glanced at Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was stunned. He could not tell him that he was afraid Jason was triggered by the video of them on the bus and that Jason might kill someone at his place, so he brought Grace here to &lsquo;explain&rsquo;, could he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... things seemed to have turned out a little differently than he expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Patrick could only continue his awkward smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't drag Grace into this kind of thing anymore. Don't blame me for not treating you as a friend if you do something stupid like this again!" warned Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick immediately grimaced. He was unlucky today. Both Jason and Brian warned him one after another.</p></div>
