        <h1>Chapter 4260 Entering her room</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving her daughter's room, Lina's face was filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>S</span><span>he was willing to support her daughter's decision</span><span>. Meanwhile, she knew</span><span> </span><span>it </span><span>wouldn&rsquo;t be easy for Tina to get </span><span>a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Hunter family saved her and Tina's lives and established this marriage contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Chandler was devoted to Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she didn't know why her daughter suddenly made this decision, as a mother, she could sense that her daughter had made </span><span>up her mind</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Tina?" Hadwin approached and asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina sighed, "Tina wants a divorce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divorce?" Hadwin furrowed his brows unconsciously. "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina sighed bitterly. "Tina </span><span>didn&rsquo;t tell me,</span><span> and I don't want to push her. But the truth is, she has lost her memory now and has forgotten what happened between her and Chandler before. Being bound to Chandler in marriage like this is a kind of confinement for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she really wants a divorce, then let her have it," Hadwin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before their daughter lost her memory, he had made up his mind that if she didn't want the engagement with the Hunter family, he would help her break off the engagement at any cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was just a matter of doing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina had already known that her husband would respond like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's talk to the Hunter family</span><span> someday</span><span>," Lina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of the circumstances, it was Tina who requested the divorce. If Chandler hadn't done anything wrong, then it was a price that the Stephenson family would have to pay in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could go and find the Hunter family, Chandler had already appeared at the Stephenson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see Tina," Chandler spoke up directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, what really happened between you and Tina?" Lina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler remained silent, his expression a mix of awkwardness, bitterness, and unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him like this, Lina couldn't bear to continue asking, so she said, "Tina is in her room, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!" Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler had been to Tina's room many times before, but this was the first time he stood nervously at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he felt like a criminal facing judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Chandler finally knocked on the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in!" Tina's voice came from inside the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler pushed the door open and saw Tina with her back turned to him, seemingly arranging something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached, he realized that she was organizing the photo albums that contained pictures of them together, as well as some things related to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She</span><span> used to be kept</span><span> them</span><span> in her room. But now, she had put all of them into a big box. It was like she wanted to seal everything away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of unease grew stronger</span><span> in his heart</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina..." Chandler's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina, who had been organizing her things, suddenly froze. Then she turned to look at Chandler, her eyes filled with undisguised surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought it was her parents who came in, but she didn't expect it to be Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to see you." He had always been composed and calm, but now, he felt a sense of helplessness</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>He was </span><span>even hesitant to meet her gaze.</span></p></div>
