        <h1>Chapter 1778</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He raised his hand and gently touched his daughter's head with a smile on his face. "Of course, I won't chop off his hand. I'm not a bad person. I just want you to know that even if you're handcuffed together, it's actually easy to separate you if we want to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper blinked. "Daddy, are you really not going to chop off William's hand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes." Jason looked just like a loving father. His eyes were full of affection when he looked at his daughter, who looked very much like Grace. When he looked at his tiny daughter, it made up for his regrets for not knowing Grace when they were younger. "But Jasper, just tell me if you like William. You don't have to play such tricks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Daddy, will you let William stay if I tell you that?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll agree if it's a reasonable request," Jason said gently. The smile on the corner of his lips softened. "You're my daughter, and I'll only give you the best. You can keep William around if you really like him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said nonchalantly. Jasper instantly smiled and leaned over to kiss Jason hard on his face. "Daddy, you're so nice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I hope I can grant all your wishes." Jason touched his daughter's little head fondly before saying, "Alright, it's late. Hurry and go to sleep. I'll accompany you and tell you a story."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," answered Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason picked up the storybook Jasper was holding earlier and began to tell a story. Soon, Jasper fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at his daughter's sleeping face with a gentle gaze. However, when he glanced at William, who was sleeping beside his daughter, his eyes became extremely cold. There was no tenderness left in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Standing up, Jason turned to leave the room after turning off the lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The bedroom was instantly dark, and only the moonlight from the window offered some light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">William, who had his eyes closed, opened them. His little face was pale, and his body was stiff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was awake from just now. He even thought what Jasper's father said was not meant for Jasper to hear but him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He remembered seeing the uncle on TV, and his mother had pointed at him while saying, "William, his name is Jason. He&rsquo;s the most terrible man in Emerald City. He's also the strongest executioner. He&rsquo;ll not spare anyone he wants to lay a hand on. He's just like a demon..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His mother's face had contorted when she said this. There was fear, which was a feeling he understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had only seen the devil in TV dramas and movies. The devil would tear people apart with a mouth full of blood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jason... Is Jasper's daddy the devil?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If Jasper hadn&rsquo;t said she likes me, would he really chop my hand off?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">William had always been a calm child, but... he was only five years old, after all. He could not help feeling scared, and his body would not stop trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when he looked down at his hands, all that crossed his mind was... 'If I lose my hand, does that mean I won't be able to play the piano anymore?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could not say he liked playing the piano. His talent was natural. His teacher said he was a genius, but he lacked emotion and was more like a machine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He never thought about what it would be like to be unable to play the piano, but he was suddenly a little reluctant.</p></div>
