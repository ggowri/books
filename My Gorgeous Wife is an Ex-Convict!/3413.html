        <h1>Chapter 3411</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could finish her sentence, his hand suddenly lifted and pressed directly on her shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" She couldn't help but cry out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't move!" he said, and then his hand quickly pulled open the clothes on her shoulder. Suddenly, a red bruise on her skin appeared in his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened to your shoulder?" Mason asked, his handsome face showing a hint of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just someone accidentally hit me with a ball while playing soccer, and they apologized. I went to the school clinic and it didn't hurt my bones, just a bruise," Veronica explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From childhood, whenever she got hurt, he would always pull apart her clothes to see where she was injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was a child, she didn't really think much of it. But as she grew up and her body started to develop, this kind of thing became particularly embarrassing for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, Mason, you can let go now and let me pull up my shirt," said Veronica. Even though only a small part of her shoulder was exposed, it made her feel embarrassed and flushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't let go of her hand. His dark eyes fixed on the swollen spot as he asked, "Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, as long as I apply some medicine later, it will be fine," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the next moment, her body suddenly stiffened because he had lowered his head and lightly licked the injured area with his tongue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason!" Veronica almost jumped up, ignoring the pain, and suddenly broke free from his hand. Her face was red as she stared at him and said, "How could you do this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there anything wrong?" he asked calmly, as if what he had just done was completely normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You...you can't do this!" she said with a red face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But in the past, wasn't it always like this? You told me that if I licked it, it wouldn't hurt as much," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was speechless. But that was when they were kids. Back then, they were all very young, just in the first or second grade of elementary school. But now, they are all high school students.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That...afterwards, you can't make such moves towards me again," Veronica said as she pulled up her shirt to cover her shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He approached her, casting a shadow over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she is two years older than him, in this past year, he has grown like a weed and shot up in height. Now, even though he is only 14 years old, he is already over 170cm tall, which is a full 10cm taller than her 160cm height. As a result, his approach also gives her a sense of pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why can't I?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because... we have all grown up now," she said. "There are differences between boys and girls. I am a girl and you are a boy, so you cannot pull my clothes like this in the future, and you definitely cannot lick my wounds."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His beautiful eyes were fixed on her as he said, "But for me, there has never been any difference between men and women. To me, you are like an elder sister, regardless of whether you are a man or a woman. You are the most important person to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip slightly and said, "Since...since you think I'm the most important person to you, then you should respect me. In any case, you can't do this again in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His thin lips were tightly pressed together, and he didn't say a word. He just kept staring at her with those beautiful eyes.</p></div>
