        <h1>Chapter 244</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, Sabrina. Don't say it like that!" someone said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just telling the truth." Sabrina Briggs snorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s a fact she just got off a BMW," another one said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Perhaps she was sent by some big boss behind her. Some people don't have many skills, but they know how to stand out and get close to the bosses," Sabrina Briggs said with a sour tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the previous filming, she had thought that Grace was out of luck and was being bullied by the second female lead. Who knew that the crown prince himself would carry Grace to the lounge moments after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This made her very envious. She had been dreaming of opportunities like this. Sabrina Briggs even regretted it several times afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had known better, she would have done it herself when Evelyn instructed Grace to kneel and grovel. Although Grace looked terrible at the time, it was worth it to get Brian's attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sabrina Briggs even thought that the luxury car just now belonged to Brian, and it was the entertainment industry&rsquo;s crown prince himself who ordered someone to send Grace over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Sabrina Briggs said this, a lot of the extras were looking at Grace strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not bother to say anything as it would only make things worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she was not familiar with these people. It was their freedom to think whatever. She did not have to prove herself innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not long after the crowd gathered that the organizer, Sidney, took them to the film set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did what she did last time. She changed into her costume, put on her makeup, and waited for the filming to start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this time, as she prepared to shoot, she saw Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, instead of using a stand-in like she had done the last time, Lily stood next to the male lead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace looked at Lily, Lily was also looking at Grace. Her eyes, however... Instead of the usual condescending look, they looked more inquisitive. It was like Lily was watching her and thinking about something. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That gave Grace a strange feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the accident happened, she remembered how Lily hated her so much that if she could just tear her up, she would. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought Lily would attack her after she got out of prison, but other than that garbage ring picking incident, Lily had not confronted her much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because she was already in such a miserable state that Lily simply did not bother to deal with her? Or... was it because of Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the Stevens family knew about her relationship with Jason, would Lily not know?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Grace was thinking, Evelyn, who was standing beside the male lead, looked at Grace unkindly. She managed to persuade the director to bring in the previous crew of extras to get Grace back here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was supposed to be shot last week, but after what happened that day, she did not show up for three days in a row. Of course, the filming of the scene was delayed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she was Brian's girlfriend, no one dared to say anything to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, she was not going to let Grace get away with it. She wanted to let Grace know that she, Evelyn, was Brian's girlfriend.</p></div>
