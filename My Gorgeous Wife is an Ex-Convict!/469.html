        <h1>Chapter 468</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, Harold still seemed humble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's not necessary. I don't think she wants to see you," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily and Camelia Meyer looked relieved. It was better for them not to apologize in person. At least they could feel less humiliated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was hard for them to apologize to the person they used to perceive as an ant, especially when that person was their daughter&rsquo;s murderer. To Lily, she was once her rival in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Harold did not breathe a sigh of relief. Instead, his brows furrowed even more. A sense of foreboding ran through his heart. He was afraid that this was not as easy as he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In that case, we won't bother you, Jason. Goodbye." Camelia Meyer beckoned Harold with her eyes to leave quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer had only gotten up when Jason's voice rang, "By the way, you should pay what you owe before you go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do we owe?" Camelia Meyer looked puzzled, wondering what Jason was referring to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You slapped Grace a few times today. You can pay your debt by slapping yourself," said Jason matter-of-factly. However, Camelia Meyer only felt a surge of anger in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she supposed to slap herself? Just because she slapped Grace earlier?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do I owe? That woman deserves those slaps! She got a bargain with those slaps!" Camelia Meyer blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face suddenly darkened. He stood up, walked up to Camelia Meyer, and slapped her so hard that she stumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one had expected Jason to do that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer was stunned. She used her hand to cover her cheek that was hit while looking dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked down at Camelia Meyer coldly. "Do you have the right to hit her? The Atkinson family is not in any position to touch her. If you dare to touch her again, don't blame me for not sparing you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At his serious words, even Harold and Lily were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold and Lily wanted to say more, but Jason had already given them the boot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold sighed and left with his wife and daughter. Who knew if they would annoy him more if they stayed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that all, Dad?" Lily asked hurriedly once they were out of Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold shook his head with a ghastly expression. "I'm afraid it's not that easy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's sudden action just now surprised Harold. Men like Jason usually would not do it themselves if they had to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason got his hands dirty, which meant that he was really angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold could not imagine how far Jason would go when he got angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer had not come back to her senses. She said with an angry face, "How... How dare a young man like him slap me? Did he forget about Jennifer? Who does Grace think she is? That woman has been to prison! He even wants someone who has been to prison. He's really bringing honor to the Reed family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of the slap she had just received, Camelia Meyer felt extremely embarrassed.</p></div>
