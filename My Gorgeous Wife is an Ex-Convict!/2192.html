        <h1>Chapter 2190</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"This is my favorite box of chocolates and an apology card I wrote. William, we&rsquo;re still best friends, right?" Jasper said with a deep nasal voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked at the chocolates and apology card in his hand. He suddenly felt a little heavy-hearted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he opened the apology card, he saw a lot of words written on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew that she hated writing the most. She would get lazy every time the kindergarten teachers and tutors taught her to write. aunt Cummins said she even wrote her own name hideously because she did not like writing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she had written all the ugly words on the apology card one by one. There were so many words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing William being silent, Jasper said a little guiltily, "Is... my handwriting too ugly? I... I tried very hard. Keep this apology card first. I promise I'll work on my writing and make it look good!" She was only six years old, anyway. She would be able to write beautiful words when she grew up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, another voice rang out as it got closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll walk myself. Put me down..." Someone carried Mick Reed inside. He was shouting and struggling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he was small and no match for an adult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Security took Mick Reed to the living room, along with the tools he used to &lsquo;commit the crime&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Mick Reed saw the people in the living room, he stopped struggling and immediately calmed down as if he had backup now. He had his father to take care of everything, anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow frowned as he looked at the tools. The &lsquo;tools&rsquo; looked a little crude to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the boy in front of him was able to cut off the Barlow family house's electricity twice and hacked the security system with these things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It seems that you have a capable son, Young master Reed," Philip Barlow said with a fake smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, no. My son only wanted to help his sister see William. I hope you won't take it to heart, Mr. Barlow," Jason also responded with a fake smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow's face trembled. 'Don't take it to heart...' He wanted to. However, the Barlow family would be the only one humiliated if he did. Two kids had caused the Barlow family of Deer City so much trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed walked up to William and said solemnly, "I misunderstood you, and I'm sorry. I'll help you if someone ever bullies you in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed spoke so solemnly. That was extremely rare for him. After all, he usually only cared about his family. He never cared about people outside his family, let alone help others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William froze too. Although he saw Mick Reed every day and went to the same kindergarten, they rarely talked to each other. Even if they did, it was all about Jasper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Mick Reed had now apologized to him and made a promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing that his son and daughter had apologized, Jason said, "Alright, you've said everything you came here to say. It's time to go back to the hotel. We have to take a plane back to Emerald City tomorrow morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper subconsciously grabbed William to leave with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, William's feet froze in place.</p></div>
