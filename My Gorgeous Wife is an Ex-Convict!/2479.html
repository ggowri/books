        <h1>Chapter 2477</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can I drop by somewhere first before I go to the accommodation you&rsquo;ve arranged for me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze. "Where do you want to go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"the Moss family&rsquo;s residence," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her remaining nine fingers clasped together. She looked nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace accompanied Amber Mitchell to the Moss family&rsquo;s house, she was surprised to see Brian in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately froze, while a trace of warmth appeared on Brian's usually indifferent face upon seeing Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Moss, Whitney Herrera, sighed to herself when she saw this. It seemed that what she heard was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was said that the crown prince had many girlfriends, but only Grace, who had become the mistress of the Reed family, had managed to win him over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some even said that Jason and Brian had a falling out. They almost fought because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It made Whitney Herrera even more surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Jason and Brian were important people and had seen all sorts of beautiful women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked pretty, gentle, and graceful, but she was not exactly stunning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, such a woman had two outstanding men who loved her, so she must have special charms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss wanted to refuse to meet Amber Mitchell. Even though she had kowtowed a hundred times to offer incense to his eldest brother, Daley Moss still thought of her as his brother&rsquo;s murderer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his wife had given him a look when the servants announced their arrival. They had been married for years, so he understood what she meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he did not want to see Amber Mitchell, he still had to show Grace some respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because Grace had the Reed family and... the Hart family as her supporters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially now that his wife was planning to make a comeback, he had to meet them if they wanted to be on the crown prince's good side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss still seemed upset when he saw Amber Mitchell. "Amber Mitchell, do you think you didn&rsquo;t cause enough trouble at the Moss family's cemetery that night? Do you want to make a scene here too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not here to make a scene. I only want to talk to you about something," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"the Moss family has nothing to talk to you about," Daley Moss said without mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if that car accident wasn't an accident?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's expression instantly changed as soon as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It wasn&rsquo;t an accident?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it wasn&rsquo;t an accident. Herman was driving, and he should have been able to avoid the truck at the speed he was driving. But he failed to avoid it when he stepped on the brakes. The brake pedal wasn&rsquo;t completely dysfunctional, but it wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to stop the car," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's face grew solemn. "Do you mean someone tampered with the brakes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's my speculation, but I have no evidence. I went to the police to look at their investigation report after leaving the hospital. The police did check the vehicle, but there's no indication of a brake problem on the report."</p></div>
