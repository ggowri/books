        <h1>Chapter 924</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uncle!" Nelson cried out with some surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stepped forward and rubbed the little one's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn came over after hearing the noise. When she saw Martin Weiss, her face paled and she wanted to rush forward to grab her grandson. However, she could not help shaking after Martin Weiss glanced at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, this man had done too much damage to the Corbyn family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her daughter was detained, she went to beg him not to appear in court and not to testify against Yun, but her efforts were to no avail. The man had just looked at her coldly and said, "This is what the Corbyn family owes the Weiss family, and what she owes Paisley! Only a few years in prison is too much of a bargain for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla knew that her mother was afraid, so she leaped forward and grabbed Mrs. Corbyn's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn calmed down a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, let's go out and talk," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only smiled faintly. "I'm not here for you today." As he spoke, he squatted down and looked at the little one in front of him. "Your last name isn't Carbyn. It's Ye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla immediately stiffened when he said that. She suddenly understood what he was here for!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No! Don't! Don't go on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Nelson finds out&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to rush over. She wanted to remove her son's hearing aid. She wanted to prevent him from hearing what Martin Weiss would say next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was one step too late. Martin Weiss's voice continued to ring in the small room. "Nelson, I'm your father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, you're not!" said Kyla as she rushed to her son's side and glared at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla would have pulled Nelson behind her if Martin Weiss had not put a hand on Nelson's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want me to throw the DNA report right in front of you so you can admit it?" Martin Weiss asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla wobbled a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson looked at Martin Weiss in confusion and turned to Kyla. "Mommy, isn't Daddy up in the sky? Why would he say he's my daddy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's mouth was full of bitterness. 'What do I do? What should I tell Nelson? His father never even expected him to exist.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He almost could not have been born because of what his father had said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ll take you back to the Weiss family and let you acknowledge your biological family. You don't have to live in such a small room anymore, and I can get you any kind of toys. No one will laugh at you anymore!" said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss could imagine what kind of taunts a deaf child might usually encounter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if his son was disabled, he would not let anyone ridicule him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one's eyes lit up as he heard this. Though he did not quite understand some of the words, he did understand the rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really my daddy?" asked the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Martin Weiss gave a positive answer.</p></div>
