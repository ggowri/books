        <h1>Chapter 2572</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow said, "No, come back first. Someone will take him back to the Gregory family&rsquo;s house when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call, Philip Barlow looked at his son. "William, don't misunderstand Jasper if you want to be with her in the future. When she's in trouble, don't just stand by and watch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't stand by and watch. I'll do my best to help Jasper if she's ever in trouble!" the little one said earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow smiled. "That's great!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just hoped his son would remember what he said today no matter what happened in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell did not expect George Gregory to come to her door drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, it's late. I'm going to bed!" Amber Mitchell said coldly, trying to close the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hand was on the door, preventing her from closing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't... Don't close the door. I... I just... came to see you... I... I'd like to have a word with you. Don't... Don't worry. I won't do anything else. I won't... I won't hurt you anymore..." he stammered. He reeked of alcohol and was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell frowned. 'How much did he drink?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said, "But I don't want to see you, and I don&rsquo;t have anything to say to you! George Gregory, if you want to get into a drunken fit, don't do it here. If you really don't want to hurt me, don't ever show up in front of me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words were like a slap in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body swayed. "Can... Can you give me another punishment? Don't do this. I... can't do it. I can't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't? She sneered suddenly. "Why can't you do it? Mr. Gregory, you never came to see me when I was in the hospital for so many years!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was speechless and began to tremble as if he had been struck with the sharpest sword.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amby... I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry..." he whispered. It was the most painful sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no amount of apology was of use. "I told you to stop calling me Amby. You shouldn't be the one to call me that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please forgive me, will you? I know how wrong I was. I know I&rsquo;ve hurt you too much. I'll make up for all that you've suffered, okay?" He sobbed after losing control of his emotions. He hugged her as if he were holding his most precious treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, let go of me!" Amber Mitchell struggled hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he held her tight. "I'll make it up to you. I can make it up to you. I'll make it up to you as long as you say so! Amby, I love you. I really love you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Love? George Gregory, who are you to talk about love? If this is the way you love someone, I would rather you never loved me! Do you know how disgusting it is to be held by someone you hate?" Amber Mitchell shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body stiffened, and she took the opportunity to push him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was slapped hard across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make it up? How are you going to make it up to me? Can you prevent me from ever being tortured in the mental hospital? Or can you return me my missing finger?&rdquo; Amber Mitchell said as she raised her right hand in front of George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her right ring finger was missing.</p></div>
