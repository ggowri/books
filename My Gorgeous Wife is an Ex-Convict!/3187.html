        <h1>Chapter 3185</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Lexi with a stern face, "I hope you know your place when you speak. Your words just now could be considered defamation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't defame you, I spoke the truth! Otherwise, why don't you give me a reason? Does my cousin, who has seen all kinds of beauties, really need to marry a woman like you who has a lame leg and is ugly?" Lexi vented all the anger she had been holding in these past few days onto Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During these days, people at school have been discussing this lame girl, and many of them even envy her, which made her very angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you judge someone's eligibility for love based solely on their appearance and physical health, then you are underestimating Brian and showing your own shallowness!" Valda finished speaking and left the restroom without bothering to pay attention to Lexi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi stared at Valda's back and heard her classmates saying, "Lexi, what if she tells your cousin what you just said?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right, if your cousin helps her instead of helping you, his cousin, wouldn't you be at a big loss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did she come here to eat today? Is she here with your cousin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several classmates were discussing with each other when Lexi suddenly shuddered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this woman really goes to her cousin to complain, won't she be in even more trouble?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this thought, she immediately hurried out of the restroom with quick steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda naturally walks slowly, while Lexi hurried over and caught up with her in no time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, are you planning to go to Brian's place to complain?" Lexi blocked Valda's path and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at her coldly and said, "If I want to talk to Brian about something, it's my freedom. Since you dare to speak up, why be afraid of me talking to Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You really are a petty person, only capable of making complaints behind others' backs? Just because your leg is injured, does that mean you can't handle criticism?" Lexi said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's gaze grew colder as she spoke, "You keep saying that I have a lame leg and leave me no face, but do you know that the more you do this, the more others will look down on you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To outsiders, Lexi is considered a relative of the Hart family and should have been united with them. However, her actions have only made her a laughing stock in the eyes of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Looking down on you is one thing, but why do they have to look down on me? Let me ask you, did you say a lot of bad things about me to Brian and my aunt and uncle, which is why they still refuse to let me go to the Hart family?" Lexi asked fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During this period, her parents visited the Hart family several times, but every time they brought up the topic of lifting the ban on her visiting the Hart family, they were refused by her aunt and uncle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made Lexi hate Valda even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said calmly, "Instead of maliciously speculating about others over there, it's better to think about why things have turned out this way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda spoke and turned to leave, but Lexi stopped her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You caused this whole thing, are you just going to walk away from it? You have to fix it. You need to tell Brian, Aunt and Uncle that this is all your fault. I didn't do anything wrong, why am I the one who can't be a part of the Hart family?" Lexi confidently stated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was almost amused by Lexi's behavior. Lexi was clearly in the wrong, yet she tried to appear as if she had a valid point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda didn't want to argue with Lexi anymore, so she took out her phone and dialed Brian's number directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing? Who are you calling?" Lexi asked nervously.</p></div>
