        <h1>Chapter 1174</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney looked at each other. After many years of marriage, they could understand each other's thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney cleared his throat and finally took a step back, saying, "If you can resolve all the conflicts in the Stephenson family, then we'll give your marriage our blessings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, parents always wanted their children to be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was delighted. 'Have my parents relented?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was also relieved. After all, they were Lina's parents and the most important people to Lina. He also hoped they would give their blessings to his and Lina&rsquo;s marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned around and looked at the smile on Lina's face. He secretly made up his mind that he must put an end to the Stephenson family's affairs as soon as possible to give Lina a better and safer future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace visited Nelson first when she came to the hospital to see Brian. Nelson was in good condition and should be able to discharge in two days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Coincidentally, Nelson and Brian were hospitalized at the same hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Nelson was in the regular children's ward while Brian was in the VIP ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was happy to see Grace. Grace had bought some fruits for Nelson, so she cut some dragon fruit and fed the pieces to the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Nelson had eaten enough, Grace wiped the little one's mouth and hands. Then, she took out a new storybook she had bought for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one was only four years old, but he already knew a lot of words. He could even read certain storybooks by himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Nelson read, Grace asked Kyla Corbyn in a whisper, "Kyla, what's the matter? You don't look so good." She noticed that Kyla's mind had been wandering since she entered the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing," Kyla Corbyn said with a slightly awkward expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you have any difficulties, tell me. Even though I may not be able to help much, I can always help a little," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've helped me a lot already," said Kyla Corbyn, but the custody case was like a boulder pressing on her heart, making her breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was willing to represent her for free, but... she had been hesitating whether she wanted to go ahead with the lawsuit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had little chance of winning the lawsuit, and once it started, she would have to worry about how much it would hurt Nelson if the media published her time in prison all over the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was about to leave, she met Chase Harper who had also come to see Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He-Hello!" greeted Chase Harper. "I found some time to visit Nelson once I learned about his hospitalization," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he got to know Nelson through Grace, they kept in touch because he liked Nelson. Sometimes, he would call Kyla Corbyn's phone number and talk to Nelson, and sometimes, he would visit the little one with some toys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had wanted to visit the little one when he heard that he was hospitalized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How... have you been?" Chase Harper asked shyly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm okay," Grace said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." Chase Harper hesitated for a moment before finally saying, "As long as you're okay."</p></div>
