        <h1>Chapter 2250</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was still in his office. When she saw Martin Weiss, she summoned up courage and went forward. "Mr. Weiss, I think you&rsquo;ve misunderstood me. I came here with the best of intentions. I meant no harm..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss slapped her to the floor before she got close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You meant no harm?" Martin Weiss stared at her coldly. "Do you think you're smart, or do you think I'm a fool? If it isn&rsquo;t for the fact that you helped Kyla back then, what you've done today is enough to make you and your backer have no place in Emerald City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman instantly stiffened, and she only felt a burning pain on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said coldly, "Don't let me see you again. Otherwise, I won't go easy on you even though you've helped Kyla before! If you tell anyone else what Kyla suffered in prison, I can guarantee that you&rsquo;ll never be able to say another word."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman eventually left Martin Weiss's office while trembling all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she felt was fear. She could even feel a desire to kill from Martin Weiss when he warned her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Martin Weiss going to... kill me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I... I must be overthinking!' Jacqueline Bowman comforted herself, but the hatred in her heart grew. Her hatred and jealousy for Kyla also intensified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her mind, she encountered all this because of Kyla!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If only Kyla did not exist!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had known, she would never have helped Kyla back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Nelson fell asleep that night, Mrs. Corbyn asked her daughter, "What's come over you? You've been looking distracted after coming home today. Is there something wrong with the check-up today? Don't keep it to yourself. Just talk to me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with the check-up. The doctor just wants me to watch my diet. I shouldn&rsquo;t eat too many innards,&rdquo; said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why did you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I was just thinking about Nelson's parent-child event." She made up a random excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You can't bring yourself to speak to Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I&rsquo;ve told him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... is he too busy to go to the parent-child event?" Mrs. Corbyn guessed aloud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He'll... probably attend the parent-child," Kyla said after a moment of hesitation. Although Martin Weiss did not give her a direct answer, knowing Martin Weiss's character, he would attend since he did not refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you afraid you'll have to see him at the parent-child event?" asked Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not deny it this time. Mrs. Corbyn said, "Oh, why don't you speak to Nelson's class teacher if you're unwilling? Just say you're feeling under the weather because of your pregnancy. Not all families have both parents attend the parent-child event every time anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together and smiled to lessen her mother's worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Never mind. It's just a parent-child event. Nothing will happen even if I attend it with Martin Weiss. Besides, once the little one in my belly is born, I&rsquo;ll still have to see Martin Weiss. I can't avoid him. Why don't I just face him instead of avoiding him all the time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn said, "It's best that you&rsquo;ve thought it through. Speaking of which, he has also changed a lot. Sometimes when I look at him, I find him..." Mrs. Corbyn did not utter the word &lsquo;pitiful&rsquo; in the end.</p></div>
