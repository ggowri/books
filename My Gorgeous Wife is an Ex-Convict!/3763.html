        <h1>Chapter 3761</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mommy..." Suddenly, Veronica felt something tugging at her skirt. When she looked down, she saw a little girl pulling on her skirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she met the little girl's gaze, the girl seemed to be startled and then let go of her hand, "You...you're not my mommy...Mommy, I want my mommy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at the little girl, who was probably only 4 or 5 years old and must have gotten separated from her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry! Do you want me to help you find your mommy?" Veronica quickly crouched down and comforted the little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you really help me find my mommy?" The little girl choked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!" Veronica quickly assured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the other party was just a child who couldn't even remember her parents' phone number. After asking for a while, the only useful information was the little girl's mother and the fact that she was wearing a dress of the same color as hers. That was why the little girl mistook Veronica for her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's take you to the police station, and the police officer will help you find your mommy and daddy, okay?" Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl was already enjoying a cotton candy that Veronica had bitten into. After hearing Veronica's words, she quickly nodded her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Veronica took the little girl's hand and said to Mason, "Let's take the child to the police station first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason nodded, but after the little girl had walked for a while, she got tired and opened her arms, shouting, "Hug! I want a hug."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let me hug you." Veronica said, about to bend down to pick up the little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me do it." Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little one clearly didn't want Mason to hold her, and said in a childish voice, "I want sister to hold me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica smiled and said, "Let me hold her." At this age, the child only weighed about 30 pounds, so carrying her for a short distance shouldn't be a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do it!" Mason said, ignoring the little one's protests and picking her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want sister..." the little one didn't finish her sentence before Mason's stern look silenced her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, don't scare her," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl shrank back, clearly a little frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason asked the little girl, "Why do you want sister to hold you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl stiffened in Mason's arms and didn't dare move, her voice trembling as she said, "Because I like sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So wouldn't it be easier to be held by the sister you like?" Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little girl seemed to be seriously considering this question. After a moment, her body wasn't as stiff, and her expression wasn't as scared as before. It was as if she had gotten used to being held by Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they passed by a cake shop, the little one's face lit up with a look of longing. "Mommy said she's going to buy me a cake today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica smiled knowingly and said, "Do you want sister to buy you one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, please. Thank you, sister," the little one said sweetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Veronica had Mason put the little one down, took her hand, and went into the cake shop to pick out a cake the child would like. Mason followed behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the little girl had picked out a cake shaped like a small animal, and Mason paid for it. The little one eagerly began to eat it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica noticed the situation and decided to let the little girl sit in the cake shop and eat cake. She also ordered a warm glass of milk for the girl. At the same time, she searched for the phone number of the nearby police station online and called them to prevent the parents from reporting the child missing at the police station, thinking that the child had not been found yet.</span></p></div>
