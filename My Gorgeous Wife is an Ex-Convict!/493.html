        <h1>Chapter 492</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Grace was going through the procedures to bail Lina out, Jason called her. &ldquo;Are you at the police station?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Grace was stunned for a moment and quickly recovered. It must have been the driver who informed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m at the police station. Something happened to Lina, so I&rsquo;m here to bail her out.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason found it quite amusing. &rdquo;She needs you to help bail her out? Why didn&rsquo;t she look for Hadwin? Isn&rsquo;t he her boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;...&rdquo; It was a rather complicated situation, and it was Lina&rsquo;s private matters. &ldquo;I guess she has her own way of thinking. Anyway, I&rsquo;m in the middle of going through the paperwork. I&rsquo;ll talk to you later!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ended the call and continued with the process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson was still cursing at Lina as she was adamant that Lina was interested in her boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was so angry that she scolded Hattie Robson as a pig! She had Hadwin as her boyfriend now. Although he was just a temporary boyfriend, he did not mind that she occasionally flirted around with him or took advantage of him! Why would she need to do anything to a man she had no interest in?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, when a woman realized there was a problem in her relationship, she would rather blame another woman rather than blaming her man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace was done, she brought Lina out of the station. As they stepped out, they were met with Jason who was walking toward them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; Grace was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I came to pick you up,&rdquo; Jason said and turned to glance at Lina. He noticed that she seemed fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if it was a serious problem, he believed that Hadwin would settle it for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re done here, then let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s send Lina home first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina smiled sheepishly. &ldquo;Sorry for the trouble today.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason naturally took Grace&rsquo;s hand in his and walked toward the car. At that moment, Hattie Robson and her boyfriend, Taylor Carline, came out of the police station too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Hattie Robson saw Jason who was with Grace and Lina, she was mesmerized. After all, this kind of man could easily catch anyone&rsquo;s attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was dressed in a business suit that wrapped around his tall figure. He had broad shoulders, a slim waist, and a long pair of legs. He looked like a perfect model. Besides, he had a handsome face that on closer inspection, you could see how exquisite his features were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When this man stood still, he looked like a real-life painting that exuded elegance and royalty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Hattie Robson saw Jason and Grace holding hands, she felt jealous. &lsquo;Is this her boyfriend? Lina&rsquo;s friend looks like an ordinary woman, how did she get such a boyfriend!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson diverted all her anger on Lina toward Grace and said to Jason, &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re this woman&rsquo;s boyfriend? You better watch your girlfriend properly otherwise you can&rsquo;t guarantee that she won&rsquo;t be like her friend, seducing other people's boyfriend. After all, birds of a feather flock together!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What are you saying!&rdquo; Lina burst into anger. She did not expect that Hattie Robson would be so shameless to say such a thing to a stranger. &ldquo;Hattie Robson, if you don&rsquo;t watch what you say, I&rsquo;ll make sure you suffer even if I never find another job!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Am I spouting nonsense? Taylorsaid you were the one who seduced him!&rdquo; Hattie Robson then looked at her boyfriend and said, &ldquo;Say something! Isn&rsquo;t that the case?&rdquo;</p></div>
