        <h1>Chapter 1290</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is Jay so upset about? We've reconciled and started over. Everything's going in the right direction!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or is it only a misconception?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss ended, his face was full of misty desire, and those charming peach blossom eyes stared intently at her. "Grace..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was hoarse and soul-crushing. He whispered her name, but it seemed to make her soul tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I can't do it now. There&rsquo;s a risk of miscarriage..." She could only remind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know. I won't do that to you," he said while he panted slightly. Since she was fighting for the three children with her life, he would cherish them too. "Don't move. Just let me... hold you like this for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was already enamored. His arms carefully wrapped around her, and he was using all his restraint to suppress the desire in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stayed quietly in Jason's arms. She felt his tense body and knew that he was restraining himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Perhaps it's his willingness to exercise such restraint for me and the children that&rsquo;s making me love him more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'More?' Grace was stunned by the thought that flashed through her mind. Then, she smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to be loving him more and more. After getting over the knot in her heart, this love was also growing rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hugged Jason back and heard him mutter in her ear, "Promise me, forget about the past, okay? Let's start all over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied with a smile, "I thought we were already starting over?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Promise me you'll forget about it!" He seemed to insist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She answered, "Okay, okay. We'll forget everything that has happened before this. We'll forget everything unhappy and unpleasant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. "We'll hold a wedding ceremony after the babies are born. I want everyone to know that you're my wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would use the rest of his life to love her and spoil her to make up for the pain she had suffered. He only hoped to grow old with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson's new hearing aid was quickly ready. It was obvious that Martin Weiss had spent a lot of effort seeing as it was ready in only two days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After installing the hearing aid, the little one politely thanked Martin Weiss. "Thank you, Daddy!" Then, he hugged Kyla Corbyn who was nearby. "Mommy, I'm sorry. Next time, I'll protect the hearing aid and I won't break it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew hearing aids cost a lot of money. His mother had worked so hard to save money for his hearing aid. Afterward, he managed to install the hearing aid with Aunt's help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father gave him his current hearing aid, but the little one was somewhat confused why his father looked like the rich man in stories while his mother was poor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he would make a lot of money in the future and give his mother a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly envied the intimacy his son shared with Kyla Corbyn. His son did not reject him. He was even expectant and happy to see him sometimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his son was always careful and polite when they were together, which was quite different from the way he was with Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because of the difference between a father and a mother? Or maybe it was because he had not been with the child since the day he was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His chest felt a little stuffy at the thought that his only son had been born in prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If only I knew...' Martin Weiss experienced a heart-wrenching pain. If he had known, would he have let the child be born? Even he did not have an answer.</p></div>
