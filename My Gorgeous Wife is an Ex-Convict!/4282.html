        <h1>Chapter 4280 Her Discomfort</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't say it, choked up with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it really okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does it mean that she would rather have sex with Chandler in that way than see his hand injured so severely?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, let's go to the hospital to treat your hand injury as soon as possible," Tina said, regardless of whether it was a curse or a hex, she wanted him to take care of the wound first before dealing with everything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she took the lead and walked forward, but after a few steps, she realized that </span><span>Chandler wasn't following her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with you? Come on!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to the hospital with me?" he looked at her and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!" she replied confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler pursed his lips. "Actually, you don't have to accompany me. I can go by myself..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you going to drive with that hand, besides, my car is parked outside!" Tina said. "I'll drive you to the hospital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she headed downstairs directly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler watched Tina's figure, his eyes flickering slightly, and then he followed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two got in the car, Tina took out her phone, opened the navigation, and selected a nearby hospital before starting the car and driving towards the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you can drive," Chandler said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, I already had a driver's license. Even though I lost my memory, I didn't forget how to drive. I took driving lessons with an instructor for two weeks, so there shouldn't be any problem," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler lowered his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to know everything that happened to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they were separated, and he knew nothing about the changes she went through and what happened to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you come to my place yesterday?" Chandler asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard from Harley that you weren't feeling well and left early, so I came to check on you," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after saying this, she felt a strange sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she was saying that she cared about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to ask her about it later, how would she answer? Tina's mind started racing, trying to come up with the right response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to her surprise, Chandler said, "Like I said before, you can treat me as a stranger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what he said, Tina was taken aback for a moment, and then she pursed her lips and said, "Anyway, we have Quinn between us. We can't be strangers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car arrived at the hospital, and the two got out and came to the emergency room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the doctor saw the wound in the palm of Chandler's hand, he took a sharp breath, "Why did you come to have it treated only now? We need to clean the wound quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stood by, watching the doctor clean Chandler's hand and the blood that had stopped started to seep out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the bloody scene made her feel pain, and even more so for Chandler, who was experiencing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chandler didn't show any signs of pain on his face. Instead, he gently comforted Tina, "It doesn't really hurt that much. You don't have to stand there and watch. You can sit on the chair outside and take a break."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is this man always so gentle? Tina looked at the man in front of her and felt an inexplicable affection in her heart. "If only I had brought you to the hospital last night in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, he wouldn't have to endure this second round of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, what happened last night was my own doing. You don't need to blame yourself. Besides, you drove me to the hospital today, and that's already a great help," Chandler said softly.</span></p></div>
