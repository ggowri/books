        <h1>Chapter 1916</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Though she wanted to betray him and flee from him, and though she married him and said she loved him, it was just for the children. Though he would never matter the most to her, these... were nothing compared to her death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He suddenly could endure all the rest a little more. The only thing he could not stand was her leaving!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It did not matter how she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace smiled bitterly. She wished she could find another way as well, but in this situation, she... did not have the strength to climb up the rope ladder, and there was no way he could use one arm to pull her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps life was always about making decisions, just like how she chose to fall into the sea. That was a decision too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He heard another explosion, and he started sinking because the cracks were rapidly spreading to his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young master Reed, your side is collapsing!" someone shouted anxiously at the helicopter door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knew she was only a burden at the moment. He could have quickly climbed the rope ladder and left if not for her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, climb up... the rope ladder. It... It's okay... I... I know you love me, everything... You just have no choice!" she stammered. The thought of what would happen to her did not cross her mind at the time. All she wanted was for him to be safe and sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's enough. Stop it. I want you to stop saying that!" Jason's expression turned more and more ghastly with sweat pouring out of his forehead. He desperately tried to concentrate and come up with a way for both of them to escape. However, the more he concentrated, the more intense the pain in his head was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was so painful that he could hardly think, and scenes he had never seen before kept recurring to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was Grace sitting in a car, but half of the vehicle was hanging over the cliff. He could only look but not take a step closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What the hell is this?' He recognized that cliff. It was the cliff where Grace had fallen into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is this when Grace left me? But why is it so different from what I remember?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'No... No more! No more of these!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He kept shouting to himself, but the scenes kept recurring to him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">... He recorded his last words on the phone. If he died, all his assets would go to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">... He went to the device and tried to disarm it, but Old master Reed had played him. The old man made him choose between two options.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wanted to give his life so she could live, but... she used the time she had left and made the choice for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">... She pulled down the handbrake, and the car backed up as he watched it crash into the sea with her. Her last words were... for him to keep living and that... she loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah..." Jason let out a roar of pain. His eyes had now turned scarlet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His head... was still in pain. The pain became more and more severe. Scenes kept flooding his mind, and he was losing his grip on her hand because of the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace... hold... Hold on tight to me... Don't let go... We... We'll find a way..." Jason said through the pain as every word seemed to be squeezed through his teeth.</p></div>
