        <h1>Chapter 581</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, it was all Grace's fault! It was Grace who made her lose all she had gained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It just did not occur to Evelyn that everything she had gained was also because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had just finished delivering an order when she stepped into the small restaurant. Two figures immediately rushed over. One of them raised her hand and slapped Grace in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The slap struck so hard that Grace tottered back for several steps as she tasted blood in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You shameless creature. Are you so jealous of your little sister? How could you seduce your sister's boyfriend? Why did the Cummins family have a daughter like you?" A shrill voice followed the fall of the slap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked coldly at Melinda Riley, her stepmother. She raised her hand to ward off Melinda Riley&rsquo;s other hand as it came toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley glared at her. "Why, can't your mother hit you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace coldly said, "I only have one mother, and you're not her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who do you think your mother is? Sure enough, being shameless is also hereditary. Your mother was shameless, and the daughter she gave birth to is also shameless. All you do is seduce men..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Melinda Riley could finish her words, she was slapped into a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How... How dare you slap me?" said Melinda Riley with a look of disbelief. She had no idea her stepdaughter would dare to hit her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you don't have any affection and treat me like an enemy, why don&rsquo;t I dare to hit you?" Grace asked coldly. "Besides, in terms of shamelessness, you're the shameless one. It was only a short time after my mother's death when you married into the family. And you already seemed to be several months pregnant when you came!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, she had been more or less mindful of the fact that Melinda Riley was her elder. Even if she had insulted her and said those outrageous things to her, she would endure it all. However, ever since they threatened her with her mother's grave, she had completely given up on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Let alone now when her stepmother claimed to be her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A woman who had shamelessly seduced someone else's husband was crossing the line by saying that it was the dead woman who was shameless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be a disgrace to Grace&rsquo;s dead mother if she just endured it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley's face paled and reddened, especially now that they were in the small restaurant where the customers were all looking this way. They looked at her with disdain after hearing Grace's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could Melinda Riley stand it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to rip your mouth out!" Melinda Riley was furious and pounced on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ducked and Melinda Riley lost her pace. She ran straight into the doorway of the restaurant. Immediately, blood gushed from her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How dare you hurt me? You... You murderer. Are you going to kill me today?" When Melinda Riley saw that she was bleeding, she swore even more. She said to her husband, "Are you just going to watch your daughter hurt me?"</p></div>
