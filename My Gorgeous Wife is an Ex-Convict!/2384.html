        <h1>Chapter 2382</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one in Deer City doubted that the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family was mentally ill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the timing of Amber Mitchell's admission to the mental hospital could not have been too coincidental, given the timeline!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the shareholders' meeting was just a few days later, and given Amber Mitchell's prospects at the time, she stood a good chance of winning! However, she suddenly became a mental patient. Meanwhile, her stepsister married her fianc&eacute; right after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The biggest winner seemed to be the stepsister who shared a different mother from Amber Mitchell&mdash;Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When searching for information, Grace also looked into Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to Amber Mitchell's tragic experience, Louise Mitchell led a happy life. She was married to George Gregory, who was supposed to be her brother-in-law, with whom she had a son now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to Deer City and arrived at the mental hospital where Amber Mitchell was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a hospital staff member stopped them when they asked to visit Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They said, "I'm sorry, but we don't allow visitors other than family members."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ve been her friend for more than ten years. Can't I visit her?" Kyla said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's the hospital policy." They insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned slightly. The family would work out with the hospital on who got visitation rights. It was obvious that the family did not want outsiders to visit Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Martin Weiss took out his phone and dialed a number. "Yes, Director Wang, I'm currently in your hospital. My wife&rsquo;s friend is in your hospital. They've been friends for more than ten years, and she wants to meet her. But she can't visit her because she's not family... Okay... Thank you, then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the staff member answered a phone call and instantly changed her attitude toward the three of them. They said, "Though you can't visit the patient, Director Wang has asked me to show you around the hospital. Please follow me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By &lsquo;showing around&rsquo;, it meant they would be taken to see Amber Mitchell, of course!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Martin Weiss gratefully. "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whatever happens later, I hope you can control your emotions. And please remember that you&rsquo;re pregnant," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll be mindful!" Kyla hastened to assure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three followed the staff member as they walked around the hospital ward. Grace and Martin Weiss were on Kyla's left and right sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's ward was a VIP ward, where all the patients stayed in separate wards. Each ward door had a transparent glass window, which was convenient for doctors and nurses to check on the patients inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when the three of them approached Amber Mitchell's ward, they suddenly heard the mocking laughter of a woman. "Amber Mitchell, you look so pitiful right now. The heiress of the Mitchell family, who was so popular in the past, looks like this now. Nobody in Deer City remembers you now. Not even the gossipy reporters bother to write about you."</p></div>
