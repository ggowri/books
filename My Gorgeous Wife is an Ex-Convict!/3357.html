        <h1>Chapter 3355</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda, Brian, and several other adults came to the hotel garden after learning about the fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right now, the hotel garden is surrounded by security guards. Except for the parents of the fighting participants, no one else is allowed to enter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at several girls, all of them with disheveled hair and dirty dresses. Even Jasmine, who was usually the weakest, had several footprints on her dress and her braids were crooked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for my own daughter, don't even mention it. She looks like she's rolled around on the ground countless times. Her pink dress is now even more tattered, and as for her white leather shoes...well, she's only wearing one shoe on her foot right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to the girls who all wore light-colored clothes and looked particularly dirty, Mick, Chandler, William, and Mason looked relatively better. Although they still looked like they had just been in a fight, at least their clothes were dark in color.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for the other side of the fight, there were both boys and girls, mostly between the ages of 7 to 13 years old. Although there were fewer of them, only six in total, their age range was not as wide as the other group's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on here?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just a short while, a "war" could break out in the hotel garden?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley's little face was puffed up with anger, but strangely she didn't immediately report anything. This puzzled Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Usually, when her daughter is angry and indignant, she should take the initiative to report it. If she thinks she's at fault, she would usually try to deflect the blame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, what's going on?" Valda asked Jasper, the oldest girl in the group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper shook her head, "I...I don't know." She just saw Harley and the others fighting, and she was trying to break it up, but ended up getting involved in the fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she wasn't hurt much because William was protecting her, and no one could really hit her. William, on the other hand, had taken several punches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Valda turned her gaze to Tina, who was the first to come to the garden with Harley and the others. "Tina, tell us what happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina's face flashed a look of embarrassment and she didn't say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina said, "Tina, come on, tell us what happened and why it got so violent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina is currently feeling overwhelmed. She knows exactly what kind of person her daughter is - always causing trouble and seeking attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Usually, her daughter just likes to join in on the commotion and would run away if things got physical. However, today's fight was surprisingly brutal, which caught Lina off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina grumbled, "They were saying Auntie Valda is a cripple and an ugly freak, and they said a lot of nasty things. Harley overheard them and charged at them, demanding an apology. They refused, and then they started fighting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina began to recount the events that led to the fight. Valda was stunned. She never expected that the reason for the fight was because of her. Although Tina's explanation was vague, Valda could guess that they said some hurtful things.</p></div>
