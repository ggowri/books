        <h1>Chapter 1462</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace suddenly found it hilarious when she heard everything the two men said. 'Why is it up to others to decide whether I should learn about the truth I deserve to know?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay..." The word escaped her mouth softly. The volume was soft as usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it made the two men in the hall below stiffen instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two men looked up almost at the same time and looked in Grace's direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Their expressions instantly changed. Brian was worried and frustrated. After all, he had not intended to let others hear this. Jason had also asked all the maids to leave the main house for the same reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The purpose was to make sure no one would overhear their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, sometimes, the more you were afraid of something, the more it would happen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at Grace standing at the top of the stairway with astonishment. His face was pale, and all his blood seemed to have frozen when he heard the word &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jay... Jay...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As much as he liked hearing her call him that, he was afraid to hear it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had taken precautions against his maids and butler but not her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He thought she would sleep a little longer and not wake up so soon. He had forgotten to think of the possibility that she might wake earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why? Why am I so careless?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why didn't I even predict that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it because I knew Brian had probably found out about the truth of the case, so I was flustered and my brain was in a mess that I forgot the things I should have thought of?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And how long has Grace been standing there? How much of our conversation has she heard?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He wanted to call to her gently in his usual tone, voice, and smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his whole body seemed to be quivering. His voice seemed stuck in his throat, and it became extremely difficult to utter a single syllable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace put one hand on the handrail and walked slowly down the stairs step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The stairs, which she was accustomed to, seemed light and airy as if her feet were stepping on cotton.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His face grew paler with every step she took, and by the time she walked down the stairs and came in front of him, there was no more color in his face. Even his lips seemed to have a grayish tint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The way he looked and what she had just heard was enough for Grace to understand what the truth was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, she took a deep breath while her almond-shaped eyes sparkled with tears. "Tell me if what Brian said is true."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His lips trembled, and he opened his mouth. However, he did not know how to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Was Lily the real perpetrator?" Grace continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only then did he speak. "Grace, I... I can explain. I..." His voice, which should have been elegant and gentle, was now hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Was it Lily?" she asked persistently.</p></div>
