        <h1>Chapter 2796</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only said that at the press conference to dispel the rumors as soon as possible. Weiss Group's share price had dropped due to those rumors, causing a lot of losses. It's more effective for me to say those things instead of Martin Weiss or to have Weiss Group release a statement," said Kyla. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said with concern, "So you and Martin Weiss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll pretend to be a loving couple for a while. We'll find another excuse to announce our divorce once this is over," Kyla said before smiling. "Alright, don't worry about me. Whether it&rsquo;s pretending to be a loving couple with Martin Weiss or divorcing Martin Weiss is my own choice. No one forced me. I wanted to do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's gaze softened. "I love him. I don't want Weiss Group, which he has worked so hard to build, to suffer any more losses, so I'm willing to pretend to be a loving couple with him. However, I'm also willing to divorce him and set him free because he doesn't love me back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tone was calm when she spoke. Their love and hatred had turned into peace again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was the best outcome for her and Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, have you seen the news about Brian and Valda?" Kyla asked as she changed the topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew what news Kyla was referring to. "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Judging from the photo, Brian must be serious about Valda. I had doubts before, but I think my doubts are unnecessary now," Kyla said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So am I. I was afraid that Brian would find any random woman because of what I said to him, but it doesn't look like that now. And even though I've only met Valda a couple of times and haven't spent much time with her, I can tell she's sincere. Perhaps only such a sincere woman can move a person like Brian," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, so you should focus on looking after your unborn baby. I'm waiting for you to give birth to your baby safely and be their godmother," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Kyla left, Jason walked in. Looking at the look on his wife's face, he smiled. "Alright, it seems we have nothing to worry about anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, Kyla has her own plans. Besides, no one forced Kyla to do it. She did it willingly," said Grace, who was also relieved to know this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Worry less about other people's business. The doctor also said you shouldn't have mood swings," Jason said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it. I&rsquo;ll take good care of the baby in my belly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, your main concern is to take good care of yourself," Jason corrected her. She mattered the most to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the person in front of her. Her figure was reflected in his beautiful peach eyes as if she meant everything to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew he probably would not survive either if anything happened to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She selfishly wanted the baby and dragged him into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're right. My main concern should be taking good care of myself," she murmured. She had thought that it did not matter whether she existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had let her know how important she was to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace moved her body, trying to roll over to lie flat. She had just moved her body when she suddenly gasped and frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" he immediately asked nervously.</p></div>
