        <h1>Chapter 3628</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, this person is indeed a madman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leston, along with his few subordinates, fled in a panic, not even caring about the woman who initially called them for backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman originally wanted to run with Leston and the others, but her high heels made her lose her balance and she fell hard to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman looked panicked, her face pale, as she saw Roger approaching from behind. She pleaded, "Don't... don't come any closer. I... I was wrong, please spare me, please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You talk too much. If I spare you, then who will spare me?" Roger said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I..." Seeing the other person raising the stick in their hand, the woman instinctively covered her head with her hands and curled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud thud, the stick slammed into the ground next to the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger looked down at the woman curled up on the ground, threw the stick down, and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had taken her life, it wouldn't change anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper chose William, and for her, he was ultimately insignificant. That's why she could abandon him so quickly back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to pay back..." Roger murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he came to Stanford University, the reason he approached Jasper, it was all just for revenge. So he shouldn't hesitate anymore, shouldn't have any soft feelings because of Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she... just isn't worth it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...The news about Jasper and William dating has become the hottest gossip at Stanford University, especially with all the negative things happening to William recently. And for Jasper to face so many cameras and publicly declare their relationship at this time, it takes a lot of courage that not everyone has.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, there are also many people who think Jasper is just love-struck and doesn't care about the consequences of her words, possibly dragging down the entire Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this whole thing has started fermenting online too. Despite both the Reed family and the Barlow family trying to suppress the news, with the internet being so developed nowadays, as long as someone searches, they will still find quite a few related posts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jasper doesn't bother to pay attention to other people's opinions. Since she's already clear about William's importance in her heart and understands that she loves him, she will stick with him till the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, um, your grandfather is in the hospital now. Are you planning to visit him?" Because of public opinion, William took a few days off and didn't go to the school, instead staying at the Barlow family's villa in Emerald City. So Jasper also took a leave of absence to accompany William in the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper saw some information online and knew that Harold had a heart attack and was hospitalized, while Camelia has been staying at the hospital with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the two elderly people don't have much money, and now they're relying on donations from some netizens for their treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I say I don't want to visit him, would you think I'm heartless?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked her eyes, "Why would I think you're heartless? They haven't done anything good for you, haven't even raised you for a day. Even if you don't visit them, it's completely understandable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William smiled and her words relieved his heart. "But many people online are saying that I am heartless, that they are in the hospital and I don't care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it just because you're related to them?" Jasper asked. "But sometimes, blood ties can be the strongest bond in this world, and other times, they can be fragile and easily broken. I believe that blood ties need to be nurtured with love in order to have meaning. Otherwise, they mean nothing at all."</span></p></div>
