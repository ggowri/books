        <h1>Chapter 2973</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was just an angry woman, but she was completely unaware of it. She continued to speak recklessly, "Your social status is naturally high, but if you associate with people like her, others might think you have some issues or a peculiar taste. People like her are only suitable for those who are poor..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words were interrupted by a strong tug on her sleeve from a friend standing beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing? I haven't finished speaking yet!" The woman said displeased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, she...she was just talking nonsense. Please don't take it to heart!" The friend was already apologizing repeatedly to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why wouldn't I mind? If she dares to speak ill of my girlfriend, of course I would mind!" Brian said in a cold tone, his face showing a chilling expression. Even the air pressure around him seemed to have dropped significantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman only realized it now and showed a frightened expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I spoke out of turn, Brian...please forgive me..." The woman's voice trembled as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said in a cold tone, "The person you should be asking for forgiveness is not me, but my girlfriend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman quickly turned to Valda and said, "Miss, the things I said earlier were all nonsense. I apologize to you and promise not to speak recklessly again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda pursed her lips tightly and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman, upon seeing this, immediately lifted her hand and fiercely slapped herself on the cheek, repeatedly hitting herself with several slaps until her face became swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked up and said to Brian, "Brian, let's go. Otherwise, it wouldn't be good to keep your parents waiting for too long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this enough?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as he spoke, the woman became nervous and looked at Valda with a frightened and pitiful expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda simply pulled Brian's hand and said, "Let's go." Before, she really wanted an apology from him, but now that he had apologized, she felt a sense of boredom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that the woman wasn't genuinely apologizing, but was only doing so out of fear of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, let's go," said Brian as he took Valda's hand and walked towards the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman and her friend finally breathed a sigh of relief, and the woman herself almost collapsed onto the ground!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the person I met in the restroom would turn out to be Brian's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shouldn't men like Brian be looking for a girlfriend who is stunning and has an outstanding temperament? But the person just now was completely like an ordinary girl next door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But it's this petite and delicate girl that Brian is protecting with all his might. He even looks at his girlfriend with such tenderness that it's...jealousy-inducing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda and Brian stepped out of the elevator, Brian suddenly said, "What's wrong? Are you still feeling upset? I thought that person apologized to you and you would feel better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She only apologized because of your relationship with her. Actually, I should be happy that you're protecting me, but at the same time, I can't help but think, what if you weren't here with me today? What if we weren't in a romantic relationship and I was alone? In that case, she would never apologize to me, and I might not even have a way to seek justice!" Valda said.</p></div>
