        <h1>Chapter 4123</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Hadwin looked at Chandler with a strange expression, as if he was looking at an alien or with a hint of sympathy and pity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler really wanted to shout out loud, it's not what they think!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But at this moment, he couldn't find the words to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It's as if all the voices were frozen in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, Dad, how did you eavesdrop!" Tina complained, the atmosphere was so good just now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now that her parents are back, the atmosphere has been completely disrupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What eavesdropping? Tell us, what's going on? Why are you leaving Chandler?" Lina approached and pulled her daughter, asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, I'm not leaving Chandler, I just wanted him to... um, express himself." Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Express?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just in case I really want to leave him in the future, he must try to keep me like he said earlier!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"... "Lina felt speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although she is her own daughter, her daughter's way of thinking is truly unique!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And Hadwin glanced at the somewhat helpless Chandler, and asked with a half-smile, "Can you really do what you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler sweated a little, and after a while, he awkwardly spit out a "yes".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hadwin nodded in satisfaction, "Okay then, don't forget the words you said today in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler lowered his eyelids lightly, wondering if that day would really come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If one day, she really decided to leave him, what would he do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could he restrain that twisted possessiveness and let her go peacefully?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I heard that you met the young miss of the Stephenson family today and even took her home?" Edmond Ingram looked at his son and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit Ingram replied lightly, "Yes, that's true."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This young miss from the Stephenson family seems to be different towards you. She started a scandal with you, and even went to the film and television city to see you. What do you think of her?" Edmond asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She's just a fan." Kit's tone remained unchanged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Nowadays, fans are willing to do a lot of things for their favorite idol. If she really likes you that much, then she must be willing to do a lot for you." Edmond said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She's just a student, I don't need her to do anything for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But she's not just an ordinary student, she's the heiress of the Stephenson family. If she's willing to help our Ingram family by saying a few words, it would benefit both the Ingram family and the Stephenson family, isn't that right?" Edmond hinted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit frowned slightly, and Edmond patted his shoulder. "You know, our family business has been declining in the past few years. If you can get Miss Stephenson to speak up for the Ingram family in front of her father, then the Ingram family can benefit from collaborating with the Stephenson family. Our future will be better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit pursed his lips almost into a straight line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, when it's time for your concert, I'll send Miss Stephenson tickets. You can get to know her more," Edmond said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, aren't you forgetting that Miss Stephenson is engaged? And her fianc&eacute; is Chandler. Aren't you afraid that if I get too close to her, her fianc&eacute; will retaliate against the Ingram family?" Kit blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm not asking you to ruin the engagement between the Stephenson family and the Hunter family. I just want you to have more interactions with Miss Stephenson, which will benefit the Ingram family in getting on board with the Stephenson family. Having a confidante isn't a bad thing, right?" Edmond smiled and spoke in a tone that seemed to be mocking his son's innocence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit lowered his eyelids halfway. A confidante... that's what his father expected, but not what he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew very well that, to his father, he was just a pawn.</p></div>
