        <h1>Chapter 3691</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The concert began, and the stage and audience were lively. Tina and Jasmine were waving their glow sticks with excitement, fully immersed as qualified fans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mason, sitting in his seat, seemed to be isolated from the noise and excitement, with his head down, lost in thought, looking so out of place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the intermission, Tina and Jasmine went to the restroom, and Mason and Chandler naturally followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in the rest area outside the restroom, Chandler looked at Mason and asked, "I saw you seemed to be thinking about something during the concert. Were you thinking about Veronica?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason coldly looked at him and said, "You better not mention the name 'Veronica' in front of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By now, do you really not want to hear those three words?" Chandler said. "The more you don't want to hear them, the more it shows that you care."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Care? Mason snorted. How could he possibly care? His feelings for Veronica had long been forgotten due to hypnosis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't," he denied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Chandler smiled. "Just now, you got dirty because you were protecting Veronica."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason suddenly furrowed his brows, then took a step forward and grabbed Chandler's collar. "You're not someone who meddles in other people's business. What do you really want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler calmly allowed himself to be pulled by his collar. "I guess it's because I find it strange."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strange?" Mason was puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can someone who once cared so much really forget about it because of hypnosis? Can someone just stop loving another person just by saying so?" Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you find it strange, then you can try it," Mason said in a cold voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't," Chandler said with great certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't because you think Tina will eventually fall in love with you?" Mason said sarcastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if she doesn't, I won't give up," Chandler said. "Tina is my own choice. I chose her even before she was born. Since this is my choice, I will naturally work hard for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she doesn't love you, then your efforts will be useless," Mason said bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't make an effort, how can I expect her to fall in love with me?" Chandler retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them faced each other, their faces very close, until Tina's voice interrupted them. "What are you guys doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler and Mason turned their heads and saw Tina and Jasmine had already come out of the restroom. The two women were now staring at them with wide eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine asked curiously, "Mason, are you going to kiss Chandler?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Mason and Chandler's faces changed immediately. Mason quickly let go of Chandler's hand, and the two men instinctively stepped back, creating some distance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pulled Jasmine's arm and whispered, "You can't be so straightforward about these things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine was confused and asked, "Why not? But Tina, in the comic book you showed me, there were two men kissing!"</span></p></div>
