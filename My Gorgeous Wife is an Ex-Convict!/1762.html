        <h1>Chapter 1760</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence froze. He remembered what had happened in the past when Jason pressed the detonating device after leaving his last words, disregarding his own danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as Jason said that, his men were naturally afraid to stop him. Jason drove toward the hill, which was still ringing with the sound of explosions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence and the others rushed over to catch up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily stared blankly through the window and watched Jason's car drive away. 'Is this man planning to risk his life and go up the hill to save Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had the affections of this man, which her sister previously longed for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sis, do you see this? It turns out the man you loved has the ability to love another woman with all he has!" Lily laughed sarcastically, wondering what her sister would think if she knew that the man she loved was in love with another woman with all he had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She would laugh at her sister when she died and saw her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, if she did meet her sister after she died, she would be the one her sister hated the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She killed her sister to gain a fortune for the Atkinson family and blamed it all on Grace for Sean. She was the one who planned everything, but it all resulted in nothing in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Haha... Haha... Jason, even if you rush over, you can't save Grace. There's no way you can save her!" Lily cursed with a flash of resentment in her eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sound of explosions continued to ring beside Grace. She was desperately protecting the unconscious Mason in her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if she had to risk her life, she would bring Mason down the hill!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the constant explosions had produced a lot of smoke. Rubble, dirt, and twigs continued to be tossed into the air from the ground. It hurt when they hit her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Go down the hill... We need to go down the hill.' Just then, she suddenly heard someone say, "Watch out!" Then, a hand grabbed her shoulder and pulled her to the side. With Mason in her arms, Grace fell awkwardly to the side along with the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A tree had fallen at the spot where Grace stood earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was instantly terrified. If she had not been pulled aside, the tree would have fallen on Mason and her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you okay? Can you get up?" The voice rang out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace shuddered. 'This voice...' She looked up at the person and saw Brian's delicate face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Brian's face was covered with dust and dirt at this moment, making him look like a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What are you doing here?" Grace asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian said, "It's a long story. I'll tell you about it later. Let's get out of this place first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace staggered to her feet as she held Mason in her arms. Brian said, "Let me hold the child. It'll make running down the hill quicker."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace hesitated a little before saying, "Thank you... then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Brian was right. Men had a natural advantage when it came to strength. It was easier for him to carry Mason and they could speed up their descent as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The most important thing now was to get down the hill!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian took Mason from Grace and ran down the hill. There were occasional explosions on the rugged hill roads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lily probably didn&rsquo;t plant too many explosives. It should all be over now," said Brian.</p></div>
