        <h1>Chapter 2558</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could she love Herman Moss? I'm the one she loves!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he kissed her, she would respond and show him she loved him with her actions!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she responded with a violent struggle and resistance to push him away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, George Gregory hugged Amber Mitchell tighter and deepened the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was a sharp pain in his mouth, followed by the taste of blood. Then, a sudden force suddenly pushed him away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A clear and loud slap hit him on one side of his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He watched blankly at the right hand she swung out. The sting on his cheek and the blood in his mouth told him what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she... resist me so much?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, don't touch me. The more you touch me, the more disgusted I feel," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amby, I just..." He tried to say something, but he then saw her mutilated right hand and the missing right ring finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All his words seemed to be stuck in his throat, and he could not say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell turned to leave, while George Gregory stood there like a statue, motionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Amber Mitchell walked out of the hospital, she saw Daley Moss's car parked not far away. The driver walked up to her and said, "Miss Mitchell, Mr. Moss asked you to get in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell followed the driver to the car and got in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the driver did not get in the car. Amber Mitchell and Daley Moss were the only ones in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Simon really your child?" Daley Moss asked. He was also surprised to hear George Gregory say that. After all, the Gregory family's heir had always been Louise Mitchell and George Gregory's child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said, "I think so. The hospital issued a DNA test report. The chances of it being a mistake are slim, and Simon's disease requires his immediate relative to help with the transfusion. There's no way George Gregory would deceive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn't know?" Daley Moss asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell shook her head. "I don't know why my child became Louise Mitchell's, but I&rsquo;ll save him and love him well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had imagined many times how she would love the child and how she would become a good mother if her child were still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now... the child was still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Congratulations on having a child." Daley Moss chuckled but looked at Amber Mitchell more sharply. "As soon as George Gregory divorces Louise Mitchell, the three of you will be a happy family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell froze before looking at Daley Moss sternly. "I'm already married to Herman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But isn't it better to marry the living than the dead? Besides, George Gregory still seems to have feelings for you. Besides, Simon is your son," said Daley Moss.</p></div>
