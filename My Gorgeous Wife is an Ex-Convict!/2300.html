        <h1>Chapter 2298</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"N-Nothing. Am I interrupting? Why don't I sit outside and let you handle work first?" said Grace as she moved to walk away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly grabbed her. "No need, we're done discussing." Then, he gave Terrence, who was not far away, a look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence immediately said, "Yeah, Young Madam. We're done discussing. You can talk to Young master Reed. I'll go out first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Terrence quickly left the office and closed the door quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the current Young master Reed, Terrence was filled with emotions. Who would have imagined that Young master Reed, who was emotionally cold and seemed to have distanced himself from everyone, would be so deeply in love with a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young master Reed had changed because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence liked the current Young master Reed better. Although he had a weakness now, he was more human.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, having weaknesses was not a bad thing. People with weaknesses were more human!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the office, Jason looked at Grace and asked, "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me hug you for a minute first," she said as she wrapped her hands around his waist. Her face was buried in his chest, and she listened to his heartbeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was steady and strong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It calmed down her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He let her hug him quietly as if she could hug him forever if she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla... broke up with Martin Weiss. I don't think they'll ever be together again." After a long time, Grace finally spoke sullenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "Are your eyes red because of them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla came to my firm today, and I learned that she has made things clear to Martin Weiss in the hospital today. I thought that Kyla would be with Martin Weiss after this incident. After all, Martin Weiss has a place in Kyla's heart. Anyone can see how worried and scared Kyla was when Martin Weiss was injured and lying on the operating table, but... Kyla eventually chose not to be with Martin Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason comforted, saying, "That's her choice. Alright, don't be sad. I know that Kyla is your friend. But as outsiders, we only see one side of it. She must have made that choice because she thinks it's for the best."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe," murmured Grace while holding Jason a little tighter. "I just wonder why is it so hard for two people to be together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was driving from the store to Reed group, she thought of their past and felt like crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I had chosen to break up with you as Kyla did, would we&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He interrupted quickly, "No! Even if you did choose to separate from me, I would&rsquo;ve tried my best to make you choose to be with me again. Grace, I won't let you go even if I die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said as he lowered his head, held Grace's face in both hands, and gazed at her. "What about you? If you were given another chance, would you choose to leave me?"</p></div>
