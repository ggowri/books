        <h1>Chapter 3405</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm afraid of you? Don't make me laugh. I can say it again and again. You're just a criminal's son. Do you think being the young master of the Barlow family makes you special? No matter what, you can't erase the fact that you have the blood of a criminal running through your veins..." Yvonne said recklessly, not knowing any better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as William was about to make a move, a hand moved even faster than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yvonne suddenly heard a loud and crisp slap, and in the next moment, she covered her cheek in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person who hit her was none other than today's protagonist - Jasper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yi... Jasper, did you hit me?" Yvonne asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, so what if I hit you? If you dare to say such things, why wouldn't I dare to hit you?" Jasper said, feeling his palms burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the first time she had ever slapped someone, and even she didn't know how she had managed to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She only heard what the other person said, got very angry, and then slapped them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He...his mommy is a criminal, and she even harmed your mommy. I'm speaking up for your family, why did you still hit me?" said Yvonne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stared at the other person and said, "Our family matters don't require your help, and today is my birthday banquet. I don't welcome you to attend, so please leave immediately. If you don't leave, I will have the security guards escort you out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said this without any room for maneuver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yvonne was furious, "You... want to kick me out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can't I still catch up with you?" Jasper asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This statement made Yvonne's face turn red and white. After a moment, she glared at Jasper and William with hatred, then turned around and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of being forcibly removed by security later, she would rather find an excuse to leave early on her own and save face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Yvonne never expected that Jasper would protect William like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Let's wait and see!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yvonne thought to herself that she would eventually get revenge for today's humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Yvonne left, Jasper turned to William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, William lowered his head, his long eyelashes covering his eyes, making it impossible to know what he was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper held William's hand and said, "Let's go. I have some new friends who haven't met you yet and want to get to know you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But William didn't take a step, instead he suddenly said, "Do you... still want to be friends with me, be with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Jasper didn't understand at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William raised his head and looked at Jasper with a steady gaze, "Like the woman just said, my mother is the one who harmed your mother. I am the son of a criminal. Would you still want to be with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper raised his eyes and looked at him. At this moment, his face was pale, and his gaze towards William was even cautious and nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper thought for a moment, then reached out his hand and extended it towards William's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As her hand was about to touch his, he shuddered slightly and seemed to want to avoid it.</p></div>
