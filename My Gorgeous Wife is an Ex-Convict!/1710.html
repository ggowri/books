        <h1>Chapter 1708</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since he felt no pain, what difference did it make if his bruises healed quickly or slowly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if it doesn't hurt, it may affect your health if you&rsquo;re injured and you don&rsquo;t get yourself treated. You&rsquo;re only suffering from superficial injuries this time, but if you hurt your bones and you don&rsquo;t seek treatment just because you&rsquo;re not in pain, then you may have to walk with a limp forever.&rdquo; Grace tried to explain things as simply as she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one was silent as if thinking over her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace added, "Would you like to change your home? What about staying with me and Uncle Reed? Then no one will ever hit you again and you won't suffer from these kinds of injuries."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason instantly grew vigilant. The way he looked at Grace had also changed. He appeared fierce, like a small animal that was ready to pounce and bite at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt that Mason was looking at her as though he was looking at his enemy. She felt a sudden pang of pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason took a step forward and stood between the little one and Grace, just in case Mason did something to hurt Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We're not going to separate you from your sister. We just want to give you a better home," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I only want to be with Sis!" the little one said stubbornly and growled at Jason like a small animal protesting against an unusually powerful beast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared at the little one's face. His eyes suddenly darkened, and he narrowed his eyes as if to take a closer look at Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, school was over and the students came out one by one. The little one immediately rushed to Veronica Barlow when he saw her coming out. His small hands grabbed Veronica Barlow tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm never leaving my sister." He seemed particularly determined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Carrying a small school bag, Veronica Barlow asked curiously, "Who wants to separate us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason's eyes turned to Grace. The next moment, Veronica Barlow rushed up to Grace and said, "I thought you were nice. I can't believe you want to separate Ci and me. I'm telling you, we're not going to separate from each other. I... I'll try to save up to pay back the medical fees I owe you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You can pay me back anytime you want, and I don't want to separate you from your brother. I just... want to adopt your brother and give him a better home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No thanks. I'll take care of Ci!" Veronica Barlow held Mason tightly. "I'll take good care of Ci. He's my brother and family. He's not going anywhere with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, she asked her brother who was in her arms, "Ci, am I right?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I only want Sis to take care of me!" Mason also said affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two little ones hugged each other, making Grace look like a bad person. Students and parents were also looking their way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It seems that the child is refusing to come with us, and the same goes for the sister. We'd better go," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace sighed and nodded. Before leaving, she said to the two siblings, "Since you&rsquo;ve refused, I won't mention it again. Here's my phone number. Call me if you get into any trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, she handed Veronica Barlow a piece of paper with her phone number on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow hesitated a little but took Grace's note anyway.</p></div>
