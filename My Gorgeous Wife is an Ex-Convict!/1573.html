        <h1>Chapter 1571</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the car arrived at the gate of Lina's neighborhood, she lowered her head and unbuckled the seat belt. She whispered a thank you and was about to open the car door when Hadwin Stephenson's voice suddenly rang out...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you going to date that man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina paused. It took her a while to figure out that by &lsquo;that man&rsquo;, he meant Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He's pretty good. He's financially stable and we have a few things in common. Besides, I'm good-looking too. It'd be good to date him if he likes me," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You want to date him just because of that? In that case, do you like him?" he asked, glaring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She felt a sudden sense of amusement. "Why not? A man like him is a man many women would want to marry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina!" His voice rose, and there was a faint trace of anger in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was a little confused why he was so angry. 'Is he mad at me for falling for another man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He was the one who didn&rsquo;t want me. Besides, he has a girlfriend himself. Why does he care whether I have a boyfriend?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, I don't know why you wanted to appear in front of me. Is it just a coincidence? Or did you come to see me on purpose? But I already have nothing to do with you. Just like what I said before, I won't ruin your relationship with your girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a pause, she said, "Even though we&rsquo;ve broken up, I still hope you can lead a good and happy life." After all, the man in front of her was the man she had once truly loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They only broke up because they shared different ideas. She could not help him with his career. Rather than romance&hellip; what he wanted more was to succeed in his career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As she spoke, Lina extended her hand to Hadwin Stephenson to shake hands and say goodbye. "Goodbye... then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he hesitated to reach out and shake her hand. He continued to stare at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She suddenly laughed at herself as if something had occurred to her. "You must dislike me touching you, don't you? Well then, I hope I don't see you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because meeting him again would only disturb her peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina opened the car door. Before she got out of the car, Hadwin Stephenson grabbed one of her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He held it so tightly that the bones of her fingers ached, and his face seemed to have grown paler now. "Lina, I... I&rsquo;ve never hated you. I just want you to live. If you encounter any difficulties, you can come to me and I&rsquo;ll help you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He suddenly let go of her hand after saying this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car door closed, and the car drove away. Lina stood there, dumbfounded. She looked in the direction of the departing car. She looked at the hand he had just held and felt confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What did Hadwin Stephenson mean when he said that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, we&rsquo;ve broken up," she murmured to herself as if she was warning herself. Since they had already broken up, they would have nothing to do with each other anymore. Otherwise, she would just get stuck in this and it would be harder and harder for her to move on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On Saturday, Lina met with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why didn't you bring the two little ones out?" asked Lina. She wanted to see them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Something seemed to be bothering you when I talked to you on the phone earlier, so I didn't bring the two little ones out. If you want to see them, I'll bring them out next time," said Grace.</p></div>
