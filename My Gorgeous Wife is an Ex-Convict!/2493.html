        <h1>Chapter 2491</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got into the car. Whitney Cooper clenched her teeth in hatred and drove home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian was sitting on the couch inside when she opened the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian!" Whitney Cooper looked surprised. "What are you doing here? You could&rsquo;ve called me if you wanted to see me and I would&rsquo;ve come straight to you.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only looked at Whitney Cooper coldly. It was different from his usual indifference. The look in his eyes instantly made Whitney Cooper uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"W-What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you meet Grace today?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you know that?" Whitney Cooper blurted out, and that amounted to a direct admission. Then, she hesitated slightly before asking, "Did Grace tell you that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It has nothing to do with her. Let me ask you. Why did you go look for Grace? What did you say to her?" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not have known about it if Whitney Herrera had not called him and said she happened to see Whitney Cooper meeting Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would sometimes meet Whitney Herrera to talk about their cooperation, so he had brought Whitney Cooper along on several occasions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera knew Whitney Cooper, of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I didn't say anything. I just told her I'm your private secretary..." murmured Whitney Cooper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And?" Brian demanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And... I hope she could make things easier for you." Whitney Cooper's almond-shaped eyes glistened with tears as she pretended to seem aggrieved. "Brian, I know you've been thinking about her. You've been handling her affairs, especially after coming to Deer City. If this goes on for a long time, those gossipy reporters will write about it. Your reputation will suffer." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at her almond-shaped eyes that were similar to Grace's. Her eyes were what caught his attention when he saw the woman in front of him at the nightclub back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because her eyes were similar to Grace's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strangely, Grace's tears made his heart ache, while Whitney Cooper's tears only disgusted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if her almond-shaped eyes were similar to Grace's, the light in her eyes was different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "I seem to have doted on you too much and misled you. Whitney Cooper, you're only my private secretary. You have no right to decide who I think about. You shouldn't think about what will happen to my reputation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I love you." Since meeting him in the nightclub and finding out he was the one who saved her, she had been yearning for him. She had been constantly trying hard to stay by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What woman could not love a man of his wealth, status, and intelligence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You love me?" Brian seemed to have heard a joke as a sarcastic smile appeared on his indifferent lips. "You love me? What do you love about me? Do you love me enough to risk anything for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I love everything about you, of course. I would sacrifice everything for you!" Whitney Cooper said quickly, "I can make an oath if you don't believe me!"</p></div>
