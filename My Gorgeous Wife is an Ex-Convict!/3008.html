        <h1>Chapter 3006</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It should be soon, within three days," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And indeed, the next day, Yvo and his wife came to the school, apologized to the school leaders and Mr. Yeats, and kept saying that they were wrong, that they had wrongly accused Mr. Yeats, and that they were sorry. They were crying and almost kneeling down in front of Mr. Yeats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The school leaders were all stunned by what they saw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, the education bureau also issued a notice, directly transferring and punishing the staff who had given Yvo and his wife the green light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the school side, Mr. Yeats' transfer was also cancelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of this happened so quickly that it caught everyone off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Yeats was completely stunned. He had already prepared for the worst, but now everything was back to normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing Valda and Brian's names from Yvo and his wife, he suddenly understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of this was thanks to Valda and her boyfriend's help!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After receiving a notice of transfer cancellation from the school, Mr. Yeats came to Valda's studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was surprised when she saw Mr. Yeats and exclaimed, "Mr. Yeats, what brings you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me say thank you to you," Zoran Yeats expressed his gratitude, "Valda, it was you and your boyfriend who helped me. Otherwise, how could those parents of the students come to school and apologize to me? The school would not have revoked their decision to transfer me either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just don't want you, Mr. Yeats, to be falsely accused because you stick to your principles," Valda said. "When I was in trouble before, you helped me, and now that I have the ability, I should help you too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I actually had limited help in assisting you. It was your own hard work that led to such achievements," said Zoran Yeats. "I have also heard from students that your current boyfriend is very talented and is a prince in the entertainment industry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda introduced Brian earlier, Zoran Yeats thought he looked different from others, but didn't think much of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Until later on, I found out from Brian's own students that he had a significant background.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I can tell that he loves you very much. I'm sure that if you two are together in the future, you will be very happy. And if you get married in the future, don't forget to invite me to the wedding so I can have a drink to celebrate with you," said Zoran with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He... loves me?" Valda asked a bit strangely upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, you can tell from the way he looks at you that he really loves you," said Zoran Yeats. "Many people can say sweet words, but words can deceive. However, the eyes cannot deceive, especially in front of people like us who study art."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda bit her lip, knowing that Mr. Yeats used to paint portraits and was skilled at observing people's expressions and emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Yeats, do you really think that I can tell from his eyes that he loves me?" Valda hesitated and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean? Doesn't he love you? Don't you know?" Now it was Zoran Yeats who was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt a little embarrassed and touched her nose. "I only know that he likes me a lot, but as for 'love', I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart loves you. You can ask him yourself to see if what I said is true. Actually, you should be able to feel his attitude towards you in your daily interactions. Love is not something that can be expressed in words, but rather felt," Zoran Yeats said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Zoran Yeats left, Valda fell into deep thought. Did Brian really love her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she didn't know that Brian loved Grace, she would have thought that Brian loved her based on their interactions over the past few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it possible? Could she be that lucky?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could Brian fall in love with her in such a short amount of time?</p></div>
