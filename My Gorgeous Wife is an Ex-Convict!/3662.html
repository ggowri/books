        <h1>Chapter 3660</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His series of questions left her speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, do you even know what I've been through all these years? What right do you have to say 'how could you do this'?" He took a step closer, his voice even colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand hanging by her side tightened slightly, as if gathering courage. "Yes, I don't know what you've been through all these years. You can tell me and let me know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, his eyes darkening. "What makes you think I should tell you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you hate me, dislike me? Then tell me, make me feel even more guilty, make me feel even more sorry for you, let me make up for the pain you've suffered!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her steadily. "I've already said it. If you really feel sorry and want to make it up to me, then why don't you have an affair with me while you're with William?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't love me at all, why would you suggest that?" She was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's interesting," he said. "Being able to date the Miss of the Reed family while being with the eldest son of the Barlow family. Don't you think it's an interesting thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feelings shouldn't be played with like this," Jasper said. "If you want to take revenge on me, then you can choose something else. I can take it one by one. But this is between you and me. I don't want to involve anyone else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, can you handle my revenge?" Roger said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a car stopped by the side of the road. A figure hurriedly got out of the car and ran to Jasper's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at the person in surprise. "William, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard from your family that you went to school in the evening, and when I got to the school gate, I heard someone say you were here," William said, glancing at Roger. "Lawrence, Jasper has been looking for you all these years. Everyone else has given up, but she hasn't. She really cares about you. Please don't take your anger out on her for what happened in the past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, this is between Jasper and me. You don't need to interfere," Roger said unkindly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm her boyfriend. If you have any dissatisfaction or resentment towards Jasper, you can come to me. Or, you can tell us how to make it up to you," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger sneered. "Make it up? I've already told Jasper how to make it up, but she doesn't seem willing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William turned to Jasper, and a look of embarrassment flashed across her face. "William, this is between him and me. It's better for me to solve it myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just worried about you. Whatever happens, I want to face it with you," William said, holding Jasper's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger glanced at their clasped hands and felt a sharp pain. He snorted and said to Jasper, "If what you wanted to talk to me about today was just what you said, then I think you already know what I mean. And also-"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger looked at William again and said, "Don't call me Lawrence anymore. Lawrence died when I was 10 years old. Now, I am just Roger. I hope you won't call me by the wrong name again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Roger turned around and left.</span></p></div>
