        <h1>Chapter 4105</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who...who are you?" the women shouted at Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Me? I'm also a fan of Kit!" Tina smiled and said, "As a fan, we should have the integrity of a fan. We should understand and respect our idols. We shouldn't just demand that our idols satisfy our own desires. For example, Kit doesn't look well now. Shouldn't we let him leave early and rest?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit was surprised. Except for his assistant, no one else knew that he wasn't feeling well. Even the organizers and fans at the event didn't notice, but Tina did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You just want to say something pleasing to gain attention from Kit! What do you mean by stepping on us to get close to Kit?" The woman who fell down first was angry and embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Something pleasing?" Tina sneered, "I'm just telling the truth. Besides, I recorded the scene when you fell down and what you said. If you really feel dissatisfied, I can post this video online and let everyone judge!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she shook the phone in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The women causing trouble looked ugly and left in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Other fans didn't say anything anymore. Kit walked up to Tina and said, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't expect to see you here, but your complexion really doesn't look good. Get in the car and rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." Kit agreed, trying to take a step forward, but stumbled and fell to the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Be careful!" Tina, who was closest to him, instinctively reached out to grab Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But due to the momentum of the force, it ended up with her pulling Kit into her arms!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Around them, there was a sudden gasp of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina herself was tall and had a somewhat androgynous style among the girls. When Kit leaned into her arms, it didn't give people a sudden feeling, but rather looked like a beautiful picture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you okay?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm...I'm fine, sorry!" Kit straightened up, and the assistant next to him also hurried over to support him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good thing you're okay, be careful when you walk," Tina reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay!" Kit replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group got into the car, and Tina left with them. The fans who had originally gathered in the alley also scattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the nanny car, the assistant said to Kit, "Are you feeling unwell? Do you want to go to the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it's okay. There's medicine in the apartment. I'll take two and be fine. Let's just drive back to the apartment first," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car slowly drove off, and Kit slowly closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Tina appeared just now, he inexplicably felt relieved. And when she supported him and leaned into her arms, it made him feel like he suddenly became comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why is that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He and Tina have only had a few brief encounters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or is it because they worked together and she became his fan after watching his performance in his music video a long time ago, as she once mentioned?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could see his efforts when no one else did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Similarly, she could notice when he wasn't feeling well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina...the number of times he thought of that name seemed to have increased unconsciously!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p></div>
