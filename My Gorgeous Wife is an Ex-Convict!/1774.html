        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had said yes right away, Lily would have hesitated. However, Brian only agreed on such a condition, hence Lily felt reassured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I'll tell you what happened and why Grace fell into the sea. But... Brian, I'm afraid you&rsquo;d rather not know anything after hearing it," said Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian's face froze after hearing what Lily said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "Brian, I just hope that you&rsquo;ll keep your word."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had never felt indebted to anyone in her life. She had never even felt sorry for the sister she killed, the now severely injured Sean, or her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She would not have killed her sister if her parents had not been so biased toward her, and she would not hate Sean so much if he had been more sincere to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she kept feeling indebted to William...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">William... She did not even know who his biological father was. All she remembered was that she had gotten drunk one night and met a man on the streets who looked like a drug addict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That place had all kinds of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, the man was pretty good-looking, and he aroused her. Hence, she took that man to the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After that, she never met the man again. She did not even know who the man was. Perhaps he had died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Later, she got pregnant with William. She had thought about aborting him, but she somehow relented and gave birth to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The boy had given her little concern in the last few years. Even in the first few months of his life, he would only cry out when he was hungry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she was out at work, he would quietly play with the cheap toys she had bought for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he was hungry, he would obediently eat what she prepared. He never threw a tantrum. Sometimes, she even thought that the child was too quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had always treated the child as dispensable. To her, raising a child was like keeping a mere pet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, everything changed when she caught a fever one day and could hardly get out of bed. The four-year-old boy had cooked porridge for her in a rice cooker. He even brought her fever medicine and water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she woke up in the middle of the night, she saw that the boy was still awake. His dark eyes had been looking at her the whole time. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why are you still up?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm scared that you're going to die. Are you going to die?" his young voice asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if I die, you don't have to worry. Welfare will take you in. You're good-looking, so maybe a good family will adopt you," she said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But you're my only mommy," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, her heart, which had grown colder over the years, seemed to have cracked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"William... Maybe I'm really leaving you this time," murmured Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
