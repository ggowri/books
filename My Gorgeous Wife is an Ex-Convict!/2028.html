        <h1>Chapter 2026</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We only took a couple of photos together and shook hands. Then, they said we&rsquo;re welcome to visit the set at any time," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The director hurriedly stepped forward with the two leading actors, introduced himself, and said with a smile, "It's our honor that Miss Sweeney and Mrs. Reed enjoy our drama. We'll work harder in filming the sequel!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The film crew was delighted that Lina and Grace liked their work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, if the film crew ever ran into trouble, maybe these people could help them solve it. It was always better to have more connections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can also visit us at any time. I can give you a more detailed filming schedule if you want," the director said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You have a more detailed schedule?" Lina's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, we do. We do..." However, the director stopped speaking halfway because the way Hadwin Stephenson looked at him was somewhat dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, it's almost noon now. Let's get something to eat first," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah, I wanna go to the washroom first," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll go with Lina," said Grace. After all, Lina was pregnant. She would be worried if Lina went to the washroom alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two of them came to the cafe's bathroom entrance and heard a voice inside saying, "Why is Lina so smug? Even though she&rsquo;s pregnant, she still failed to join the Stephenson family, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know, right? Does she think she's the mistress of the Stephenson family because she's pregnant? Hadwin Stephenson only said her baby is the future heir of the Stephenson family. He never said she would be the mistress of the Stephenson family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"In my opinion, the Stephenson family probably thinks she's low-born, so Hadwin Stephenson has no plans to marry her. Women like her are nothing more than baby-making machines for rich families."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not help frowning, and she felt her best friend beside her stiffen slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina!" she cried out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina turned her head and smiled at Grace. "I'm fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two women in the washroom seemed to hear the sound outside and immediately walked out. Their expressions changed when they saw Lina and Grace. They stammered an apology, saying, "I'm sorry... We... We were just talking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, they were just minor actresses in the film crew. Although they were jealous and disdainful of women who got to the top by using their children like Lina, they were scared to say it to her face. They were scared to death after getting caught. They were worried that Lina would complain to Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina smiled. "I had no idea people like you would be so worried about whether a woman like me marries my boyfriend or not. My boyfriend doesn't even think I'm not good enough for him, but it seems you think so.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two women grew even paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina raised her chin, her face full of confidence. "Whether Hadwin and I will get married doesn't concern you. I just don&rsquo;t want you to be humiliated when Hadwin and I really do get married!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two women left dejectedly. Lina turned and saw the worried look on her best friend's face. She said, "Alright, don't worry about me. I know how Hadwin and I are doing. I'm confident about our future!"</p></div>
