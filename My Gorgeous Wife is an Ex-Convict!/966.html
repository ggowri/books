        <h1>Chapter 965</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, next time I'll bring Nelson along so that you can meet him," Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing the phone call, Lina asked some of her friends and colleagues about the matter. Two colleagues happened to have relatives working in kindergartens. However, they turned her down when they learned that Nelson was a deaf child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reason they refused was that the child was different from a normal child, so the teachers would probably have a hard time managing him. Besides, he might not be able to mix well with the other kids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina discovered that it was more difficult for deaf children to get into a normal kindergarten even if they had hearing aids and could speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina and Hadwin were having dinner together after she got off work in the evening, Lina attentively poured drinks for Hadwin, added food to his bowl, and poured soup for him. Her actions only made Hadwin confused, and his beautiful eyes looked straight at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What's the matter?" His staring made her feel a little guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you do me wrong again?" asked Hadwin without beating around the bush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she might not understand the question if he beat around the bush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina almost choked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't do you wrong!" she said indignantly. 'Is that all I am in his eyes?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" He was skeptical. "Did you grab someone's clothes again? Or secretly bought some BL comics? Did you buy tickets to some male singer&rsquo;s concert and plan to go without me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin kept on asking while Lina sweated excessively. 'I've done&hellip; all of these before.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't you have any faith in me? Besides... I&rsquo;ve told you before... Uh, these male celebrities&hellip; I only have pure appreciation for them. I just appreciate them!" Her voice trailed off as she met his eyes. She then concluded quickly. "I'm sure it's not what you just said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why are you so attentive today?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't I be nicer to you?" She puffed out her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" He raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Alright, I give up.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I want to ask you for a favor!" Lina said rather lamely as she told Hadwin about Nelson&rsquo;s kindergarten issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That child is cute. It's just that he was born deaf. He now wears a hearing aid and can speak. But regular kindergartens refuse to admit him regardless. There's no need to put him in a special needs kindergarten as well. After all, he's just like any other kid now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at Hadwin with imploring eyes and said, &ldquo;You're well connected, aren't you? Do you know anyone working in kindergartens?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here I thought it's something difficult. It's just getting a kid into kindergarten. I'll take care of it for you later," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately smiled. Of course, she did not forget to say, "Don't choose an expensive one. A regular one will do. They can't afford expensive ones. Besides, when the kid starts going to kindergarten, the gap between rich and poor would be too wide. It&rsquo;ll only cause the kid some psychological problems."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin did not expect the seemingly careless girl to be so attentive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he would have preferred her being this attentive toward him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You care a lot about the boy," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's handsome and cute. Grace showed me a picture of him today. Wow, he's just so good-looking," said Lina.</p></div>
