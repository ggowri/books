        <h1>Chapter 2945</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, this is a difficult path, but she wants to believe that Brian Hart's feelings for her go far beyond liking. His reluctance to let her go and fear of her getting hurt... all these emotions will eventually turn into love for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving The Reed residence, Valda Theller called Brian Hart's phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller?" Brian Hart's voice came from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At the villa, why?" Brian Hart replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not on the side of your mansion?" Valda Theller was a little surprised. She thought he would be resting at the Hart family's estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I wanted some peace and quiet. If I rested at home, I probably wouldn't get any peace." Brian Hart said. Besides, his injury was not a big problem anymore. Apart from not being able to engage in strenuous exercise recently, not being able to lift heavy objects, and having to pay attention to his diet, everything else was no different from an ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... I want to come and see you, is that okay?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was silence on the other end of the phone. After a while, his voice came, "My injury is not a big deal anymore, and you don't need to come see me out of obligation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not coming to see you out of obligation, I have something to say to you." Valda Theller took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can say it over the phone." Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's say it in person." Valda Theller said, because saying it in person would be more solemn. She wanted him to understand her seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll send someone to pick you up." he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need, I'll come by myself. Wait for me!" Valda Theller said, and then quickly ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart looked down at his phone. What did she want to say to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that he had expectations, and in the end, it would only lead to disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a taxi and soon arrived at the entrance of Brian Hart's villa. When she pressed the doorbell, a servant came to open the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Theller, right? The young master is waiting for you inside. Please follow me." the servant said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller followed the servant and came into the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart was sitting on the sofa in the living room at the moment. When he saw her, he dismissed the servant and said, "Okay, you can say what you want to say to me now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a deep breath and looked at the person in front of her, "Do you... still think that if you were to fall in love with someone in this lifetime, that person can only be me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes narrowed slightly. What was she trying to say?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart slowly stood up and walked step by step towards Valda Theller. Could it be possible? The words she wanted to say to him today, could they be what he was thinking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart was beating faster, and even his breathing seemed to become more rapid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would he really not be disappointed? Sometimes, when expectations are too high, disappointment can become even more desperate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know what you're asking?" he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know." she said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his thin lips and after a while, he said hoarsely, "Yes, if I were to fall in love with someone in this lifetime, I think that person can only be you. What about you? Do you want me to fall in love with you? Or do you want to completely cut ties with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pitch-black eyes stared at her intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was anticipation, suppression, anxiety, and fear in those eyes... Was all of this because of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man actually likes her very much, doesn't he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She slowly raised her hand and stroked his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body stiffened, but he didn't avoid it. Instead, he let her hand gently stroke his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian Hart, how much do you really like me?" Valda Theller murmured, "If love is worth 100 points, how much do you like me? 95 points? 90 points? Or 80 points?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her, but didn't know how to answer. Even he himself was not sure how much he liked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her finger pressed against his lips, stopping him from saying what he was about to say.</p></div>
