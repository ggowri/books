        <h1>Chapter 1935</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina instantly felt her hands become empty, and her belly lost the warmth of his palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Lost... Am I just going to lose him like this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well, if you wanted to see me just to tell me all this, you can stop coming to look for me. You can contact my secretary if you need anything," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Contact your secretary?" Lina was confused for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can tell the secretary how much child support fee or money you want. I'm fine with it as long as it's not an astronomical amount. As for the baby in your belly, you can give birth or abort them. It&rsquo;s up to you," Hadwin Stephenson said without a trace of emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I'm not doing this for the money..." muttered Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Does it matter? To sum it up&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before Hadwin Stephenson could finish, Lina suddenly lunged forward, wrapped her arms around his neck, stood on his tiptoes, and kissed him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The sudden kiss made Hadwin Stephenson's body stiffen. He subconsciously wanted to stretch out his hands to push her away, but he suddenly stopped when he touched her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was no longer her usual self but a pregnant woman. Even a nudge from him could hurt her and the baby in her belly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pressed his thin lips together tightly, and his body was rigid as he passively accepted the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her lips were as soft as ever. When she kissed him like this, her faint scent penetrated his heart through the tip of his nose, making him want to indulge in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Don't let her get to you!' Hadwin Stephenson kept telling himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His hands by his sides were clenched into fists as if he could only suppress his impulse in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina seemed to want to put her longing and regrets into this kiss. She kissed hurriedly and eagerly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, his lips remained closed. They never opened. It was as if he was unwilling to forgive and accept her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want to lose him. She really did not want that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The tears in Lina's eyes came pouring out again, and the tip of her tongue struggled to enter his mouth. His lips were still tightly closed, not giving her a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina felt her heart sink. She thought he would have some feelings for her. She thought she had a chance, but now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is it like what he said? Have I already lost him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Tears ran down her cheeks, down the bridge of her nose, and onto her lips. They also fell on his lips through the gap in her lips.</p></div>
