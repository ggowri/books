        <h1>Chapter 2587</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis, we can go home without her," said Mason. His expression showed obvious resistance to Grace's offer to send them home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes dimmed slightly. She was not around when he grew up, so it was natural that he resisted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mason, I miss you so much. I want to send you home so that I can spend more time with you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mason was silent, and his beautiful eyes were indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if how much his mother missed him meant nothing to him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Veronica Barlow said, "Mason, let's ask aunt Cummins to take us home. I envy you that you have a mommy. My mommy..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Veronica Barlow's words disappeared in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to call her stepmother &lsquo;Mommy&rsquo; because that woman had never treated her sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She often thought of her mommy, thinking how happy she would be if she were alive. Her mommy could protect her if she got into any trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she was envious of Mason for having such a good mommy every time aunt Cummins visited Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you can have my mommy," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't just give away your mommy casually. You have a mommy, so cherish her, got it?" Veronica Barlow said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mason blinked. Although he understood the meaning of the word &lsquo;cherish&rsquo;, he did not understand why he should cherish his mommy. All he wanted to cherish was his sis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Mason no longer rejected Grace from sending them back since Veronica Barlow had said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the school was not far from the He family&rsquo;s house, Grace drove the two children to the apartment downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching the two children walk into the apartment building, Grace smiled. As she was about to turn around and return to the car, she heard Veronica Barlow behind her. "Mason, press the elevator button first. I'll come over after saying goodbye to aunt Cummins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around to see Veronica Barlow running toward her in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Grace asked. She had already said goodbye when she got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"aunt Cummins, I... I want to ask if you will take Mason back to the Reed family&rsquo;s house?" Veronica Barlow looked up and asked cautiously. It was as if she had summoned the courage to ask this question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the little girl in front of her, Grace hesitated slightly before saying, "I hope Mason can move back to the Reed family&rsquo;s house, and I'm working hard for it to happen. He has suffered a lot in the past. I hope to make up for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you're going to take Mason away, aren't you?" Veronica Barlow's eyes reddened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace patted the girl's head, not wanting to weave white lies to deceive the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Mason could not stay with the He family forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In particular, the He family&rsquo;s house itself was not conducive to the child's growth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won&rsquo;t be taking him away anytime soon. I'll let him get familiar with me, his father, and his siblings first. We'll take him back to the Reed family&rsquo;s house when he's willing to accept us. Even if he returns to the Reed family&rsquo;s house, you'll still be his sister. You can see each other at school every day, and I&rsquo;ll help you if you ever need help!"</p></div>
