        <h1>Chapter 379</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," She choked, but she did not know how else to get 50 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, Jason chuckled. "I don't want to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s body stiffened as a result, and all of a sudden, she looked like a deflated ball. Even the last gleam in her eyes disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, of course he would reject her. What made her think that if she stayed with him and granted him everything he asked, he would give her 50 million dollars?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed at herself. Was it because she had thought that she was worth that much or because she thought his interest in her was worth 50 million dollars?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her head in silence. Her hand that had been holding Jason's hand seemed to have lost all its strength as it let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked darkly at Grace and after a moment, stood up and said, "I think you'd better get some rest, Sis. I'll ask the servant to get you something to eat. Eat before you go to bed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Jason walked out of the room and Grace was left alone in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slowly, Grace&rsquo;s hands wrapped around herself, and sure enough... she was left alone once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that loneliness and helplessness could really chew up a person's soul. Even if she wanted to sell herself, it was not an easy task.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason went straight to the study and called Terrence, "Look up Grace's whereabouts today. What the hell made her so upset?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right," said Terrence. It took him only over an hour to sort things out before he called again to report everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They moved her grave?" Jason frowned a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Miss Cummins's father moved Miss Cummins's mother's grave a week ago. Miss Cummins went to pay her respects in vain today. The person in charge of the grave sweeping register of the village said that Miss Cummins was very emotional after learning that her mother's grave had been moved and still insisted on going up the hill. After coming down the hill, she hurried off with her electric bike..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence went on to inform Jason of Grace's visit to the Cummins family's house and the conversations she had with the neighbors. He also told him that Grace's call history that day included calls to her father and Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Records show that Miss Cummins later made a total of 38 calls to her family, but no one answered."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face darkened as he heard Terrence&rsquo;s report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By then, Jason could guess that the 50 million dollars was the price of knowing the whereabouts of her mother's grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was going to sell herself to him in exchange for the whereabouts of a grave?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman... Jason felt an indescribable feeling in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where is her mother buried now? Go and find out," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence acknowledged Jason&rsquo;s order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a knock came from the door of the study. A servant came to report that Grace would not eat anything and would not respond to whatever they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," Jason answered and began walking toward Grace's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he entered the room, he saw a plate of food on the short table. Nevertheless, the thin figure was still the same as when he had entered the room earlier.</p></div>
