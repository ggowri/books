        <h1>Chapter 3693</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Tina was still grumbling in the car, "Why did you pull me up so quickly? Today is Jasmine's birthday, and I wanted to go shopping with her a little longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's already so late, do you not fear danger while wandering around?" Chandler retorted impatiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we have you and Mason with us, how could we possibly be in danger?" Tina replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must be admitted that her flattery was quite good, at least for Chandler, it was effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler glanced at the person sitting next to him and suddenly asked, "What kind of manga did you lend to Jasmine? Yaoi?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina chuckled nervously, "Not entirely, I also gave her some manga that are very youthful, energetic, and positive, about striving hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such as?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such as..." She began to rack her brains, and finally managed to name a few manga books about sports.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasmine is still young, don't always give her those 'kinds' of manga. If you lead her astray in the future, see how your parents will deal with you," Chandler warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina grumbled, "The manga I read is not a big deal. My mom even watches them with </span><span>me and says the boys in them are handsome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." Chandler was speechless for a moment. It seems that he still needs to communicate with his future mother-in-law in the future. "Do you also like the love in those manga books?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" She was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The love between men, do you like it?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I like that kind of love, but it doesn't matter if it's between a man and a woman," Tina said. "I think as long as it's two people who truly love each other, age, gender, wealth, can all be overcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a dreamy expression of longing appeared on her face. At her age, she may not yet understand what true love is, but she has a naive yearning for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about you? Would you be willing to overcome everything for someone you love in the future?" Chandler asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me?" Tina blinked and turned to Chandler. "But in the future, I'm supposed to love you, Chandler. Do I need to overcome anything else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's heart suddenly shook. The car stopped at a red light, and his gaze fell on Tina. "You 'have' to love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?" she said. "You and I are engaged, and this engagement was arranged since I was born. You also saved my mother's life. Without you, both my mother and I might not be alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler felt a complex emotion rising in his chest. He hesitated for a moment and said, "Don't you feel uncomfortable? Because I saved you and your mother, your engagement has to be tied to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Tina shook her head. "I think it's great. I have a fianc&eacute; like you. My classmates envy me because you're handsome, a famous university student, rich, and talented... everything is perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler tightly pursed his lips. She felt good and didn't feel any sense of restraint because she hadn't truly fallen in love with him yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't fallen in love with him, she just saw him as a habitual presence, which was why she could say such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one day she fell in love with someone else, would she feel that he had used his life-saving act to force her into an engagement, binding her for life, and that it was a despicable act?</span></p></div>
