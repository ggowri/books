        <h1>Chapter 1920</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina quickly said, "No, that's not true! I was stupid. I'm the dumbest person in the world. Hadwin broke up with me to save me, not to get the Stephenson family! It took him five years to regain control of his life before he came to look for me, but I didn't believe anything he told me. He even had a blood curse on him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina hated how stubborn she was. She still loved Hadwin Stephenson but was held back by fear of being hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even the last time she got to his mansion, she believed that he and Katherine Jackson were still together and that he was only fooling around with her just because she saw Katherine Jackson coming out of his mansion. She did not even ask him for confirmation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Why couldn't I give him a little more trust? Why did I cling to the idea that he had little affection for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Blood curse? What blood curse?" Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney said with puzzled faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina told her parents what Katherine Jackson had said to her on the rooftop, Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney were stunned for quite some time. After a long while, Mr. Sweeney heaved a long sigh. "It seems that we've misunderstood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin has done so much for you." Mrs. Sweeney also sighed. Who would have thought that the man she thought was unfaithful and had failed her daughter loved her so much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, Dad, I... I want to see Hadwin after I get discharged from the hospital. I want to apologize to him and try to see if he still wants the baby and me." Lina hesitated a little when she got to the last half of what she had to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Will Hadwin... still want me after that falling out? Will he ever forgive me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was not even a shred of confidence in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, she had said she would not regret it when they had fallen out earlier, and his cold disappointed eyes seemed to be etched in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why won't he want you? The baby in your belly is his own flesh and blood!" Mr. Sweeney said immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina says bitterly, "Even... Even if he no longer has feelings for me, everything was my own doing.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney comforted her daughter, saying, "Alright, hold your thoughts on that. What matters most now is for you to stay in bed so you won&rsquo;t have a miscarriage. If you're in good health after you're discharged from the hospital, we'll accompany you to see Hadwin Stephenson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina also knew that what mattered most now was for her to do everything possible to avoid getting miscarrying. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, speaking of which, the baby has had a tough life. You've been in the hospital several times when you're only more than three months pregnant," Mrs. Sweeney said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina gently stroked her pregnant belly that was still not obvious. The baby managed to survive again and again. She only hoped that the baby would not go through so many hurdles after this and have a smooth future ahead. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After surviving a disaster, Lina soon fell asleep. Even so, her hands continued to rest on her belly although she was sleeping. It was as if inside her belly was her precious treasure and she would do anything to keep it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace opened her eyes again, she saw a white ceiling as well as a doctor and nurses clad in white. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Reed, you're awake," the doctor said.</p></div>
