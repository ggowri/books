        <h1>Chapter 3099</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla paused for a moment, then seemed to understand something and let out a soft sigh. "Valda, don't do something you'll regret. Sometimes, if you miss something, it may take even longer to get it back. Just like me and Martin... because of a regretful decision, even though we love each other, after all these years of ups and downs, we can't necessarily say the word 'happiness'. Valda, are you willing to give up the happiness that is within reach?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Valda hesitated for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sometimes, don't jump to conclusions or make decisions too quickly. Relationships involve two people, so decisions should also be made together. If you make a wrong decision on your own, you may end up regretting it like I did." Kyla spoke earnestly, hoping that Valda wouldn't become another version of herself when it comes to matters of the heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the kitchen, Martin looked at Brian and said, "Valda's back, why do you look like you're not in a good mood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian replied self-deprecatingly, "Have you ever loved someone who unfortunately didn't love you back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have," Martin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now it was Brian's turn to look at Martin in surprise. "Was it Kyla?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who else could it be?" Martin replied. "So now Valda doesn't believe that you love her either?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two men looked at each other in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you remember what you once said to me?" Martin suddenly asked. "You said that even if a relationship is painful, you wouldn't choose to forget it easily, but would rather remember it forever. So now, if Valda continues to not believe you, what are you going to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll keep trying until she believes me," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The process might be very difficult," Martin warned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if it's difficult, it's nothing compared to what she's done for me," Brian said, looking past the kitchen's glass door at Valda, who was talking to Kyla in the living room. "When Valda was washed away by the water, I realized that I couldn't bear to lose her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a pause, he continued, "Emotions are what make us human. Without them, we are just empty shells, not knowing the purpose of our existence. I remember my feelings for Valda. At least with her, my life had a purpose. But if I were to forget her, my life would be nothing but a miserable existence, worse than it is now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" murmured Martin, his gaze also turning towards Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, is he now just a walking corpse? Once hypnotized, he buried his feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even now, he understands that he has fallen in love with her once again, but does he need to remember the past feelings? Whenever he gets close to her, he feels like a part of his feelings for her is missing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, on small matters, she would say a certain phrase without him understanding it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that it was their past together. But now, she was the only one who remembered it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, Kyla put her youngest daughter to bed and then went to check on her son Nelson in his room. She made sure he wasn't kicking off his blankets before returning to her own room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she entered the room, she saw Martin sitting on the sofa, flipping through a photo album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is... her and her child's photo album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The album mainly contains photos of her and Nelson taken during the time when she was released from prison but had not yet been found by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What made you suddenly start looking at photos?" Kyla approached and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After looking at these photos, I realized that I hardly have any pictures of you," said Martin.</p></div>
