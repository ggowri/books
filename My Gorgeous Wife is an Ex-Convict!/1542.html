        <h1>Chapter 1540</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, it'll ease the trigger and make it harder for you to recover your memories," said Dr. Guzman. He had also said the same thing when he first prescribed this medicine to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, to his surprise, the man gave a very different answer this time. "Then there's no need for a prescription."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Reed?" Dr. Guzman was surprised. 'No prescription? Is he planning to... "Do you want to... recover your memories?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, I've forgotten them long enough. It's time I restore them," Jason said thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But in that case, the pain may be too great for you. If anything happens, perhaps..." Dr. Guzman paused before he continued saying, "After all, the human body has a certain capacity it can take. It's hard to predict what will happen once the limit is exceeded."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Young master Reed was different from ordinary patients who wanted to recover their memories. Ordinary patients rarely experienced such pain. If anything went wrong while he was trying to recover his memories, the consequences could be disastrous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what?" Jason raised the corners of his lips as if he was smiling faintly, but his eyes were grim. "Then let's see whether the pain of restoring my memory is stronger or whether my body can endure it better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Guzman was stunned. The man before him held Emerald City in his palm. Should anything happen to him, it would be enough to change everything in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, this influential figure seemed to be putting his life on the line just to recover his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The man had casually said to him more than four years ago, "Then I'll just take the medicine. It doesn't matter if I don't recover my memory."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it because of Mrs. Reed, who has risen from the dead and returned to the Reed family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it possible? Is he willing to risk his life to regain his memories for a woman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Dr. Guzman could only bury the question at the bottom of his heart as he dared not ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It took Grace a while to get the two little ones to decide who was older and who was younger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the end, Mick was the older brother, while Jasper was the younger sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Of course, the birth order was ultimately determined by height. The children finally compared their heights and Jasper narrowly lost by one centimeter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, can't I be the older sister?" Jasper said, unwilling to give up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Isn't it great to be a younger sister? You have a brother to protect you." Grace looked at her son as she spoke. "Mick, you'll protect Jasper, won't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed was silent. 'Protect my sister...' He preferred being alone. Besides, no one had ever asked him to protect anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Protecting his sister also sounded like a lot of trouble. If his sister was stupid, it would be very tiring to protect an idiot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when he thought of the title &lsquo;brother&rsquo;, the little one struggled for a moment and nodded. He did not want to be a younger brother no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, Jasper has a brother to protect her from now on," Grace said with a smile and touched her son's head. "I think Mick will be a good brother in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed's peach blossom eyes that were similar to Jason's blinked. 'Will I be a good brother?'</p></div>
