        <h1>Chapter 3432</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like that ointment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, as Veronica looked at Mason in front of her, she suddenly felt a heavy feeling in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moonlight shines through the window and onto his handsome face. He doesn't show any expression, but the way he looks at her makes her feel like a pitiful puppy, gazing at its owner with pleading eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh my goodness, what is she thinking! Veronica quickly shook her head. Anyway, Mason wouldn't be an abandoned puppy, and she certainly wasn't his owner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not angry," said Veronica, she just didn't know how to face him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She finished speaking, poured a glass of water from the water dispenser, and after drinking it, she said to him, "It's already very late now, you should go to bed early and stop squatting outside my room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, she walked back to her room, but Grace followed closely behind her all the way to the door of her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica turned around and looked at Mason with a hint of helplessness. His behavior made it difficult for her to close the door!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I feel like even if she closes the door, he will still continue to squat outside her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sighed and asked, "What exactly do you still want to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can I apologize?" he murmured softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback, clearly not expecting to hear such words from his mouth, "You want...an apology?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I apologize, can we go back to how things were before? Will you still talk to me every day like you used to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, she's not talking to him, which makes him feel like every minute and every second is becoming particularly unbearable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's heart softened, "Mason, what I want is not your apology. I just hope that you can also respect me, instead of using force just because you don't like something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyelashes trembled slightly and the gleam in his eyes flickered. "Okay, I will respect your wishes. From now on, I won't use forceful methods anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" She was surprised that he gave in so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, really," Mason said. "So, can we go back to how things were before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at him and smiled slightly. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them seemed to have reconciled, "Okay, it's late. You should go back to your room and sleep," she urged him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can I sleep in your room tonight?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" She looked hesitant, after all, they were not children anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm afraid you'll ignore me again tomorrow morning," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't," she promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, then let me stay outside your room, I won't be able to sleep in my own room anyway," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hesitated for a moment before finally saying, "Okay...just for tonight. Tomorrow, you need to go back to your own room and sleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Mason agreed readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica then let Mason into her room, and the two of them lay on the bed together like they used to when they were kids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's room was not small, and the bed was also a 1.8-meter bed, so even with two people lying on it, it was quite spacious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Mason still snuggled up to Veronica, his body slightly curled up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body language was like he was trusting her with all his heart, which made her feel a sense of nostalgia and emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about it, many people change as they grow up, but he is the only one she knows who hasn't changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He still sticks to her like he did when they were kids, and when expressing his emotions, he is still as direct as ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt that he didn't respect her when he casually threw away and crushed the ointment Daniel gave her, but from another perspective, wasn't it also his way of expressing his emotions directly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In front of her, he never hides his emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she, who could accept it when they were kids, can't accept it now, so...actually, she's the one who has changed!</p></div>
