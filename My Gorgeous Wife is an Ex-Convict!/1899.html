        <h1>Chapter 1897</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll look into it," Terrence said immediately. Grace called him again just as he turned to leave to look into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you know where Jay is now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence looked at Grace with some hesitation and said, "Young Madam, Young master Reed is probably still angry right now. Besides, you mentioned Young master Reed's memory problem just now. Why don't you see Young master Reed after his anger cools down in a few days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just tell me where he is," Grace said insistently. In other words, she had no intention of leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young master Reed is truly furious this time. After you drove onto the freeway the other day, Young master Reed vomited blood right away," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was shocked. "What did you say? He vomited blood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, he vomited blood. It just came out and then Young master Reed's blood was all over my clothes. Young master Reed looked at the back of your car with a desperation I've never seen before," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's nose felt sore, and her eyes watered again. She had no idea. She had no idea about it. Even when she finally saw him again, he did not tell her anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&ldquo;Then what happened? Did you take him to the hospital afterward? Is he okay?" Grace asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He's okay. The doctor just said Young master Reed was suffering from pent-up frustrations and ordered him to rest well," Terrence said and sighed. "After you fell into the sea, Young master Reed almost lost his mind. When you finally came back, I thought you and Young master Reed could be happy. I didn't expect it to turn out this way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence was not only saying this as Jason's subordinate but as a friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know it's my fault that I hurt him to save Mrs. Watts," Grace said with remorse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Perhaps Young master Reed's mother used to be the one who could severely hurt him, but you're the only one with that power now. Young master Reed... can't afford to get hurt again!" Terrence paused, and his expression became stern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I won't hurt him again! I definitely won't!" Grace said with determination in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The look in her eyes reminded Terrence of how she had resolutely pulled the handbrake on the edge of the cliff and fallen into the sea. Back then, she had also looked so determined. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she had not done that, there would have been no chance of reuniting. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young master Reed is in Splashes of Blood," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. 'Splashes of Blood?' She remembered it to be the room that enshrined the rusty iron sword that was covered with blood, as well as the place where Jay's great-grandmother killed his great-grandfather!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Jay... went there. Is he...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you!" said Grace. She turned and ran toward Splashes of Blood according to her memory of where it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence looked at Grace's back and murmured, "But she's the only one who can heal Young master Reed. There's no way Young master Reed can get over her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If Young master Reed could get over her, he would have gotten over her five years ago instead of almost dying!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But what's with... Young master Reed's memory? Why did Young master Reed say he has recovered his memory but it isn't as what actually happened?' Terrence froze as he began investigating it.</p></div>
