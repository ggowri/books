        <h1>Chapter 1688</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Damian Harmon froze. "You're a lawyer, so I can't win an argument with you. But I have evidence that you and your mentor are in an illicit relationship!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon took a handful of photos straight out of his arms and scattered them as he spoke. These photos were photos of Grace and Lawyer Kang behaving intimately. As these photos were scattered on the floor, many people around them picked them up to take a look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The way they looked at Grace changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was secretly smug as she looked at the photos in front of her. 'So what if they realize they were photoshopped afterward? Who would believe it after the rumors have already spread? They would just think that the Reed family was deliberately covering up the truth and lying about the photos being photoshopped.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch squatted down and picked up a photo. After taking a look at it, she looked up and asked Irene Lynch, "Mommy, is Jasper Reed's mommy a bad woman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There seemed to be elation in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Children would not hide their emotions the way adults did. Oriel Lynch just thought that if Jasper Reed's mother was a bad woman, Jasper would also be a bad girl. Then, Mr. Reed would not like them and would like her even more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's expression changed. She figured out what Damian Harmon was up to after seeing these photos!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The best way to deal with it was to confront it head-on rather than delay it. The longer she delayed it, the worse it would get!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before Grace could refute, Jason had already walked up to Damian Harmon. He said with a grim face, "I seem to have underestimated you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, he ordered his men," Detain him and collect these photos. No one here is allowed to take one back. Call the police and let them take care of it. Find Emerald City's top computer experts, photoshop experts, and the police to check these photos!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said domineeringly. His solution was also what Grace had thought of&mdash;solve it on-site!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was the only way they could quash these rumors!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon was dumbstruck. He did not expect Jason to deal with it like this! 'Isn't he supposed to freak out after seeing these photos and then get his hands on me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once they laid a hand on him, he would have more reason to say they were so mad because these photos were real!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... it was quite different from what he had imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon said quickly, "Mr. Reed, it took me a lot of effort to find all this evidence. I did it for your own good. Grace cheated on you. No man can tolerate&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before he could finish, a loud slap rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon's face had been slapped sideways. The teeth in his mouth seemed to have come loose, and his cheek was burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who are you to talk about my wife like that? No man can tolerate anyone talking about his wife like that!" Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon wanted to cry but had no tears. Well, Jason did hit him, but it was not the same as he had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon could not help looking in Irene Lynch's direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was on the verge of crushing her teeth from grinding them so hard. She had no idea Jason was going to verify the photos on the spot and make such a scene.</p></div>
