        <h1>Chapter 3234</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Kyla was still hesitating, Martin said, "Let's just take a look."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If we're just taking a photo..." Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what? Since I can afford it, why not choose something you're satisfied with?" Martin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she looked at the more exquisite and luxurious dresses, Kyla felt even more dazzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her gaze stopped on a very simple wedding dress, a pure white wedding dress with no decorations, but the flowing cut gave a sense of elegance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of wedding dress had a feeling of returning to simplicity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to try this one," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," the staff responded, bringing a sample for Kyla to try on and introducing the designer of the dress, a rising star in the industry who was highly regarded despite not being well-known yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you think it's too plain?" Martin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think it's great, simple and just like life, which is actually best when it's simple." Kyla said. "If you don't like it, I can change into another one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, as long as you like it." Martin replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla went into the dressing room to change into her wedding dress, while Martin waited outside on the sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To him, at this age, after being together with Kyla for so many years and living together for the past few years, they could be considered an old married couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at this moment, while waiting for her to come out, he suddenly felt nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was like a young man waiting for his bride to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin suddenly laughed, realizing that he was no longer a young man, yet he still had this nervous feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, there was movement from the dressing room. When the curtain was pulled back and Kyla walked towards him, Martin's eyes were filled with amazement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pure white wedding dress on her was so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he understood why he had been nervous earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of this painting, he was late to see it for too many years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If back then, he didn't mistake the person who saved him, and if back then, he was willing to let go of his desire for revenge for the sake of loving her, then perhaps there wouldn't have been so many obstacles between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he had already seen her in her wedding dress!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you think, is it good-looking?" Kyla walked over and asked, but her voice suddenly stopped short because Martin's eyes were now red and misty, as if covered with a layer of fog.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this way, it's almost like wanting to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with you?" she asked, "Your eyes are so red, is it because they're uncomfortable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I'm fine," he said, looking a bit embarrassed as he closed his eyes and tried to calm his emotions. After a moment, he slowly opened his eyes and said to her, "You look very beautiful in that wedding dress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That one will do." Kyla said to the staff member next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, but customizing a wedding dress will take one month," said the staff member.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, Kyla arranged a specific time with the staff to take the photos. After leaving the store, Kyla turned to Martin and asked, "Do you have anything else to do today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I've already scheduled today's work for the day after tomorrow," said Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well... let's go watch a movie. It's been a long time since we watched one," she suggested. Come to think of it, the last time they watched a movie together was over two years ago, and it was to say goodbye to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now... it's not the same anymore!</p></div>
