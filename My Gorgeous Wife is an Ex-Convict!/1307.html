        <h1>Chapter 1306</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What came over me just now? I can't believe I fell into a trance just by looking at Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace said, "Sorry, I entered the wrong private room." She was about to close the door of the private room and leave as she spoke, but someone had already gotten up from their seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They looked at her mockingly and said, "Hey, did you really enter the wrong private room or did you know that Young Master Stevens was here so you were looking for a chance to appear before him? Grace, I heard you got out of prison, but I didn't expect you to chase after Young Master Stevens so desperately!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rest burst into laughter after hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did she not look at herself in the mirror? She's an ex-convict. How dare she show up in front of Sean?!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know, right? Sean and Lily are engaged now and they're getting married soon. Why is she so shameless?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, Grace. You killed Lily's sister back then. What's the matter? Do you want to destroy Lily's marriage and be the mistress now? However, Sean probably won't even look at you even if you stand naked in front of him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked coldly at the people in front of her. Obviously, none of them were well informed enough to know that her case had been reversed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Sean and Lily should surely know about it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A hint of doubt flashed in Grace's eyes. She did not know that Sean and Lily had suffered a lot from Jason because of her. Naturally, they would not mention much about Grace's case in front of these people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only some people in the legal industry knew about Grace's case reversal. Not many people knew about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said coldly, "I can sue you for slander and insult for saying these things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure. Sue me if you can!" The man who spoke at the beginning now walked over to Grace, trying to please Lily and Sean. "Why don't you kneel and apologize to Lily here and see if Lily is willing to forgive you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He tried to put his hand on Grace's shoulder, but before his hand could reach, the bodyguard following Grace grabbed his hand violently and twisted his hand to his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aargh!" the man immediately shrieked like a pig being slaughtered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean immediately got up. "Grace, what are you doing? Hurry and ask your friend to release him. Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean thought the bodyguard beside Grace was her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said lightly, "I told you. I accidentally entered the wrong private room, but I'll have the material ready to sue for slander and insult."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Sean was visibly furious. "Grace, are you here for trouble? They wouldn&rsquo;t have said that if you had not deliberately appeared before me in such a clumsy manner. Do you dare say that you didn't show up in front of me on purpose?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean only thought Grace was looking for a chance to approach him. After all, he heard that Jason seemed to have dumped Grace, and he had not seen Grace around Jason for some time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was almost amused by Sean's imagination. "I didn't show up in front of you on purpose. Lily would take a fancy to a man like you, but not me!" she said in disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean and Lily's expressions changed on the spot as soon as she said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily said, "Grace, I know you held a grudge when you broke up with Sean, but Sean loves me. As for you, even if you didn't kill my sister and you've reversed your case, it's still impossible between Sean and you!"</p></div>
