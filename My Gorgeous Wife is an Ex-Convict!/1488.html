        <h1>Chapter 1487</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you believe me, remove those people and just let Huang Qian follow me to protect me like before. You don&rsquo;t have to get so many people to follow me every time I go out.&rdquo; It made her feel like she was being monitored by a lot of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No." He rejected her immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"In any case, you need to have a lot of people around you to protect you,&rdquo; Jason said in a deep voice. He did not want to tell her about Secretary Wang or Lily's escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, some of it was just his speculation. He was still unsure whether it was true. She was due to have a cesarean section in a week, and he was afraid it would be bad for her health if she got worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A sudden feeling of disappointment struck Grace's heart. He kept saying he believed her, but... he still did not believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jason, is there so little trust between us? What do I have to do for you to believe that I won't leave you?" she asked, unconsciously raising her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her. Those eyes almost seemed to see through her. "Then kiss me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What?" She was stunned and was a little at a loss all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kiss me. I'll believe you won't leave me if you kiss me." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Just give me some confidence so I can firmly believe that you really love me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It seemed that his love for her was deepening, yet it felt as though he was the only one growing attached to her in this relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She only married him because of the kids and Lina. Later, she was willing to love him again because she wanted to give the children a complete and happy family. Even when she said she would forgive him, he could not help wondering if it was also for the children?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Did she forgive him just so the children could have a complete family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Was that why she said she would forgive him but her body still resisted him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stared blankly at Jason and took a long time to digest what he had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did he just ask me to... kiss him? But I simply can't touch him.' Whenever she touched him, her body would almost instinctively stiffen and she would even... feel nauseous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her silence made him laugh mockingly at himself. "You can't do it, right? I'll remove those people when you can do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was about to turn away as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wait!" she said suddenly as she subconsciously reached out to grab him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not want him to just walk away like this. It made her feel that there might be a misunderstanding between them if she just let him leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not want any misunderstandings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You'll believe me if I kiss you, right?" She grabbed his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Instantly, her body stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Never mind. It's alright. I&rsquo;ll forget about the past. The man before me isn't the Master Reed who ignored me back then; he&rsquo;s Jay, the man who loves me deeply!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace kept telling herself as she kept her hand on Jason's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a slight look of surprise on Jason&rsquo;s face. Out of the corners of his eyes, he glanced at the hand holding his arm. Moments later, the word &lsquo;yes&rsquo; was gently uttered from his thin lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace took a deep breath, took a step forward, and put her hands around Jason's neck.</p></div>
