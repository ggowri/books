        <h1>Chapter 1498</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, she wished that he loved her less. This way, he would be less sad as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she could, she wanted to live till they were gray and old with him. She wanted to watch the three children be born into this world. Yet, that day would never come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once, she had said she would never leave his side. If he did not leave her, she would not leave either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Today, she went back on her promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The moment she released the handbrake, she had flashbacks of the conversation she had with Old Master Reed. She had wanted to bet with the old master to see how much she loved Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The bet made was not only between Jay and the old master but she was also involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The old master wanted to bet if she would give her life for Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Thus, this was how she ended up with one hand tied to the handbrake so that they could see what decision she would make.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All Grace heard was Jason&rsquo;s final shouts, and then, everything became painful as intense ocean water gushed into her mouth and nose. It was slowly making her suffocate...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Grace! Grace! &ldquo;Jasonn rushed toward the cliff. He wanted to jump into the ocean together with Grace&rsquo;s car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence tightly gripped Jason, fearing that Jason would do something stupid. The other bodyguards rushed over as well to hold him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Let go of me, I want to save Grace! Let go of me!&rdquo; Jason wildly shouted with red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Master Reed, there&rsquo;s no way Young Madam can be saved. She fell in with the car. If you jump, you&rsquo;ll lose your life as well. Young Madam wants you to keep living! &ldquo; Terrence said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason froze. Keep living&hellip; without her? What more was his life worth now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, the voice recording function from the device that defused the bombs sounded another recording. It was Old Master Reed&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Jay... I don&rsquo;t know what the end result was, whether it was the woman not being worth the sacrifice, or&hellip; this woman watched you be bombed to death for the sake of her own survival.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason lifelessly turned around and looked toward the device.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed&rsquo;s voice continued, &ldquo;No matter which it was, it would end the same. The woman would die. Once the countdown finished, the bombs would explode unless that woman pulled down on the handbrake. That was the only way to defuse it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everyone was stunned after hearing what the old master said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was just as what had transpired. Grace, along with the car, had fallen into the ocean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It meant that from the start, the old master had never intended to let Grace get out of this alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason went into a state of rage and shouted, &ldquo;Arghhh!&rdquo; He had gone mad from anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence and the rest tried to hold him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang, who was nearby, had a complicated look on his face after witnessing everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed&hellip; Even though he had miscalculated, the bombs did not explode! The old master lost the bet, and Grace indeed loved the young master. She had willingly given her life for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The old master had never trusted a woman his whole life, but if he was witnessing all of this, what would he think?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The old master set this up before his death as he wanted Grace dead. He merely hoped that with such a set-up, Jason could see the woman cravenly cling to life while fearing death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This way, even if Grace died, the young master would not feel as sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace&rsquo;s actions were unexpected.</p></div>
