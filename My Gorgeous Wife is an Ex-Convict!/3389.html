        <h1>Chapter 3387</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As far as he knew, there were several families in the Crypt who hoped to marry into the Quentin family. Some of them had even prepared girls of similar age to Lornell, with the intention of sending them to the Quentin family in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, Lornell's actions have undoubtedly disrupted the plans of many families.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Three hours later, Lornell looked at the person who appeared in front of him with a clearly surprised expression on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought he was waiting for one of the old monsters of the Quentin family, but he didn't expect to wait for his own father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How...did you come here?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just got back from a conference in another city and heard that you're engaged to the Hart family's daughter, so I came to see for myself," said Samir. "Do you really want to save her that badly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell pursed her lips tightly and stared straight at her father. After a while, she finally spoke one word, "Want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Samir Quentin said, "Alright, I'll save them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really think you can save her?" Lornell seemed somewhat incredulous. In his memory, his father only saved people who were beneficial to the Quentin family, those who could bring advantages to them. As for those who had no beneficial relationship with the Quentin family, his father wouldn't even spare them a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person was so sick that they were almost dying, but the father remained indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, the father wants to save Harley?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you have chosen her, I will save her once," said Samir. "I have already reviewed all the information you sent earlier. If we want to save her, we must perform the surgery immediately."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Surgery?" The attending physician was startled and said to Samir, "But she can't have surgery now. Harley is only 3 years old and has a blood clot in her brain, but it's not very large. If we operate on her now, she might not survive the surgery..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor didn't finish what he was saying, but everyone understood what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In my eyes, there are no 'ifs'." said Samir, and this statement was incredibly assertive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a doctor, it is rare to say that any surgery is 100% guaranteed because there is always a risk once the patient is on the operating table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Samir dares to say such words, causing the attending physician to widen their eyes and look at him in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get ready for surgery, the patient cannot be moved to the outside hospital, so I will perform the surgery here," Samir said to the attending physician. "Later, I will have my team come over here. As long as your hospital prepares the operating room for me, it will be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The attending physician looked at Samir and then at the Hart family, feeling uncertain about what decision to make.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at Samir, knowing that Lornell was the heir of the Quentin family. So, is this man in front of him the current head of the Quentin family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Quentin family and the Crypt family, even though he had heard of them before, he had never actually met them until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you really help my daughter wake up?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I believe there is no one I cannot save, as long as that person is still alive!" said Samir with a confident and determined expression on his handsome face.</p></div>
