        <h1>Chapter 4271 Seeking help from the Quentin family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele didn't say anything else because she understood that at this point, there was no way to salvage their already-ended marriage</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can Chandler really lure out the </span><span>gu</span><span>?" she asked, worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will go to the Quentin family again," Mr. Hunter</span><span>, who was silent just now,</span><span> suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Quentin family?" Colin was surprised. "But the Quentin family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like the Hunter family, the Quentin family </span><span>kept a low profile</span><span>. However, due to Chandler's connection with Tina, the Hunter family gradually started to make appearances. On the other hand, the Quentin family remained even more mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Quentin family excelled in medicine and possessed many secret techniques that were not widely known. Even in this era of advanced medicine, the Quentin family still held a special position among the Crypt families, indicating the extent of their medical prowess</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relationship between the Quentin family and the Hunter family in the Crypt family was not good, but it wasn't bad either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, convincing the Quentin family to help Chandler lure out the </span><span>gu</span><span> wouldn't be an easy task. Even if the old Mr. Hunter personally intervened, given the Quentin family's eccentric temperament, they might not agree to help</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if the Quentin family refuses?" Colin expressed his concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will offer conditions that the Quentin family would be willing to accept," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Colin couldn't help but be taken aback. It seemed that obtaining the Quentin family's agreement would require a considerable price to be paid</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, to save Chandler's life, they had no other choice</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I will accompany you to the Quentin family," Colin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I can go by myself!" the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, whether Chandler could be saved might depend on the Quentin family</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina learned from her parents about the compensation terms proposed by the Hunter family for their divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised her was that her parents had agreed to all of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina explained, "Quinn will spend </span><span>four months</span><span> with the Hunter family when she grows up. </span><span>I </span><span>know that you won't bear to be separated from your daughter, but the conditions proposed by the Hunter family are not harsh! And..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I understand!" Tina said. "I just didn't expect that my divorce would cause such a loss for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just money," Hadwin said. "We're doing all this just to truly live happily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Tina didn't feel happy. When Chandler signed the divorce agreement, it felt like a piece of her heart was also empty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was already a month later when she saw Chandler again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Hart family's banquet, Tina saw Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Stephenson family, the Hunter family, and the Hart family all </span><span>had </span><span>a good relationship, as they </span><span>were </span><span>familiar with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Tina returned to Emerald City, the Hart family visited her several times. Despite losing her memory, Tina got along well with Harley and felt like she was a lovely sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today </span><span>was </span><span>Harley's birthday, so the Hart family naturally invited relatives and friends to celebrate. It</span><span> wasn&rsquo;t</span><span> strange for Tina to see Chandler here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her surprise</span><span>, Chandler today </span><span>looked </span><span>thinner than the last time she saw him, with a paler complexion. He </span><span>appeared </span><span>somewhat sickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't he only tired and not seriously ill when he was hospitalized last time? So why </span><span>did </span><span>he look like this now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder.</span></p></div>
