        <h1>Chapter 3789</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart suddenly sank... Break up?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, Daniel had talked about breaking up with her, and at that time, she thought she was in a lot of pain! But now, compared to the present, that pain was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the two words "break up", spoken from Mason's mouth, made her feel unbearable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why... why do we have to break up?" Her lips trembled, as if she was asking with all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I'm tired." He said, not wanting to have emotional ups and downs or suffer from pain and discomfort because of her, nor did he want to experience hypnosis for the second time because of her in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might be best to cut off his feelings for her before he gets worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're breaking up. You can say whatever reason if someone asks. We won't see each other again, and I won't contact you either, so you don't need to find me." He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at him blankly, all her reactions seemed to have become extremely slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is he saying? Break up?! They haven't been together for long, everything was fine before, wasn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They ate together, shopped together, watched TV together in her apartment, and even lay in bed together, cuddling each other. Everything was so beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because she asked him to stop hitting Daniel today and waited aside while the medical staff treated Daniel, he wanted to break up with her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mason turned to leave, Veronica panicked and instinctively caught up with him, grabbing his sleeve. "Don't... don't go, I... I don't want to break up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused and turned to look at her. "I don't want to continue anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? I... I've explained to you, I have no feelings for Daniel, I care about you. Everything I did in the hospital was for you, not for Daniel. I was worried that Daniel would accuse you! Do you want me to explain again? Do we have to break up just because of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said you don't need to explain anymore." When she repeatedly mentioned the hospital incident, he felt an indescribable sense of unease. He couldn't even explain what this unease was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This terrible feeling was like drowning him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the few hours since they separated, the hypnotized memories of their relationship kept flashing through his mind like a slide show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he no longer had the same feelings as before, the memory of him at that time was so miserable, so painful, and so desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, if he continued with her, what about the future? If something like this happened again and she defended someone else, what would he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was afraid, afraid of experiencing it again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps this is the source of that unease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you believe my explanation now? Do you believe that I only love you?" Veronica looked at Mason with pleading eyes.</span></p></div>
