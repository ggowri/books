        <h1>Chapter 1140</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Stella with a half-smile. She did not think Stella was upset at all. She was more than 90% sure that Stella had something to do with the lounge incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However&hellip; no one knew what the police had found in their investigation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian got up and walked over. He looked at Grace and said, "I also got a call from the police. No matter who they wanted to harm, once they find out who drugged that man and who locked the lounge door, I'll make them pay the price and give you justice!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up at him. 'He knows I'm suspicious of Stella, so is he telling me that if it really is Stella who did it, he&rsquo;ll never cover for her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella shuddered, and there was a flash of envy in her eyes when she heard what Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does Brian really care that much about Grace that he can't bear to see Grace being wronged just a little? Grace wasn&rsquo;t even hurt at all. She just got a few scratches on her arm.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police said, "Alright, let's get into the room. There's something I want to explain to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Robert Brewer's family also entered the room with them. After all, Robert Brewer was considered a victim in this case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The family members who came today were Robert Brewer's parents, who were also Stella's former in-laws.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their eyes had never left Stella since they entered the police station. Seeing their former daughter-in-law dressing like a million bucks and their son, who was still lying in the hospital, both of them had an indescribable feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in town said that their former daughter-in-law had snagged the crown prince of the entertainment industry and was going to be the young madam of the Hart family. However, now it seemed that the crown prince was nicer to Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several people sat down in the room, and the police told them about their findings as they played some surveillance footage for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the police said there were two surveillance cameras installed near the lounge&rsquo;s entrance, Stella was stunned. She immediately turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Two?' She remembered it was one. Moreover, she had done some research in secret. The surveillance camera only captured the upper part of the lounge&rsquo;s door, and it was mainly facing the escalator to the second floor. The lounge was just a passing shot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she had specifically told the cleaner she bribed to bend over when locking and unlocking the door so that the camera could not capture her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now, the police were saying there was another camera?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on here? Did... the other camera capture the cleaner who locked the door? So if the police find this cleaner and track me according to the clues, I'll&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was covered in a cold sweat at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when the screen in the room showed a fast-forwarded footage of the surveillance, they discovered that one of the footage, as Stella had already known, filmed only the upper part of the lounge&rsquo;s door and not the lower part.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the other surveillance camera... It filmed a corner next to the lounge&rsquo;s door!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was stunned, and she stared blankly at the surveillance footage. 'How could this be? How could the surveillance camera be pointed at a corner? What's the point of monitoring a corner no one would go?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police pointed to the surveillance footage aimed at the corner and said, "The camera was supposed to show the lounge&rsquo;s door, but someone moved it. The time they moved it was at 4:12 p.m."</p></div>
