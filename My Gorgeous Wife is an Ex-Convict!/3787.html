        <h1>Chapter 3785</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica saw the situation getting worse and immediately rushed forward, risking danger to hug Mason's waist. His fist grazed her cheek, causing her great pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could almost sense that her face was now swollen and red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it, Mason, just stop it!" She shouted with all her might. "Do you really think money can solve everything?" Even if he could get away with it, the blood on his </span><span>hands from potentially crippling Daniel would never wash away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you choose to protect this guy?" His actions finally stopped, and his eyes stared straight at her like sharp swords, causing her pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...today, Daniel just brought me to see his hospitalized mother. He...didn't do anything extreme to me. You don't need to do this." Of course, if you ignore the fact that she was forcibly brought here, Daniel really didn't do anything to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her words were like adding fuel to the fire, making his face terrifyingly dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think what I did wasn't necessary...fine, I understand." Mason finally let go of Daniel and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Veronica stepped forward and grabbed his hand. "Don't go, wait for me. I'll call the medical staff to bandage and stop the bleeding for Daniel. You, wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her. "Since you put Daniel first, why should I wait for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said this and suddenly pulled his hand away from hers, then left without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica wanted to chase after Mason, but at this moment, Daniel was lying limp on the ground, eyes closed as if he had passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know how serious Daniel's injuries were!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica gritted her teeth and ran in the opposite direction of the elevator to find medical staff. After all, Daniel's injuries were more important right now. If something really happened to Daniel, Mason would be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the misunderstanding between Mason and her, as long as she explains it to him properly afterwards, everything should be fine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is what Veronica was thinking at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Daniel had 5 stitches on his head, a slight concussion, and many bruises, but fortunately, there were no fractures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he still had to stay in the hospital for a few more days of observation, according to the doctor, there shouldn't be any major problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lying on the hospital bed, Daniel said to Veronica, "You saw it too, Mason is a lunatic who doesn't value human life. And now, he has injured me like this. He probably just wants to throw some money at me and call it even."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hadn't brought me here without my consent in the first place, why would he have attacked you? Daniel, you were the one who made the mistake in the beginning!" Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was full of anger, "At this point, you still want to speak up for him?"</span></p></div>
