        <h1>Chapter 1704</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace responded and went to get the prescription filled with the rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was just a couple of ointments and a spray to relieve the pain and heal the bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace handed the medicine to the little girl. "Here, this is Mason's medicine. You need to apply it several times a day. The instructions are on the box. Do you know how to read these words?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes!" said Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then remember to apply this medicine to Mason&rsquo;s bruises every day," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That&rsquo;s no trouble at all! Mason is my brother!" Veronica Barlow put the medicine into her crossbody pouch and pulled out several crumpled bills that ranged from one dollar, two dollars, and up to fifty dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Here's 93 dollars. I know it isn't enough for today's medical expenses. I'll pay you again when I have enough money!" Veronica Barlow said in a grown-up tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was obvious that this money was all she had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the crumpled notes, Grace could not help smiling. "It's alright. I'll pay for Mason's medical bills today. You don't have to pay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, we're not related. We can't use your money. Besides, I have money. I can pay for Mason's medical bills!" said Veronica Barlow. Then, she was a little embarrassed. "Uh... I'll pay for the rest later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina asked, "Why do you insist on paying? What if the bill is 1,000 dollars? Are you going to insist on paying too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow answered firmly, "Yes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was a little surprised. After all, a seven-year-old girl was replying so firmly like an adult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you have 1,000 dollars?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow shook her head. "No, but I can save up the money. I get pocket money every month. I won't eat snacks or buy toys. I'll save up the money to pay you back! Ci is my younger brother, so I, the elder sister, should be responsible for paying his medical bills."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This girl seemed more responsible than many adults.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason looked at Veronica Barlow and said, "Sis, I won't see a doctor again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course, you should see a doctor when you're ill." Veronica Barlow looked at Mason with a straight face and said, "I have money. As I said, my mom left me a fortune. It&rsquo;ll all be mine when I'm 18. I can take care of you then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As she listened to the girl speak with a straight face, Grace suddenly felt her nose getting sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If her own brother had been alive, perhaps she would be just like this little girl after her mother's death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason blinked her beautiful eyes and replied, "Okay, you'll take care of me, Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His indifferent voice had a touch of trust in it. It was only directed to Veronica Barlow.</p></div>
