        <h1>Chapter 1727</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at Lina with mixed feelings. He had never thought of doing such a thing with her here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... when she kissed him like that, all his self-control disintegrated and he could even ignore the pain in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He loved her so much that nothing could ever change it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He probably could not send her home now. Hadwin Stephenson took a deep breath, tidied his clothes, sat in the driver's seat, and started the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The black car slowly drove away from the neighborhood as if it had never been here before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Half an hour later, Hadwin Stephenson arrived at his mansion in Emerald City. He carefully carried her into the mansion and to the bed in his bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She slept so soundly with the corners of her mouth slightly raised, looking as though she was having a nice dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;Could she be dreaming about me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, you still love me... don't you?" muttered Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As long as she still loved him, then he would solve whatever problems lay ahead of them. He would find a solution and give everything to fight for their future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He just wanted her to give him the motivation to give it his all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The night was quiet, and the room was enveloped with silence. However, it was not as cold as usual because of her presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Lina woke up, she saw an unfamiliar ceiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Where... am I?' She made a conscious attempt to sit up but her body felt sore all throughout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This soreness felt familiar. 'Could it be...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina panicked. Ignoring her sore body, she immediately sat up and began to check her body. She was not wearing her own clothes but an unfamiliar robe... It was a man's robe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was something about the robe that made her heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I remember going drinking with Grace yesterday. I hired ten male escorts and then... I drank a lot of wine too. I seemed to vaguely remember Jason as well&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as Lina was trying hard to recall everything that had happened after she got drunk, the room door was suddenly pushed open and a figure walked in. "Are you up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked blankly at Hadwin Stephenson, who walked in. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He asked, "Do you want to ask me why I&rsquo;m here? This is the bedroom in my mansion. You were with me last night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina suddenly realized it. 'Yes, this place... I've been here many times! I used to spend a lot of time in this room when we were dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It's just that the decor has changed so much that I... didn't realize it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the fact that she was in his bedroom surprised her even more. "I was with you last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson asked, "Why else do you think you're here? Or do you wish that... you were with another man last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His voice deepened in the middle of the sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina stiffened. 'So... I was with him last night...' For a moment, she did not know what to say. She just looked at him blankly.</p></div>
