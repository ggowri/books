        <h1>Chapter 2882</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's heart sank. Sure enough, he could find out anything he wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you do it?" Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross suddenly laughed. "You're asking me why? Brian, I&rsquo;ve loved you for so many years. What do you think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wouldn't love you even if Valda Theller didn't exist. If I wanted to fall for you, I would have done so from the beginning," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's mouth was full of bitterness. She knew that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, knowing was one thing. Her being reluctant and unwilling to accept it was a different matter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shouted, "Why did you choose Valda Theller? You love Grace because Grace saved your life when you were a child. What about Valda Theller? Why her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She accepted losing to Grace because she had never saved Brian's life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, how could she accept losing to Valda Theller? "Because she's the one who saved me from the messy relationship," replied Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean?" Phoebe Cross was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of explaining, he said, "Valda Theller is irreplaceable to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Irreplaceable... Haha, irreplaceable..." Phoebe Cross glared at the man in front of her. "Do you know you're irreplaceable to me too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whoever you love and consider irreplaceable is your business, but if you hurt Valda because of this, I won't let you off the hook!" His voice was still cold as if all her feelings and misery meant nothing to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is she that important?" Phoebe Cross asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he said with absolute certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A tinge of jealousy appeared on her face, but then she sneered sarcastically. "If she's that important, why did you turn away when you saw her being attacked and insulted? By the way, you went to the hospital, didn't you? Because Grace was hospitalized at that time. Haha, Brian, how dare you say that Valda Theller is important when you left her behind?! What a joke!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her sarcastic voice was so harsh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression turned cold. The next moment, he reached out his hand and slapped Phoebe Cross in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's laughter stopped abruptly, and she stumbled against the wall nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phoebe Cross, even if you&rsquo;re a woman and we grew up together, you should know what to say and what not to say!" His face seemed to be tinged with malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's cheek was swollen from the slap, and her face burned with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pulled herself up to her feet. "Are you mad from embarrassment? Brian, Valda Theller is nothing compared to Grace. You&rsquo;ll always love Grace. Valda Theller is just an unlucky fellow who thinks you love her, which isn&rsquo;t the case!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phoebe Cross, believe it or not, I promise you&rsquo;ll never be able to say a word again if you say one more thing about Valda!" His phoenix eyes glared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross froze. She knew he would keep his word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since the only person you love is Grace, wouldn't it be the same if you choose me? I have the Song family behind me. I'm the perfect candidate if you want to marry a woman to carry on the Hart family's bloodline! It doesn't matter even if you don't love me. I just want to stay by your side!" Phoebe Cross said, wanting to bet one last time.</p></div>
