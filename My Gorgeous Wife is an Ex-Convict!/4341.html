        <h1>Chapter 4339 The Most Suitable Person</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile suddenly played at the corners of Harley's mouth. It was a shallow one, tinged with a hint of self-mockery and a touch of loss. Then, without saying a word, she simply passed by Lornell's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's brow furrowed slightly, a strange feeling spreading in his heart until he watched Harley's figure disappear from his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lornell, what are you doing here..." Ursula's voice, tinged with a hint of panic, echoed behind Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell turned around, his gaze falling on Ursula.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gaze gave Ursula a chilling sense of fear as if some conspiracy had been seen through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley's right," Lornell said. "This is a marriage agreement between the Quentin family and the Hart family. You have no right to interfere. I hope you won't make such thoughtless comments in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ursula's face instantly turned ashen. Seeing Lornell about to leave, she quickly took two steps forward and grabbed his sleeve. "I was just telling the truth, is that wrong? I just don't want you to be unhappy! You only got into this marriage to save someone, why should you be trapped in it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does my happiness or lack thereof have to do with you?" Lornell said coldly, his gaze falling icily on the hand clutching his sleeve. "Let go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ursula shivered, finally letting go of Lornell's sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's words were so indifferent as if she had no connection with him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ursula couldn't accept it. Lornell had always treated her well before, even letting her stand by his side, taking Harley's place and chatting with others. Why was he so indifferent now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because of what she had just said? Or was it because of Harley?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I like you!" Ursula said, "When you like someone, you naturally wish for their happiness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ursula also took this opportunity to clearly express her feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lornell's gaze at her remained icy cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell snorted coldly, mockingly retorting, "And how would you know if I'm not happy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't even love </span><span>Harley,</span><span> how can you be happy!" Ursula said, "If you're going to get married, of course, you should find someone you love! Only a marriage based on love can bring happiness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you really think I would fall in love with you?" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of embarrassment flashed across Ursula's face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ursula, of course, felt that Lornell had a fondness for her. Even if it hadn't reached the point of love, she believed that as long as they continued, he would eventually fall in love with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could she possibly have said such a thing herself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, Ursula could only have awkwardly said, "I know, you don't love me, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before she could finish her words, Lornell interrupted her, "You're right, I don't love you, so you don't need to waste your thoughts on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you love Harley?" Ursula asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't love." Lornell's answer was so straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of joy crossed Ursula's face, but in the next moment, her joy seemed to freeze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I don't love her, she's still going to be my future wife. I don't think love should take up a huge part in life. For me, she's the most suitable choice," Lornell said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The best choice?" Ursula asked, her face full of bitterness. "Just because she's the daughter of the Hart family? </span><span>So</span><span> you think she's suitable? If she wasn't the daughter of the Hart family if she didn't have the Hart family backing her, would you still feel the same way?"</span></p></div>
