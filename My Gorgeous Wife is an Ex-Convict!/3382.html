        <h1>Chapter 3380</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wants to tell her his name, he wants to share his name with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Lornell woke up in the hospital room, he didn't know how he had passed out. It seemed like it was during Harley's humming of a tune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You finally woke up," a familiar voice sounded in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell looked at the woman by the hospital bed, who was his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You were lucky this time with the explosion. You didn't suffer any major injuries and you can be discharged from the hospital after a week. I will send some of the people who usually take care of you to stay at the hospital to look after you. If you need anything, you can also ask the people here for help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman spoke in a formulaic tone, and Lornell was already familiar with this way of speaking from women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does Father know about the explosion and my hospitalization?" Lornell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He knows. We informed him as soon as it happened, but he's not in Emerald City right now. He's attending a meeting in another city and probably won't be back to see you for another two days," the woman said, looking at Lornell's young and expressionless face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was her son, but she couldn't love him completely because he was the heir of the Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His existence was a constant reminder that her only purpose was to give birth to this child for the Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I have to go now. Rest well," she said, her beautiful and noble face showing only indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell didn't say anything, just watched his mother leave the hospital room without any reluctance. In his mind, he recalled the scene of the Hart family of three at the restaurant in the amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley's mother was not as beautiful as his own mother, and she even had a limp, but she exuded a gentle aura, with a warm smile on her face. She would hug and kiss the little one, and gently wipe the corners of his mouth and tidy his hair...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These were things he had never felt from his own mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She and he were like two completely different worlds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he had already become accustomed to his mother's cold treatment, so there was nothing to worry about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, what about the little one? How is she doing? Lornell's brow furrowed involuntarily. Although he didn't want to admit it, he understood that he cared about Harley's life and death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since he can still live well, that little guy must also be alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, there was a light knock on the door of the hospital room, and then someone came in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people who came in, besides the doctors and nurses, were those who had been with him since he was born and stayed by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the Quentin family, once a servant pledges loyalty to their master, they will serve that master for their entire life, unless the master passes away. Only then can the servant choose a new master.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And as long as he doesn't die young, these people who follow him will only have him as their master for their entire lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, the servants of the Quentin family are also particularly loyal to their masters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the doctor finished examining Lornell and gave some instructions, he left the room. The ones who stayed behind to take care of Lornell were his usual followers who often accompanied him.</p></div>
