        <h1>Chapter 2880</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, you've raised Valda, but I never came to visit you. I didn't expect my first visit to be in the hospital," said Brian as he looked at Ferris in a hospital gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard you're seriously ill and need a lot of money for an operation. What you have on your medical record is a serious illness. In this case, I'll call some specialists and have them perform an operation to cure you of your illness," Brian said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Theller family instantly turned pale at this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ferris was not seriously ill. They falsified it by colluding with the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They would be in trouble if they had a real operation. "Uhh... No thanks, Mr. Hart," said Ferris .</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said indifferently, "It's no trouble. It's just that I don't know whether you can get off the operating table with such a serious illness, Mr. Zhong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ferris 's legs instantly gave way, and he slumped down to the floor when he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago and Wynne even trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take Mr. Zhong to the operating room," Brian ordered his men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two burly men approached Ferris to pull him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ferris suddenly said, "Mr. Hart, I... I'm not sick. It's a fake illness. These two told me to fake it to get Valda to give us money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh? Is that so?" Brian's eyes turned to look at Rowena Santiago and Wynne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They looked frightened. "Ferris said Valda's rich. He said she's a member of the Theller family, so she should give the Theller family money to spend!" Rowena Santiago said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I said that, but... but it wasn't my idea to fake an illness!" Ferris was quick to plead his innocence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If it isn&rsquo;t because you&rsquo;re useless and not making much money, would we need to do this? You can't even afford to buy your son a house.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you and our son spend all the money? My younger brother and sister-in-law left behind a large inheritance, but you spent all of it. No matter how much money I make, it&rsquo;ll never be enough for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You gave me the money. You said we couldn't let your niece take advantage of it and that she would become someone else's wife in the future. You also said your son is the foundation of the Theller family..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The couple began to go over their debts with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's gaze fell on Wynne, the person responsible for the comic fiesta chaos that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, why did you go to the comic fiesta the other day and make a scene like that?" Brian asked Wynne coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne winched. "I only wanted to ask Valda for some money. I... I didn't expect it to cause such a commotion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn't expect it?" Brian sneered. "Did you not think you would have an extra three million dollars in your bank account too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Wynne immediately turned pale and knelt on the floor while Rowena Santiago and Ferris froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neither expected their son to suddenly have an extra three million dollars in his bank account.</p></div>
