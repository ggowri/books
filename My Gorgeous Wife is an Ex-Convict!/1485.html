        <h1>Chapter 1484</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since we can't change what has happened in the past, then... I want to let it go and not dwell on it. Just like what Lina said to me, we have to keep moving forward." Grace took a deep breath, letting go of her struggles and doubts little by little. She finally said what she had been thinking about for so long these days...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, I'm willing to forgive you, and I won't leave you. I didn't forget what I told you. I won't abandon you as long as you don't leave me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Yes, this was her decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she said this, her body seemed to tremble with some pain. It was as if all the pain was passing through her body, but... she was also relieved at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe... by letting this go, she could be happy and spend her life with the one she loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she really let go of him, she knew she would regret it in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's lips trembled. "Are you really willing to forgive me and not leave me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I won't leave you," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His mother left him, his father left him, and his grandfather had also left him, but she would not. She wanted to spend her life with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Tears came streaming down again when he heard this. "Grace... Grace..." He kept calling out to her name as he cried like a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She took a tissue and wiped his tears. "Stop crying. I forgive you, so stop crying..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I'll stop. I'll stop." He sobbed. He was crying more than ever today, but&hellip; she was the only one who could make him cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hands took her hand that was wiping his tears. "Grace, do you know how much I love you? Do you know how afraid I was that you would never forgive me? I was afraid... Afraid you would loathe me and leave me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only she could make him so afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her brows suddenly furrowed, and her body shuddered a little. His hands were wrapped around her hand, and the wave of warmth traveled from his hands to her hand. However, it made her body stiff. Then, nausea seemed to rise again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her other hand covered her mouth almost instinctively as she tried to suppress the feeling in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He withdrew his hands almost in a panic. His tear-streaked face was pale and helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sorry, but it may take a while before I can..." she murmured. 'I want to forgive Jay and let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But why is my body reacting this way?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it because... I haven't really let it go?' Grace looked down and speculated. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's tear-stained eyelashes trembled a little. "I'm the one who should be sorry. Grace, I'll wait for you. I'll wait for you to touch me and stop rejecting me. I'm willing to wait no matter how long it'll take."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her willingness to forgive him was already a great surprise to him today. No matter how much he wanted to hold her and kiss her, he would control himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She just needed to get used to it and forget what he had done back then... He would wait patiently. He would do it no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Tonight, instead of the caregiver accompanying Grace, it was Jason.</p></div>
