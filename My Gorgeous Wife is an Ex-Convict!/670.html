        <h1>Chapter 669</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A year?" Lina gave a low cry. "Then your wedding with Jason will also be postponed a year?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. "I haven't talked to Jason about this yet. I'll talk to him tonight and see what he thinks." However, she had a hunch that he would agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed as if he had agreed to every request she made ever since they started dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at her friend's haggard face and suggested. "Why don't we go to the shopping mall? Hadwin asked me to accompany him to a meeting. He said he&rsquo;s ordered a set of clothes for me to pick up at the shop in the shopping mall near here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina did not want to be noticed at all at such conferences, banquets, and so on. However, Hadwin kept dragging her to them as if he was addicted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The most infuriating of all was when she argued that she was busy at work and needed to work overtime or something, the fellow would only smile and say it did not matter. Then, she would get a call from her superior who said she need not work overtime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Needless to say, she knew Hadwin had talked to the boss of her company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They got to the nearby mall, and Lina approached the shop to pick up her clothes with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, the clothes Hadwin chose were not ordinary brands. It was a first-tier luxury brand where even the most basic clothes cost tens of thousands of dollars. Clothes that cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars were common in the shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina told them Hadwin's name, and the sales assistant immediately put on a smile on her face. She graciously took the clothes out for Lina to try on. If the clothes did not fit, they could modify it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait for me here, Grace," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. "Sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was browsing the shop when she heard a voice coming from the shop entrance behind her. "Aren't you spending too much buying me clothes and bags here, Brian? It doesn't matter if I use something worse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now that we're here, just buy some good stuff. Take whatever you like," the man's voice rang in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're so good to me, Brian." Stella Lindsay smiled sweetly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You saved me once, so I owe it to you," said Brian as he lightly looked away. However, when he saw the figure in the shop, his body stiffened suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even just the sight of her back made his eyes warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, through the glass wall in front of the figure, Brian's line of sight met a pair of almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's looking at me!' Grace looked at Brian's eyes through the glass wall and could sense that he was looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she looked at Brian, she could not help thinking of the dream she had last night. She never saw the face of the little boy in her dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, judging from the little girl and the little boy's experience in the dream and the fact that the little boy was called &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;, she felt as if the little boy in her dream was him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay followed Brian's gaze and saw Grace too. Her expression could not help but change instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay then smiled again and said, "Grace. I didn't expect to bump into you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around to look at Stella Lindsay. "It's quite a coincidence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you here to buy clothes? It just so happens that Brian said he was going to buy me some clothes and bags. Please help me choose them," said Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Stella Lindsay spoke, she lovingly linked arms with Grace in a sisterly manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A stranger might think the two of them were close.</p></div>
