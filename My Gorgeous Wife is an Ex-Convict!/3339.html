        <h1>Chapter 3337</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At noon, Grace went to the restaurant inside the amusement park with her two children to have a meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ordering the meal on her phone, Grace asked her two children to wait for her at the table while she went to pick up the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was flipping through some small brochures that were handed out by others in the amusement park, while asking Jasper, "What else is there to do later? Can you take me to play? I haven't had enough fun yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Jasper agreed readily, then curiously looked at the small booklets in William's hands, "What are these?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like there are some events organized by the amusement park and some companies outside," said William. "Some of these events are happening in the next few days. If there are any fun activities, let's go together. I rarely get to stay in Emerald City for a whole week."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William spoke, but did not hear Jasper's response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked up and saw Jasper holding a flyer, staring at it absentmindedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the brochure, there are many cartoon characters holding different instruments and singing and dancing. The bold letters on top say, "A music feast that brings joy to children!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is a promotional flyer for a children's musical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William glanced at the name of the theater company on the brochure and recognized it as a well-known company that specializes in children's plays. They have performed in Deer Capital before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just wasn't interested, so he didn't go see it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Jasper's focused expression, he asked, "Do you want to go see this musical?" The date displayed was the day after tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...I want to..." Jasper replied in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to go, then let's go together. I also want to see the musical!" William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But suddenly, Jasper's eyes turned red. "Before, I told Lawrence that we would go see this musical together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, the musical is finally starting in Emerald City the day after tomorrow, but Lawrence is nowhere to be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's eyes dimmed. So this was their promise, he realized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt a sour and uncomfortable feeling in his heart that he couldn't quite describe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he didn't realize that he was actually jealous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was jealous of Lawrence, jealous that Lawrence could have such an impact on her emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tomorrow, I'll go with you to see the musical. Let's say it's for Lawrence, so if you find him later, you can tell him what the musical was about," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't want the musical to become a regret in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since she had promised to go see it with Lawrence before, he could replace Lawrence and accompany her to see it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Grace returned to their seats with the food and saw her daughter's red eyes. She was a bit puzzled and asked, "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, it was impossible for the two children to quarrel. Basically, William would always give in to Jasper. Even if Jasper was being unreasonable, William would probably unconditionally support her and not get angry with her.</p></div>
