        <h1>Chapter 1072</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Grace sat at the dining table and looked at the soup and three other dishes that were still hot. However, they looked so average that they did not look like a chef made them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I cooked them. Give them a try," he said as if sensing her confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was slightly surprised. 'He can... cook?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You cooked for me when we were at the rental house, so why can&rsquo;t I cook for you? If you don't like the taste, I'll learn and improve for the next time," he said. His peach blossom eyes were smiling at her as if they had never broken up and there were no painful memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They seemed to have gone back to the sweetest time they shared together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked away uncomfortably, not wanting to meet his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes seemed to have some magic power in them, setting off waves in her calm heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are the servants? Why don't I see any other servants here?" she asked, looking for a topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "There are no servants here. Of course, someone will come by regularly to replenish the fridge and clean the place, but you won't have much chance to see them. Just take it as there are only you and me here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He continued saying, "It's just me and you here, so you can look at me and consider when to fall in love with me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you, it's impossible," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "I've told you, you'll fall in love with me again! Why won't you look at me if you think it's impossible?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lower lip and turned her head around, her almond-shaped eyes finally looking at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their eyes met in mid-air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She glared at him while he stared at her, smiling faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyelashes quivered slightly after some time, and he said, "Alright. Let's eat first. The food is going to get cold if you don't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he lowered his eyes and started eating with a pair of chopsticks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly breathed a sigh of relief. She thought that she was being a little childish when she realized the way she had looked into his eyes earlier was as if she was a primary school student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked into his eyes to deny that she would fall in love with him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could feel her heartbeat accelerating when she looked into his eyes. It was as if it was telling her his influence on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her head and ate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cooking was neither good nor bad, but others would be surprised to learn that she had the chance to eat the food prepared by Emerald City's Master Reed himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed at herself, never thinking that one day she could eat his cooking under such circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What on earth is this place?" she could not help asking.</p></div>
