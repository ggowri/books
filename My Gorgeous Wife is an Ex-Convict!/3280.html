        <h1>Chapter 3278</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you okay?" she asked with some concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, I'm going to take a shower," he said, quickly getting up and heading towards the second floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda watched Brian's quickly departing figure, feeling a sweet sensation in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although... he seems to be enduring a lot, does this also mean that she has a strong attraction to him? It's actually quite satisfying to see her husband unable to control his feelings for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, not only him, but she as well. He knows that when he shouts her name with a hoarse voice and kisses her all over, she really wants him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For now, we can only endure it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My dear baby, your daddy and mommy have endured a lot for you." Valda lowered her head and spoke to her baby inside her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hmm, I'm really looking forward to the future and the life of our baby after they're born! I'm sure it will be even happier then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Terrence visited Lawrence's school, nobody dared to bully Lawrence anymore. Even the teachers' attitudes towards Lawrence have improved significantly. The classmates who used to look down on Lawrence have also changed their behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His classmates often hang out with him and even share their snacks with him. They also frequently give him various stationery and small souvenirs brought from abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And these things are not cheap either, obviously they were given by the parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence didn't want to take these things, but his mother Wilona insisted that he take them all. She would even blame him if he refused to take them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This was a gift from someone else, why didn't you accept it? They only gave it to us because they see that we have the Reed family supporting us. If in the future, Jasper doesn't want you to accompany him anymore, do you think they will still hold us in such high regard?" said Wilona.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wants to seize everything she can possibly grab right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're collecting things outside all day, be careful not to upset the Reed family if they find out," Doran reminded his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I only received some small things, nothing valuable. Even if the Reed family finds out, it doesn't matter. Besides, the Reed family is wealthy and has bigger concerns than these little things," Wilona said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You said it yourself, they are treating us well now because Jasper values Lawrence's piano skills. But if there comes a day when Jasper no longer values Lawrence, then Lawrence won't have to attend piano lessons with her all the time. How will others treat us then?" said Doran.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is more clear-headed on this point than his own wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the big deal? By that time, I already had money, a house, a car, and plenty of savings. What could those people do to me?" Wilona said. "Anyway, for now, I'll try to get as much as I can, so I won't regret it later when I can't get it anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The couple chatted away, completely oblivious to their son's pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence is biting his lips tightly and looks anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If in the future, Jasper doesn't value his piano anymore, does that mean he can't stay by Jasper's side?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What should he do then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is not Mr. Barlow, so it's impossible for him to be like Mr. Barlow. Even if he practices playing the piano less or doesn't play at all, he can still video chat with Jasper every day and spend summer and winter vacations with her in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He...he was only able to be with Jasper because of the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he thought about this, Lawrence suddenly felt a sense of fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afterwards, he started spending more time practicing the piano every day. Even their professor, who was teaching them, kept praising him for his rapid progress.</p></div>
