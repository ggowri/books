        <h1>Chapter 2801</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a sigh, he kissed away her frantic voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked and froze. Moments later, she heard Brian's elegant voice in her ears. "Okay, this is the next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze before feeling Brian's hand caressing her head. "There can be a next time and more if you want..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes instantly lit up with joy. &lsquo;Does he mean... I can kiss him again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt like they were getting more comfortable with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was suddenly a knock on the door, which ruined their mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hurriedly said, "I... I'll get it." She could also calm her heart, which was racing at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her expression sank when she reached the door and opened it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people in front of her were her aunt, Rowena Santiago, and her cousin, Wynne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Rowena Santiago saw Valda Theller, she said, "Valda, I told you that you shouldn't be so heartless. You refused when I asked you to lend me some money the last time. If I hadn't heard from your cousin that your latest boyfriend is the crown prince of the entertainment industry, I'd have thought you were really broke."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned. Aunt and the rest had probably learned about her relationship with Brian through online news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne looked displeased as he said, "Valda, you're already the crown prince's girlfriend. You've probably made a lot of money from the crown prince. You&rsquo;re being very stingy to refuse to lend us some money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, your cousin is the only child of the Theller family. Shouldn't you contribute money and effort to his marriage?" Rowena Santiago said accusingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller just found it funny. 'Only child? What does that make me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My cousin is the only child of your family, not mine. I have no obligation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago snapped, "Valda, you shouldn't say that. Our family? Don't forget that your last name is Zhong! And your cousin and his girlfriend are preparing to get married. He has to buy a house and pay for the dowry. Since you're the girlfriend of the crown prince surnamed Hart, it's not too much to give your cousin a house right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Give him a house?" Valda Theller did not expect her aunt to be so greedy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's only a house. It&rsquo;ll only cost millions of dollars. It's nothing compared to what you can get from the crown prince. Besides, it'll do you good if your cousin looks well-off. You don't want people to say the crown prince's girlfriend's cousin can't even afford a house when he marries, do you?" Rowena Santiago said matter-of-factly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller immediately refused, saying, "I won't buy him a house. No matter what kind of person my boyfriend is, it's none of your business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Their expressions changed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne threatened her by saying, "Aren't you afraid we'll tell the crown prince that you killed your parents?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, would your parents have died in the accident if they hadn&rsquo;t been protecting you? You're the one who made such a fuss about going to that stupid place!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, you're responsible for your parents' death! Would you be standing here today if we hadn't taken care of you for so many years? If the crown prince knows you&rsquo;re so heartless, he&rsquo;ll probably dump you right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two chimed in. Each sentence was a threat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face gradually turned pale, and the voice of her parents during the car accident sounded in her ears. At the time, Valda Theller kept crying and had no idea what was happening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she realized it, her parents could never open their eyes anymore.</p></div>
