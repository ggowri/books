        <h1>Chapter 1258</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have morning sickness very often, but it seemed so severe every time. It was as if she had to throw up everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she emerged from the bathroom stall, she met Andrea Schwartz face to face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since the video of Andrea Schwartz cheating and getting beaten up by a starlet went viral online, Andrea Schwartz had behaved herself in the office and did not bother her much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the way Andrea Schwartz looked at her now made Grace feel somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace passed by Andrea Schwartz and walked over to the sink to wash her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz suddenly said, "Grace, you threw up so much. Why does it look a little like morning sickness?" she asked tentatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if it is?" Grace admitted it bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she was pregnant, her belly would show after some time anyway, so she could not hide it from anyone. Besides, she never intended to keep it a secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz was stunned, not expecting her to admit it so bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you... really pregnant? You got pregnant before marriage?" Andrea Schwartz said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ignored Andrea Schwartz and walked straight out of the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, news of her pregnancy was already all over the office before noon. Some colleagues even ran up to her and asked curiously, "Grace, Andrea Schwartz said you got pregnant before marriage. Is it true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace could answer, Andrea Schwartz popped out of nowhere and said sarcastically, "Is it true? She admitted it in the bathroom just now. You just didn't see it. The way she threw up earlier is the same as the way pregnant women threw up in TV series."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied lightly, "I'm indeed pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if she had gotten hold of something to use against Grace, Andrea Schwartz immediately shouted, "Look, she admitted herself that she's pregnant!" The volume seemed loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All their colleagues in the general office looked their way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz was even more pleased with herself. She had been timid and cautious because of her video scandal. Now, the attention could shift from her scandal to Grace&rsquo;s!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she had that scandal only because of Grace, so she wanted to make Grace even more embarrassed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, this is a bad influence. You've only worked here for less than three months, haven't you? And now you're pregnant? Did you only look for a job to raise your baby? That's so selfish! Though you're not technically in the wrong, what would others think of you? Besides, you got pregnant before marriage...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never said I was pregnant before marriage," Grace said as she glanced lazily at Andrea Schwartz. "But what are you trying to do by deliberately telling our colleagues that I got pregnant before marriage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz was dumbfounded. "Are you... married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think?" Grace asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You never told me! How would I know you're married? Jeez!" Andrea Schwartz hurriedly looked for an excuse.</p></div>
