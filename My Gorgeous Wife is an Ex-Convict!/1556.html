        <h1>Chapter 1554</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, he opened his mouth and said to Brian, "The one she loves now is me. So what if you met her earlier than me? Even if I don't love her, she'll only have me in her heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's hand instantly grabbed Grace's jaw as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. Before she could figure out what he wanted to do, she saw his face quickly approaching hers. Then, his warm lips were pressed against her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stared blankly at the face in front of her. He... was kissing her. Besides, it was in front of Brian. There were even security guards and the driver around them...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She felt a little uncomfortable doing this in public, but she did not want to push him away or reject the kiss. No matter the reason he was kissing her, it was the first time he was doing so after five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help but close her eyes and indulged in the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jay, Jay! Does he know how much I love him? Does he know how it hurt my heart when he said he doesn&rsquo;t love me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if she knew he only said so because of his memory loss, she could not control the pain that overcame her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her heart ached for both of them. Her heart ached for the suffering he went through after she fell into the ocean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At least she had forgotten everything when she woke up and never suffered that pain. Just what sort of pain had he suffered back then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Life and death. The one alive often suffered the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He &lsquo;did not love her&rsquo; now because he had &lsquo;loved her too much&rsquo; back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian stared blankly at the scene in front of him. It was so familiar to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But Grace kissed Jason in front of me to make me give up on her back then. Now, is Jason doing this to show that Grace is still his wife even if he doesn't love her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace isn't someone who likes to be the center of attention in public, but she&rsquo;s not pushing Jason away. Is Jason still the only one occupying Grace's heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Even after all these years, I still can&rsquo;t get some of the love in her heart?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the kiss was over, Brian had loosened his grip on Grace's arm. His eyes were filled with pain, self-mockery, and helpless despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could have gotten any woman he wanted, but she was the only woman he could not get.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason slowly looked up at Grace, who seemed to still be lost in their earlier kiss. He muttered, "Do you love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes..." she could not help replying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He smiled faintly and glanced at Brian, who was in a daze, as if there was no need for him to say anything else. This scene was proof enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason took Grace by the hand and walked toward the house. It was only now that the people around them came to their senses. They were naturally surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who would have thought that Young master Reed would kiss Young Madam like that in public? Some of the people who were still working here five years ago had seen how much Jason cared about Young Madam.</p></div>
