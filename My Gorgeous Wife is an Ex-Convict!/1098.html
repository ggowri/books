        <h1>Chapter 1097</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to sense what she was thinking, and his thin lips parted lightly. "Don't worry. I won't let the old man have the chance to hurt you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gently lowered her eyes and got up to put the empty bowl aside. "Rest well. I'll go back to my room first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could turn around, his hand had already grabbed her sleeve. He looked at her with his chin slightly up, and there was a glint in his bright eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She asked, "Jason, what are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You feel something for me, don't you? Otherwise, you wouldn&rsquo;t watch over me, make me take my medicine, make porridge for me..." His hoarse voice escaped his mouth little by little. His expression was one of supplication and longing. "Grace, fall in love with me, alright? I never knew I could love a woman so deeply!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the high and mighty Master Reed to others, but he was willing to swallow all his pride just to ask her to love him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mind seemed to go blank for an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian tried to track Grace down with almost every connection he had, but it was not that easy. He had connections, but so did Jason. Of course, Jason could stop him from tracking them down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only Grace but even Jason had not shown up in days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, the search seemed to have hit a dead-end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had never been so distracted. He could not even concentrate on what Stella was telling him. His mind was preoccupied with Grace's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he told his parents that he was in love with Grace, his parents were shocked and disapproved. They were unwilling to accept Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They even tried to persuade him not to get too obsessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However&hellip; I'm already obsessed with her. The obsession is so intense I just can't get myself out of it. Even if I have to go against Jason, I still don't want to give up.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, did you hear me?" said Stella. She spoke until her mouth was dry, but Brian seemed to be thinking of something else and did not respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could he be thinking about Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella had these thoughts out of jealousy. 'Grace hasn&rsquo;t shown up in days. Jason seemed to have taken her somewhere.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella hoped Grace never showed up again so that Brian would never have to think about her again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did you say?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said... my birthday is in a few days. Can I have a birthday party this year?" said Stella as she looked at Brian expectantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at her with some indifference after hearing what she said. "Your cousin is missing, yet you're thinking about your birthday party?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace's with Jason. They were a couple. Maybe they're having a sweet time with each other right now..." she said deliberately to make Brian give up on Grace. "Maybe she and Jason will show up in a few days, all intimate again. Besides... I want to use my birthday to celebrate our reunion. I can't not celebrate anything just because of Grace, can I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pursed his thin lips for a moment and then said, "Alright, I see. I'll get someone to prepare your birthday party. You can talk to them if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's face lit up, and she was about to say something when Brian's phone suddenly rang.</p></div>
