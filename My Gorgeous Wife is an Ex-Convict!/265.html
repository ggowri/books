        <h1>Chapter 264</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Now that Grace can&rsquo;t get anything good in her life, she doesn&rsquo;t want Evelyn to live happily either!&rdquo; Melinda Riley said angrily. "If she ruins Evelyn's relationship with Brian, I'm going to kill her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Tony Cummins said, "Is there a misunderstanding here?" After all, Grace was also his daughter. It did not matter to him which daughter was going to be with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The key was that he could be Brian's father-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What misunderstanding can there be? She's just trying to climb the social ladder!" Melinda Riley said. "How else does she know Jason? Doesn&rsquo;t she know that she's an ex-convict? Will anyone take her seriously?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Melinda Riley was now sparing no effort to denigrate her stepdaughter, fearing that this stepdaughter would rob her daughter of a good marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Evelyn is different. Evelyn is innocent! She is also Brian's serious girlfriend right now. It's only natural for her to become the best actress and marry into the Hart family," The way that Melinda Riley said it made it sound like Evelyn was going to be the queen of cinema tomorrow and instantly become the Hart family&rsquo;s daughter-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tony Cummins nodded and said, "Alright, then I'll ask Grace to come home and talk to her. I'll tell her to keep her distance from Brian and not meddle in Evelyn's affairs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn and Melinda Riley looked at each other, their faces bright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thanks, Dad," Evelyn said. However, she started to look concerned. "But what if Sis won't listen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm her father. Unless her last name is not Cummins, she'll have to do what I say!" Tony Cummins said, looking tough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn lowered her head slightly, and a smile tugged at the corners of her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace got a call at night from her father, Tony Cummins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, you haven't been back for a long time. Why don't you come home, and we&rsquo;ll talk about moving your mother's grave?" Tony Cummins said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Moving her grave?" Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, at first your mother was buried in the village cemetery, but now they&rsquo;re renovating the place. The land is expropriated. A lot of graves there have to be relocated. You were in prison, so you didn't know about this. The village has already sent out the documents," Tony Cummins said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace pursed her lips slightly. When her mother died, she did not buy a plot of ground in the public cemetery. Her father asked a friend who was from the village near Emerald City for help. There was a public cemetery in the village, and no money was needed, so her mother was buried there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When her mother died, her father did not visit her for many years. It was not until later when she studied so hard till she was admitted to a prominent high school and even a prominent university that her father and stepmother went to pay their respects at her mother's grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After she went to prison, her father and his family naturally did not visit her mother's grave during Tomb Sweeping Day and Winter Solstice Festival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After getting out of prison and visiting her mother&rsquo;s grave, she saw that the weeds had grown so much that they almost covered the words on the gravestone. Cracks had also appeared on the gravestone. She thought of repairing the gravestone when she went to pay her respects on Tomb Sweeping Day, but she did not expect to move the grave completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Fine, I'll go back," Grace said. She would never have agreed to go back if it had not been to discuss her mother's affairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then come back tomorrow night. What do you want to eat? I'll send your stepmother to prepare it," Tony Cummins said in a paternal tone, causing Grace to be absent-minded for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was speaking to her in the same tone as when her career and love life were flourishing back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, after she went to prison, everything changed. She realized that she was only his daughter when she was useful, and when she was useless, not a trace of affection was left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, I'll come after dinner," Grace said. She then ended the call and put away her phone.</p></div>
