        <h1>Chapter 704</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ll never let her remember it, no matter in what way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I want her to think of me alone!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Grace was in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked into the bathroom with Grace in his arms. He gently put her into the bathtub full of warm water and gently cleaned her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She leaned her head on one side, falling sound asleep, yet her comely face was driving him mad with love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If you were deeply in love with someone, you would be attracted by whatever they did. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was fair, but the fairer she was, the more obvious the old scars were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These scars were from when she was in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each time he saw her scars, he felt guilty and heavy in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe he would have a hard time getting rid of this feeling for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as he loved her, he would carry that feeling with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In addition to the old wounds, there were red spots on her skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if they were the silent proof that she was his!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was done washing her, Jason lifted Grace out of the water and wrapped her in a dry towel before putting her in a pair of pajamas. Then, he carried her back to bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so tired that she was in a deep slumber the entire time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked down at her sleeping face as his slender fingers ran gently through her long hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't you just let some memories remain lost when they&rsquo;re lost? Why must you find them?" A cold voice rang in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What answered him was the silent air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, don't get your memory back, all right? Just keep it that way. Just leave it as it is." He was so gentle, his voice like a lover's most touching whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was still sound asleep like a sleeping princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Grace looked like she could dazzle onlookers in her silver gown and ruby jewelry, especially after the stylist's help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Grace stared blankly at herself in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she put this into words? The stylist had put on light makeup for her today. Therefore, there was not much difference in her features before and after makeup, but the overall feeling had changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The peachy makeup added a playful touch, making Grace feel like she was seeing her college self.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She put on seven-inch high heels and headed with Jason to the trade fair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I embarrass you later?" Grace asked on the way. After all, the trade fairs Jason attended were not small, and with his social status, the two of them would naturally grab everyone's attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she would try hard not to embarrass him, she was a little worried when she thought of the previous time she had accompanied him to a banquet and ended up getting picked on.</p></div>
