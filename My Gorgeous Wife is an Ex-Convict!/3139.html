        <h1>Chapter 3137</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am Brian's fianc&eacute;e. Are you trying to make enemies with Brian and the Hart family by treating me like this?" Valda spoke up, knowing that she represented more than just herself now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Heh, when Brian finds out you're a cripple, think about how he'll treat you," the person who was stepping on her hand sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before he could finish his sentence, he was slapped to the ground by a sudden force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A figure hurriedly crouched in front of Valda and asked, "Valda, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Brian, who had finally appeared, and her eyes turned slightly red. "Brian, I'm sorry," she whispered. She didn't want to embarrass him and wanted to accompany him to the film festival with dignity, but now it had turned out like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian felt a deep sense of pain in his heart. Her apology only made him feel worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that he was the one who should apologize. He failed to protect her and allowed her to suffer such humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he saw her lying on the ground, trying to get up but being stopped by others, his blood boiled with anger. He wished he could kill someone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could anyone treat his precious one with such disrespect?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian carefully helped Valda up and held her right hand. He looked at the swelling on the back of her hand and asked softly, "Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It hurt a little when it was stepped on, but it's better now," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who stepped on it?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was the person you pushed away just now," Valda said. "Brian, can we go back now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was in a mess and didn't feel comfortable staying here any longer. Besides, she knew he must be very angry after what happened to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was worried that he might do something unfavorable in front of everyone, which could lead to public criticism.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the worry in her eyes, he said, "Okay, let's go back first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for those who were giving her a hard time earlier, he naturally has a way to deal with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as the two of them were about to leave, Tracy's group clearly didn't want it to end like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian!" Tracy exclaimed, "Don't easily believe your fianc&eacute;e. You don't know yet, but she clearly has a problem with her legs and deliberately uses shoes to cover it up so you won't find out. She has ulterior motives and is very cunning!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Tracy said this, she intentionally raised her voice, wanting everyone around to hear her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two female companions standing behind Tracy quickly chimed in agreement, "Yes, Brian, don't let this woman deceive you! She's nothing but a fraud!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian suddenly stopped in his tracks, turned around, and stared fiercely at the three people with sharp eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian looked at the three of them like that, they all felt a bit uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, everything we said was the truth!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just take a look at her shoes and you'll know what's going on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda tightly bit her lower lip and unconsciously tightened her grip on Brian's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian turned his head and looked at the pale faces of the people next to him. "Valda, please wait for me for a moment. I'll deal with these people and leave with you soon," he said.</p></div>
