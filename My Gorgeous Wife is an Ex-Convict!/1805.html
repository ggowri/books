        <h1>Chapter 1803</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Rosalind Bush, who was nearby, looked enthusiastic as she said, "Mrs. Reed, don't take it to heart. Mason's still little. Don't worry, Yetian and I will take good care of him while you let him stay at the He family&rsquo;s house!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Rosalind Bush seemed to have forgotten how they used to treat Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The He family thought the longer Mason stayed in the He family, the better. That way, the He family would have a better chance of getting on the Reed family's good side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina walked over from the store. After hearing Rosalind Bush's hypocritical words, she sneered and said, "I wonder who beat up such a small child until there were wounds all over his body previously. How shameless of you to say that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Rosalind Bush's expression stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina crouched down again and looked at Mason. "You should know that your mommy suffered a lot for you. You&rsquo;re able to stand here and wait for your sister to finish school because your mommy saved you by disregarding her own life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason's pretty little mouth was tightly closed and he did not say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had dealt with the little one before and understood that his personality was not quite the same as ordinary children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your mommy is the one who loves you the most, got it?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The one who loves me the most is Sis!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Huh?' Lina was amused by the little one. "Do you know what it feels like to love someone that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sis loves me the most, and I love Sis the most!" Mason said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"This kid..." Lina was speechless by the little one's stubbornness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Love? How would a five-year-old know what that means?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "Alright, Mason. Daddy and I are the ones who love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the bell rang. The little one immediately stopped speaking and stared intently at the students coming out of the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Finally, when Veronica Barlow's small figure walked out of the school gate, Mason ran toward her and threw himself into her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at Mason's attachment to Veronica Barlow, Grace felt a little bitter. However, she still felt grateful to Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If it were not for the little girl protecting Mason with her tiny body, Mason&rsquo;s life in the past two years would have been a lot worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason was probably so attached to Veronica Barlow because she truly cared about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"aunt Cummins, Uncle Reed." After Veronica Barlow saw them, she asked a little timidly, "Are you... here to take Mason away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason hugged her even tighter when she asked that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "No, we're just here to see Mason. Mason may be staying at your house for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Veronica Barlow instantly felt a burst of relief when she heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace talked to Veronica Barlow again. Then, she insisted on sending Veronica Barlow and Mason back to the He family&rsquo;s house. Jason naturally accompanied her while Archer Barlow and Rosalind Bush looked elated and smug.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If word got out that Jason and his wife had gone to their house, everyone would think highly of them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said to Grace, "I'm not going to the He family&rsquo;s house. How are your hands? Did the doctor say when they would return to normal?"</p></div>
