        <h1>Chapter 2710</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. That's all," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have to take your medicines before lunch. I'll ask the restaurant manager for a glass of warm water," Kyla said and got up to leave. Moments later, she came over with a glass of warm water. Then, she took the medicines out of her bag and handed them to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss swallowed the medicines with water, then Kyla said, "Sit here while I go over to their message wall."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned. He had seen the message wall she was referring to as soon as they came in. There were many small pieces of paper on it, and each piece contained a written sentence or a drawing. They were left by customers, and the wall was a feature of the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was not interested in such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He watched her walk up to the message wall. She looked as if she were reading the messages carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He vaguely remembered her writing a message when they first came here. He was curious and wanted to ask what she wrote, but she refused to say and only said she would tell him in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'In the future... There's no future between us.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, he saw her bend over with a pen in hand. She was writing something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's not writing a message again, is she? How... silly!' Martin Weiss curled his lips as he kept his eyes from gazing at Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Kyla was back at the table, and the dishes they ordered were served.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's eat. I'll start," said Kyla before lowering her head and digging in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss did not touch his chopsticks. He suddenly asked, "Why did you kiss me when we were in the church?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand that was holding the chopsticks paused as she hesitated for a while, "Do I need a reason to kiss you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then said. "If you think I need a reason, perhaps the church had such a good atmosphere that I couldn't help myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You couldn't help yourself?" His dark eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled faintly. "Martin Weiss, do you think I can resist your charm?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together uneasily. "I don't find your joke funny."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not joking. We're now husband and wife. Isn't it normal that a wife can't help kissing her husband?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glared at her. "Kyla, what are you playing at? I'm telling you, it doesn't matter what tricks you pull. You're going to have to sign the divorce papers once today ends!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "I know. Don't worry. I'm not gonna play games. I only answered you seriously. I truly couldn't help myself at the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She met his eyes without evading them and confessed her feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, he looked away, picked up his chopsticks, and began eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes shone vaguely with disappointment. She had kissed him in the church to make that kiss their wedding kiss.</p></div>
