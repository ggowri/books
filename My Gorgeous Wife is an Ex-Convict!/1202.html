        <h1>Chapter 1201</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason brought Grace out of the elevator when it stopped at the floor where the president's office was located.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go... What are you trying to do..." she cried out. His grim expression and the forceful aura emanating all over him gave people a sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was even more impossible to guess what he was thinking at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While the secretaries looked on, no one dared to step forward. After Jason brought Grace into the office, the secretaries looked at each other and agreed to act as if nothing had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was an unconcealable shock in their eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These secretaries naturally knew Grace and had secretly discussed before that Grace could join the Reed family and become the mistress of the Reed family. After all, they had never seen Master Reed pay so much attention to a woman before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, these days, Grace had become such a taboo that someone who had accidentally said the word &lsquo;Grace&rsquo; was immediately fired!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Secretary Jackson later secretly told them not to mention anything related to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretaries thought Cinderella had lost her chance, but they never expected this to happen today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the office, Grace said in a fluster, "Jason, let go..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she finished speaking, he suddenly let go of his hand. As she could not get her footing, she stumbled and nearly fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said coldly, "Let go. Of course, I'll let go! But I really want to know why you appear in front of me again and again when you've knelt on the ground and begged me to let you go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He drew nearer and nearer to her. The heavy pressure that reeked of danger almost made her breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She subconsciously backed away as she said, "It's just... a coincidence. I didn't mean to appear in front of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A coincidence?" He suddenly sneered. "If the last few times were coincidences, what about today? Why did you appear at Reed Group's entrance? Why don't you tell me where you're going that you have to pass through here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless. She did not even know why she had unknowingly ended up here! Her mind had been in a whirl, thinking about what to do with Chase Harper's case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her silence deepened the look of sarcasm on his face. "What's the matter? Are you speechless?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His steps came closer. As she continued to step back, her calf hit the arm of the couch behind her. She staggered and fell onto the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace made a conscious attempt to sit up, but her legs were on the arms of the couch and her back was pressed against the seat. It made it difficult for her to sit up at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Jason had leaned over with one hand pressed on the back of the couch while the other was pressed on the seat beside her. For a moment, she looked as if she were imprisoned in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This position made Grace embarrassed. "What... are you trying to do?" She glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I should be the one to ask you what you're trying to do!" said Jason. Did she know that her appearance disturbed his heart, which he was trying to calm down? "Grace, are you playing hard to get?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face approached hers, his warm breath spraying on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face could not help turning red, and she denied it. "No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does Brian not treat you well enough? Is that why? So you want to come back to me?" he murmured, his fingers gently caressing her cheek though his expression remained cold.</p></div>
