        <h1>Chapter 315</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the sleeping face before him, he took one of her hands in his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He found her! She no longer existed only in his memory but had appeared in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You agreed today. I won't allow you to go back on it." His voice rang faintly in the quiet room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only answered by each other's breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the interview, Grace returned to Reed Residence. Today's interview was quite simple for her. The interviewer just looked at her health certificate and asked her some basic questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When asked why she, a brilliant law graduate, wanted to be a food delivery rider, she was already ready to answer that, but she was nervous and could only say in the simplest possible terms that she had been jailed for a traffic offense, so her lawyer's license was revoked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No further questions were asked after that. They just told her to go home and wait for a reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that the interview might have gone wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that question was an impossible question to get past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Emerald City had about a dozen large and small companies that were looking for food delivery riders. Grace had sent her resume to every company. She did not know if there were any that would hire her, but she felt exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if... it was tiring to stay alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was the events after her release from prison that left her physically and mentally exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they were having dinner that evening, Jason suddenly said, "You applied for a job as a food delivery rider today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and could hardly hold her chopsticks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, are you surprised?" Jason smiled and said, "I got a call from the boss today. He said you applied for a job at her place, so she wanted to ask me for my opinion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. She remembered that the interviewer who interviewed her did not ask her specifically who the victim of the car crash was. She thought if she did not tell, he might not know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who knew that the company&rsquo;s boss would personally call Jason. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was a big, merciless slap from reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now, what should I say to her?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips, but her mind was as clear as a mirror. Normally, would the boss call about a rider? They could just reject her application.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They probably called to take credit. They thought she killed Jennifer Atkinson and Jason should hate her, so they revealed her whereabouts to get on the Reed family's good side and please Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that left Grace feeling sick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want me to talk to them and make them hire you?" Jason continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "You don't seem to like that company very much. I don't happen to like it very much either. In that case, I'd better get rid of the company."</p></div>
