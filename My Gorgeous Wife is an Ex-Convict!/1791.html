        <h1>Chapter 1789</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, you love Jason in this life, but... if there's a next life, will you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even in the next life, she&rsquo;ll only be with me!" A cold voice interrupted Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian instantly stiffened. He raised his head, looked over, and saw Jason standing not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared solemnly at Brian with a touch of gloom and rage in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed," the bodyguards around them greeted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace turned to look at Jason, naturally taking her hands out of Brian's. Brian instantly found his hands empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason walked up and said to Brian, "Brian, in this life, the next one, and the one after that, Grace will still be mine! Don't even think about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian stared at the man in front of him. "You're the same as before. If you want something, you'll do whatever it takes to get it without giving others a chance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why should I give others a chance if I want it?" retorted Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two men looked at each other, the atmosphere becoming awkward and tense again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace quickly said to Jason, "Jay, I'm... I'm a little tired. I want to go back to the ward to rest. Let's go back to the ward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason turned around to look at Grace and said, "Okay, let's go back to the ward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As he spoke, he bent over and carried her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help but whisper, "Jay, I... I can walk." She had only hurt her hands, not her legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know, but I want to carry you like this," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"..." Grace was instantly at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian, who was still standing in the same spot, smiled sarcastically. Jason was doing this on purpose to put on a show for him. He was as possessive of Grace as he was then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if Grace would forever be his regret in this life and even if he did not intend to forgive Jason for what he had done, he... still hoped that Jason could treat Grace well and Grace could truly be happy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Tomorrow, he would leave Emerald City after Grace's operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace's operation... will be a success!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason carried Grace back to the ward and carefully put her on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Brian came to see you. What did you talk about?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing. He was just wishing me a smooth operation tomorrow," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Oh yes, he also said he's taking over a project and is going to leave Emerald City for a few years. I think Brian must have gotten over his feelings for me. It felt like he was here to say goodbye to me.&rdquo;</p></div>
