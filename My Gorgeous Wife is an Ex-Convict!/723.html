        <h1>Chapter 722</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that she needed to get to the bottom of her dreams and headaches!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace made up her mind and arranged the appointment with Dr. Leng on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just after Grace ended the call, Terrence knocked on the door and entered Jason's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed, Miss Cummins has just contacted the psychiatrist with the last name Leng. The appointment is scheduled for the day after tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his eyes. His long fingers held the pen in his hand, still signing smoothly on the papers. "All right, got it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Terrence withdrew from the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only at the moment when the door was about to close that he heard a faint crack in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if something had cracked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door of the president's office closed and Jason sat on a sofa chair, still in the same position, but he had stopped signing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pen in his hand had broken in two, and his handsome face was clouded with gloom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Grace... Still trying to get her lost memories back? Is she trying to retrieve the memories associated with Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why? She said she wanted to grow old with me, but why would she want to get back the memories associated with other men?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be that no matter how much I love her and crawl at her feet, there&rsquo;ll always be a place in her heart for Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're so heavy. Carrying you is tiring." The little girl seemed to be complaining.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I.. I'm sorry..." It was the boy's sobs. He sounded embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never thought that one day he would let a girl carry him like this. However, now his feet hurt so badly that he could not walk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they did not leave this hill as soon as possible, the bad guys would find them sooner or later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they were not found, they would not be able to find food or water on the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had mentioned that she would run down the hill to get the police, but he was afraid&ndash;afraid to be left alone in this strange place, and afraid that she would never come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was older than her, and he was a boy. He should have been the one to comfort her, but in the end, she saw his fear and comforted him instead, saying, "Let's get off the hill together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Together... What a beautiful word.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the first time, he felt that these two words were so reassuring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her little body carried him on her back and she walked over the thorny hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every step was so hard, and her floral dress had more holes in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew how much she liked the dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "If you like this dress that much, then when we get off the hill, I'll ask my dad to buy you an exact one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even if I can't buy one, I'll ask Daddy to find someone to make one that&rsquo;s the same.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. Didn't you say you were going to get me a purple dress? I'll just wait for your purple dress!" Then, she mumbled, "However, I won't take it if it's too ugly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The purple dress&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was now standing in front of a wardrobe, looking at the purple dress with the same tiny flowers on the hem as that dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this dress was naturally much more delicate than the dress the little girl wore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his hand and gently touched the dress. Every year for years, he made a purple dress. They were of different styles, but the only thing that stayed the same was the little flowers on the dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because &lsquo;she&rsquo; liked these little flowers.</p></div>
