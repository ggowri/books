        <h1>Chapter 3109</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one expected that a production team that invested billions would suddenly announce its suspension and dissolution overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this matter cannot even make it to any trending topics, everything is happening only in private.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, any online content related to this production team is being blocked, as if the team never existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the main leaders of the production team are all very worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The producer made a distress call, but all they received was rejection. In frustration, they fiercely threw their phone to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on here? Can someone explain?" asked the producer. "How did our crew offend the prince? Why is he targeting this drama?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, even if they can really produce this drama, it's likely that it won't be able to air, and no one in the industry will be willing to buy it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The director's expression was equally unpleasant, and he himself looked puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, the assistant director nervously explained the general idea of the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The producer was shocked when he heard this, "Are you saying that just because one of our assistants dragged a woman who fell down, our crew is being targeted by the prince?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes...yes!" said the assistant director. "That woman seems to have a close relationship with the prince. The prince looks very nervous around her, as if she were his girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the assistant director said this, he himself felt a bit incredulous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That woman, dressed plainly and with an unremarkable appearance... um, it doesn't seem likely that she could be the prince's girlfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing these words, the producer's expression suddenly changed, "Girlfriend?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't think so, I just said it without thinking," the assistant director quickly explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait, if she really is the prince's girlfriend..." the producer said anxiously. He had heard rumors that the prince's girlfriend had disappeared due to an accident, and the prince had been searching for her all year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the name of his girlfriend has become a taboo topic among ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he had heard from someone familiar with the name of the Crown Prince's girlfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have you... Have you heard the name of that woman that the Crown Prince was shouting?" said the producer with a slightly trembling voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like they shouted 'Valda', or a word with similar syllables," said the assistant director.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The producer suddenly felt a chill down his spine. Valda... that's the name of the prince's girlfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, you're saying that this woman is really the prince's woman?!</p></div>
