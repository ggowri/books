        <h1>Chapter 4101</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If we have a baby, I'll definitely be a good mom!" Tina smiled and turned to Chandler. "And I'm sure you'll be a great dad too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her smile made Chandler's heart skip a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they really had a child and she could forgive everything that happened before, he would be so happy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So happy that it almost felt unreal!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back in Emerald City, everything was normal for Chandler, but Tina had a new job - asking about Chandler's health every day, as if afraid he would get sick again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler was a little uncomfortable with this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine, really," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, that day, you were really drugged by someone with bad intentions?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it was the parasites in my body," he hesitated for a moment, then spoke with determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Gu worms?" She was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pursed his lips tightly, considering how to say it, "Do you remember the portrait of an ancient woman in the church that day? She was a woman loved by Hunter's ancestor, but also cursed Hunter's family with Gu poison because of love!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler began to reveal Hunter's secrets to Tina, which should have been told to her after marriage or even after having children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he told her in advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Tina listened, her eyes widened, as if she were listening to some incredible fairy tale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is just too unbelievable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you still have Gu worms in your body now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, if we have sex, it can suppress the activity of the Gu worms and calm them down?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the past, every time the Gu worms were about to attack, you went back to Hunter's family to soak in the medicinal bath to calm them down? And the black lines on your body were also caused by the Gu worms?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them asked and answered each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler was unusually nervous. If she found him disgusting because of the Gu worms in his body and hated him for it, what should he do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Tina said, "Wow, the Gu worms are so lustful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her words instantly dissolved his nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But if that's the case, it's easy to handle in the future. If you feel uncomfortable, we can just sleep together for a night!" She said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You really are..." He couldn't help but laugh. It seemed that whenever he was with her, any negative emotions would disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Perhaps that's why he wanted to stay by her side even more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The Stephenson couple's faces changed when they found out their daughter had visited the Hunter family estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina asked worriedly about what happened, while Hadwin was almost ready to scold their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you know how dangerous it is? Are you treating what your father did for Hunter as a joke? What if Hunter wants to do something to you? What will you do?" Hadwin said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He felt blood rushing to his head at the thought of his daughter being in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm safe, aren't I?" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Did Hunter do anything to you?" Hadwin asked irritably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Well...actually, he did! She was trapped in that church overnight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she couldn't say that now!</p></div>
