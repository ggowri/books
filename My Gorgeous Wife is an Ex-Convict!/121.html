        <h1>Chapter 120</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace silently studied the nurse's actions from start to finish. Her expression did not change even when she saw the nasty wound on her palm.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only when the nurse was rebandaging Grace's right hand with gauze did she unwittingly frown at the pain, but she did not cry out loud.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let me do it. Get out," Jason ordered the nurse.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The nurse bowed out of the room respectfully. Jason took the gauze and bandaged Grace's right hand in a very practiced manner. His movements were so gentle and careful that she could barely feel any pain in her hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he was done bandaging, he put down the gauze. "Try to use your right hand as little as possible for the next few days. Don't clench your hand into a fist like you did just now. How much more blood do you want to lose?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She studied the dressing that he had done and noticed that the knot was tied very prettily. "You seem to be very practiced in bandaging wounds."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Shadows flashed through his eyes rapidly. "I learned some bandaging skills when I was young," he said, then thought to himself, "Back then, Dad was running around looking for Mom, and sometimes when he noticed someone with a similar silhouette, he would rush forward and stop them. He got beaten up a lot because of that.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And I always helped Dad dress his wounds. I got pretty skilled at it after a long enough time.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ever since Dad died, I haven't bandaged someone like this. She is the only one."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Next time, don't hold shards of mirror in your hand. You were lucky this time to not have damaged your nerves. If you had, your hand would be crippled," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace bit her lip. "But if I hadn't done what I did last night, I wouldn't have been able to retain consciousness and would have fainted, then... he would have been free to do what he wanted."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Does it hurt?" he asked. "The scene I saw after barging in last night of her clutching the shard and bleeding incessantly has been deeply imprinted on my mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I have never seen a woman using such willpower to hold onto her consciousness. Even if her mental faculties were in a confused and semi-conscious state, her willpower was still strong enough for her to keep herself awake."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's fine." She lowered her gaze gently. "This amount of pain is nothing to me. Jay, do you know? Even if you lied to me... I'm still very grateful that you saved me yesterday. Back when I was in jail, no matter how much I begged or pleaded, no one was willing to let me go because I had offended someone I shouldn't have in Emerald City. Thus, all of the pain was what I deserved."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She paused to take a deep breath and continued, "But last night was different. When I was in pain, you came and it made me feel like I was not so lonely and helpless."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She replied softly but she did not notice that his expression had imperceptibly turned grave at her words.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If there is anything that I regret in this life, it must be letting those people hurt her in jail all those years ago.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Usually, I wouldn't care about the pain a woman went through in jail. Even if they died in there, I would just smile faintly at the news.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And yet now, I don't want her to be hurt in the slightest."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm sorry," he mumbled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She raised her gaze and looked at him confusedly. "Why are you apologizing? If you hadn't come last night, I wouldn't be safe and sound now."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought that he was apologizing for last night's incident. "If he hadn't come last night, then my fate... it's obvious what would have happened.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I would have been imprisoned in the Miller residence until I gave birth to a child for the Miller family." As the idea occurred to her, her face unwittingly paled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then she spoke to him as if she had mustered all of her courage. "The person I offended was Jason. Back then, the Stevens family was afraid that I would implicate the Stevens Group, so Sean broke up with me. Now that you're helping me, what if it angers Jason...?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I think he might be one of those rich people and probably has some business dealings with the Reed family. After all, the Reed family is involved in providing the basic necessities of many residents of Emerald City. Some industries have even been monopolized by the Reed family. Therefore, Emerald City is sometimes jokingly referred to as the Reed family's city."</p></div>
