        <h1>Chapter 307</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin then took out a crumpled yellow piece of paper from his chest pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Written on it were the words, 'I'm sorry. I have to leave first'.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the piece of paper she had left back then. He had been carrying it with him all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several times, in anger, he crumpled up the paper and threw it into the trash can. However, he would go through the trash can and retrieve it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This piece of paper was like a thorn in his heart. He could not pull it out and was reluctant to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the only thing she had left for him. If he did not have that, then he would not have anything of hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now... Now, he had found her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina... Lina..." He muttered her name over and over, and his thin lips kissed the paper in his hand. He looked so attached to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina followed Grace into Jason's car and said to them, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lightly said, "I'll take you back first. Where do you live?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hastened to tell him her address. Grace, still somewhat worried, asked, "That Hadwin didn&rsquo;t do anything to you, did he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He just made me sit in a chair and stare at him for three hours," Lina said. "I wanted to call you, but he took my phone so I don't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of her phone, she suddenly remembered that her phone was still in Hadwin's hand! She had some work information on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina began to stress at the thought of this. Should she approach Hadwin to get her phone back or just consider it lost? That seemed to be the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing." Lina shook her head and looked at Jason who was driving at the front. She was amazed that she could ride in Jason's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew Jason would come to her rescue because of Grace. "Sorry I made you worry." She looked at her friend with a guilty face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What matters is you're all right," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car pulled up to the gate of Lina's neighborhood, Lina got off the car. Grace took the initiative to get back into the passenger seat, looking at Jason as she said, "Thank you for helping me today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned to look at her. The moonlight fell on her face through the window, still as calm as water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been so anxious because of Lina earlier as if she would do just about anything for Lina, even her remaining dignity could be thrown away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just because... Lina was her lifeline?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I were in danger one day, will you be willing to kneel to save me?" "Jason asked softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His slightly hoarse voice surrounded her ear and made her tremble a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes looked into his dark, inky eyes, and for a moment, she subconsciously wanted to say yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her reason immediately stopped her. What was the matter with her? Would people like Jason get in danger?</p></div>
