        <h1>Chapter 2296</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, I must be in love with Martin Weiss. I once regarded Martin Weiss as the person I loved most, but then I regarded Martin Weiss as the person I hated most.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After everything that had happened, she thought she could neither love nor hate him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, somehow, she fell for him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not be upset if she did not love him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... they were not right for each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, don't you think it's a pity to just separate like that?" Grace asked seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said bitterly, "Grace, what I hope now is that... Martin Weiss can live a good life." If they were together, perhaps she would one day drag him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If her health broke down one day because of her liver, what choice would he make then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was suddenly afraid to think about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said nothing after that. She only drank the glass of water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not ask any more questions. She knew that perhaps what Kyla needed most was not others persuading her but to calm down in peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, Kyla finally looked up at Grace and explained, "I didn't know where to go after leaving the hospital. I was afraid my mom might overthink if I went home, so... I came here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "You can come here anytime you want. Kyla, I told you I&rsquo;ll support you no matter what decision you make. It's just that..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice paused. "Are you sure you won't regret leaving Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head, took a deep breath, and said, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she had made up her mind, she... would not regret it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides... there was no room for her to regret it now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I've been bothering you long enough. I'm going home," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me take you home," Grace said and drove Kyla back to the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla found Neal Reid waiting at the store&rsquo;s entrance when she got down from the car. He hurried over as soon as he saw her and said, "Miss Corbyn, I beg you to go to the detention center to visit Jacqueline Bowman. She... She has something to tell you! You have nothing to lose anyway, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Neal Reid, who rushed over, and subconsciously took two steps back. Grace took a lunge forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Kyla was pregnant. Things might get serious if she was bumped into.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expression on Neal Reid's face became more bitter as soon as he saw Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to Jacqueline Bowman, he was now in trouble with not only the Weiss family but also the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Reed, I... I mean no harm. I just want to ask Miss Corbyn... Uh... Mrs. Weiss to go to the detention center and see Jacqueline Bowman. She has something important to say to Mrs. Weiss. Jacqueline Bowman says that Mrs. Weiss will regret it if she doesn&rsquo;t go!"</p></div>
