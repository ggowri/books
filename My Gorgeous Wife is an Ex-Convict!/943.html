        <h1>Chapter 942</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean panicked and immediately said, "Master Reed, it's just a misunderstanding. Zoe is young and immature, so please forgive her." Then, he shouted at Zoe who was still on the ground looking stunned, "Apologize!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe felt so aggrieved! 'I got slapped, yet I still have to apologize!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I have to admit defeat because I'm facing Jason. After all, the Stevens family is nothing compared to Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I got the news that Grace has moved out of Reed Residence and is living in a small rental house, so Jason must have dumped her. Why is... Jason defending Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was it&hellip; Jason who brought Grace to the banquet today?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe was full of doubts, but no one gave her the answers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got up awkwardly and was about to apologize when Grace said, "No thanks. I don't need her apology."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe was stunned. 'What does that mean? I was about to apologize, but she...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's true. Sis doesn't need the apology," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sis?' Sean was surprised. He had heard Jason address Grace like that a long time ago. Later on, it seemed that Jason and Grace began dating each other and he never heard Jason call her that again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now... What does this mean?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean was also full of doubts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe was even more embarrassed now. At first, she just wanted to apologize and leave, but now that she could not make an apology, she could only stand there with a red and swollen face while receiving strange gazes from all around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This made her extremely miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily came forward and said, "Although Miss Cummins said there&rsquo;s no need to apologize, it was Zoe's fault after all. How about this? Why don't the Stevens family donate money to the children in the disaster area under your name, Miss Cummins? What do you think of that, Miss Cummins?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily's approach helped Zoe solve the awkward problem of apologizing and gave the Stevens family a good reputation. Both parties would benefit from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe was eager to agree. 'It's just spending some money. It's better than keeping me here awkwardly!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her gaze to the tray in Jason's hand. "Is that for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about yours?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I ate some earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two chatted like no one else was there, treating Lily and the Stevens siblings like they were invisible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily's expression changed immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one dared to ignore her, the second daughter of the Atkinson family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then eat first. Put some food into your stomach," said Jason, placing the tray of food on a nearby table as he sat down with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other three stayed put.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? How long do you plan to stand there?" Jason asked lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean then hurriedly left with Lily and Zoe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three were not in the mood to stay at the banquet anymore. They had become a laughing stock. Staying around would only embarrass them further.</p></div>
