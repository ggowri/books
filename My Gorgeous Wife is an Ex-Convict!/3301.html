        <h1>Chapter 3299</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Jasper returned to the Reed House, he locked himself in his room and finally had a good cry all by himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jason returned to the house, he learned from the driver what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he arrived at the door of his daughter's room, lightly knocked on the door, and after waiting for a moment without a response, he opened the door and entered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as I pushed the door open, I heard my daughter crying "wuwuwu".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of crying made Jason frown and feel a strong sense of heartache in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the children, Jasper is the daughter and also the one who resembles Grace the most. Therefore, she is the most beloved. At this moment, seeing his daughter cry, he naturally feels full of heartache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason approached and spoke softly, "Tell Daddy, why are you crying? Is it because the Abbott family used you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's body stiffened and he lifted his head to look at his father. His almond-shaped eyes were filled with tears, which made Jason feel even more heartbroken. He regretted his actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If I had known it would turn out like this, maybe I should have lied and said that I couldn't find Lawrence in the first place. Then my daughter would have been disappointed at most, instead of feeling so sad and crying like she is now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't cry. Tell Daddy what you want, and it will happen just the way you want it to," said Jason. He promised to make his daughter's wishes come true, no matter what they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper sniffled and cried out, "Daddy, I...I don't want to see Lawrence anymore. I don't want to see his parents either. They just want money, so they're using me and our family. I...I hate this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Jason gently embraced his daughter and said, "Okay, from now on, Daddy won't let you see them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why...why are they doing this? I always thought Lawrence was my good friend, but he was only nice to me...because he wanted to please me and help his family make more money..." Jasper buried his face in his father's chest, his shoulders shaking with sobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason's eyes flickered slightly. Although he felt that Lawrence was trying to please his daughter, he believed that he was sincere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, since his daughter doesn't want to see Lawrence anymore, he doesn't think it's necessary to say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, with parents like Lawrence's, he doesn't want his daughter to have too much involvement with the Abbott family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are many children who play the piano well, so even from my daughter's perspective, it may be difficult to find someone she truly appreciates. However, this does not mean that we cannot find someone of her age who plays the piano well and can impress her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Lawrence is missing, then we just need to find someone else to substitute for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason gently stroked his daughter's head and said, "Because you are Jasper, they want to please you and gain more benefits. Jasper, as a member of the Reed family, you are Jasper. In the future, more people will want to please you and gain more benefits through pleasing you. This has been destined since your birth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper paused for a moment, then lifted his head with teary eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason took a tissue from the side and carefully wiped his daughter's tears. "So, in the future when you make friends, you need to be more careful in observing their character and make sure that they are truly worth being close friends with."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These were things he had planned to tell his daughter in two years' time. Although he had consciously guided her before, he had never expressed it so clearly before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... how can I be sure?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After you grow up, you will gradually understand how to make decisions," said Jason. "But Daddy wants to tell you that before you make a decision, you shouldn't easily confide in others, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does it mean that you cannot speak your mind to the other person?"</p></div>
