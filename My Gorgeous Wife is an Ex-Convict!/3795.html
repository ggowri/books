        <h1>Chapter 3793</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's gaze sharpened, and he seemed to be suppressing something in his chest as he said, "Since I've chosen to break up, there's nothing left to say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does Mason really not care? Or is it because he cares too much and is afraid, so he chose to break up?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's body tensed up. "What are you talking about?!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you afraid that you'll suffer again for Veronica? Afraid that you won't be able to bear the pain and hypnotize yourself again?" William continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's face became ugly, and his hands on the table kept tightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But William seemed oblivious and continued, "Is hypnosis really effective? Mason, you came back this time and reunited with Veronica, and you started dating her so quickly. That can only mean that you really love her. Even if you hypnotize yourself again, maybe you'll still fall in love with her again in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you said enough?" Mason said darkly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to speak some truth to Mason. After all, I love Jasper and understand what it's like to love someone. And..." William's voice paused, "I've never really believed that hypnosis is effective. If you're meant to love someone, you'll love them. Uncle Weiss hypnotized himself before, but in the end, he got back together with Auntie Corbyn. So..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason stared at William as he said, "Hypnotizing emotions may just be self-deception!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason fell silent, and he even forgot when William left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Self-deception? Was his determined hypnosis, forgetting all the feelings between him and her, just a self-deception in the end?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if it wasn't, then why did he fall in love with Veronica again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be because...it was destined for him to fall in love with her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Mason returned to the Reed family, he saw that his parents were already at home and clearly waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to the study. Your mother wants to ask you something," Jason Reed said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason followed his parents into the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace looked at her second son and always felt that she owed Mason the most among her children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Mason was taken away by Secretary Wylie, she only knew a little about his life before the age of three from Secretary Wylie's mouth, but even that caused her great pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Mason's life with the Barlow family was not good either. If it weren't for Veronica protecting Mason at a young age, his childhood would have been even more difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterwards, Mason stayed with the Barlow family for a long time, and after breaking with Veronica, he went abroad to study. It can be said that he spent very little time with the Reed family. As a mother, she hardly took care of this child, and sometimes didn't even know where to start to be good to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You put Daniel in the hospital?" Jason asked first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," Mason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened? You're not an impulsive person," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing, I just didn't like him," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it was just that you didn't like him, you would have been too lazy to bother with him. That day he took Veronica to the hospital, and you went there and had a conflict. What did you say at the time? Was it related to Veronica or to the three of you back then?" Jason asked incisively.</span></p></div>
