        <h1>Chapter 4396: Those Disgusting Rumors</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only acted this way to avoid those who love to gossip!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought that the two people talking would </span><span>actually stop</span><span> in their tracks and start chatting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, Calvert is good-looking, but in this circle, there are plenty of handsome men. It's only natural that the eldest princess of the Hart family would get bored. Over the past couple of years, Calvert has also benefited quite a bit from his association with the Hart family's eldest princess!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, otherwise how could he have become the leading man in several shows so quickly? And all the shows he's in are hits!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must be pretty good in bed, huh? Otherwise, why would the princess be so into him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words are becoming more and more unbearable to hear!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley could only feel a surge of anger welling up!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people, they always just rely on their preconceived notions to make assumptions, only caring about their own satisfaction of speaking out, without any intention of seeking the truth. They don't even care about how their words might hurt others!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Harley was about to teach those two a lesson, he suddenly heard one of them say, "But now that Calvert has been abandoned by Harley, there are quite a few people who have their sights set on him!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, everyone wants to know, what it feels like to be the man who caught Princess Hart's eye."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way, today Miss. Maldonado is throwing a feast, under the guise of film investment, and she's invited Calvert as the male lead. She's planning to take Calvert for all he's worth!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Maldonado is already over 40, isn't she? Even if Calvert was dumped by Princess Hart, would he be willing?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's there to be unwilling about? In this industry, if you want to get ahead, you need a backer. Besides, even if Calvert isn't willing, his agent said they could drug him, and then... well, you know..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Harley heard the words "drugged", his head buzzed, almost as if it was about to explode!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instinctively, he rushed forward, grabbing the person who first shared this news, "What did you just say? Miss. Maldonado is planning to drug Calvert? To force him into submission?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment those two saw Harley suddenly appear, their faces turned pale with fright. The man whose collar was grabbed by </span><span>Harley,</span><span> his face turned even more ghostly white.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn</span><span>, what are the odds that this guy would overhear that?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... I was just joking, you know. What I said earlier, you can't take it seriously!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me the truth, if anything happens to Calvert tonight, do you believe me when </span><span>I say I'll leave you with nothing? I mean what I say!" Harley said sternly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those eyes, usually so gentle, were now filled with a fierce intensity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I only heard about it when I was chatting with Miss. Maldonado, I... I don't know if Miss. Maldonado would </span><span>actually do</span><span> it!" The other person's voice trembled as they spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there's no need to get on the wrong side of this princess over such a trivial matter!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know where Miss. Maldonado and Calvert are having dinner tonight?" Harley asked again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other party quickly gave an address.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Harley thought, it's not too far from here, but it's not close either. It would probably take about 20 minutes to drive there!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let go of the other person while dialing Calvert's number. But to her surprise, she was informed that his phone was switched off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley frowned, feeling increasingly uneasy.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually at this time, Calvert's phone wouldn't be off. Does this mean he's really in trouble now?!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to turn and bolt from the meeting, suddenly a hand grabbed hers!</span></p></div>
