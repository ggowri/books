        <h1>Chapter 3800</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she didn't exist in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't love you anymore," Mason heard himself say. Yes, as long as he had enough time, as long as he left Emerald City and stayed away from her for a while, he could adjust his state of mind before they met again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could not love her, treat her as a stranger, he could do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really don't love me, then why is this pendant still hanging on your phone?" Veronica suddenly took Mason's phone out of his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he answered the phone in the car earlier, she saw the cat paw couple pendant they had chosen together still hanging on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, his phone was in her hand, and the cat paw pendant was shaking, as if proving something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just forgot to take it off," Mason said, taking his phone back from her hand and taking the cat paw pendant off his phone. "Now, can you believe what I said earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cat paw pendant fell from his hand to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica stared at the cat paw pendant, her body trembling, her face turning pale, feeling like she was falling into an endless abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How happy she was when she bought this pendant, and now, she was probably as desperate as she could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so painful to be abandoned by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did she abandon the pendant, but she also abandoned him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This... is the second time he has abandoned her, but she doesn't want to cry so embarrassingly in front of him. She doesn't want the last impression he has of her to be her ugly crying face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they really can't salvage the relationship and have to break up, she still hopes they can keep the good parts of their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica took a deep breath, wiped away her tears, and forced a smile. "Okay, I understand. I promise you, we'll break up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it sounded calm, it took almost all her strength to say it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of light flashed through his cold and indifferent eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just... one last request. This time, can we break up peacefully? I won't bother you again in the future, so can you please not hypnotize me again?" Her voice trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to leave nothing behind after the breakup. She didn't want to be just a symbol in his memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least she hoped that in his heart, there could be a small place for their relationship. Even if it was small, it didn't matter. At least it represented that they had once existed, and that this relationship could continue to exist in his emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason remained silent and didn't answer her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air seemed to be filled with a suffocating oppression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed by second by second, but Mason still didn't answer Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her last bit of hope was slowly shattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica forced out, "Um... what I said earlier was just a hope. If... if you don't want to, it's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had the right to make the decision, and she didn't have the right to interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay?" Mason felt a pang in his heart as he watched Veronica bow her head, restraining himself from reaching out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't this the situation he wanted? She had already accepted the breakup proposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason silently left Veronica's apartment.</span></p></div>
