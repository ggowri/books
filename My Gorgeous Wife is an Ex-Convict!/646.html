        <h1>Chapter 645</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Angel&hellip;' Jason's eyelashes quivered a little. Maybe she was like an angel to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She saved him from the abyss when he was so numb that he did not know what the meaning of survival was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without her, he would only be living a meaningless life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think, Jay?" asked Grace. She looked at herself in the mirror after trying it on and just did not feel like herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it was not the official wedding dress, it was so beautiful that it made her sigh. Maybe every girl had an obsession with wedding dresses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered seeing a bride wearing a wedding dress as a child and thought that her dress was beautiful. Then, she wondered when she would be able to wear such a dress and if a fairytale prince would come to hold her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now... She had really met her prince!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason as he approached her. He was wearing a crisp suit that outlined his tall, lean body. His broad shoulders, narrow waist, and long legs made him look good in anything. Even the simplest clothes would look good on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His defined face and delicate features made people find him good-looking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Beautiful," those sexy thin lips whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think it's beautiful too," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not talking about the dress. I'm talking about you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face suddenly turned red. Was he... Sweet talking? She used to think that men who sweet-talked were frivolous. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when the words came out of his mouth, it made people blush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? You look so pure and innocent right now. It's as if you're going to arouse human's deepest desires." He bent down, moved his lips close to her ear, and said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, "I want to rob you of everything and keep you stuck by my side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I... Even want to break your wings so that you can't go anywhere.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt as if her heart was about to leap from her throat. It was clearly a tyrannical statement, but somehow, she felt a gush of sweetness in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe... She was already stuck by his side because she loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Hadwin frowned and looked at the bridesmaid dress Lina was wearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Isn't it nice?" Lina even turned around in front of Hadwin. She thought the dress looked good. She was even going to tell the designer to just adjust some details before she chose it to be her official bridesmaid dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's too revealing," said Hadwin. He found the dress offensive to the eye, especially at the thought of her wearing it to the wedding dinner as the maid of honor.</p></div>
