        <h1>Chapter 354</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thinking of..." She suddenly shuddered, her eyes staring straight at the person in front of her. Come to think of it, Hadwin was now the patriarch of the Stephenson family. He would of course have his contacts and connections. If Hadwin would help her investigate Grace's case, it would be easier to get some useful leads. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, the light in her eyes got brighter. She looked at Hadwin like she was looking at a freshly baked bun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I know I did you wrong and I admit to everything you said. I promise I'll do whatever you want, but... can you do me a little favor while we're dating?" Lina looked at him expectantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A favor?" Hadwin was a little surprised. "What 'little favor' do you want me to do for you?" Judging by her brown-nosing look, it was probably not that little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, my friend Grace, the one who came to find me with Jason the other day&hellip; She was wrongly convicted of a crime and spent three years in prison, but she was actually wronged. We just never found evidence to help her reverse the case. There have been some clues lately. Can you please follow these clues and see if you can find anything that will help reverse the case?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin did not expect that her favor was to help Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's on good terms with Jason. Why is it that instead of asking Jason for help to reverse the case, she asked you to go through so much trouble?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, Grace doesn't know I&rsquo;m asking you for help. She didn't ask Jason because..." Lina paused. After all, it was her best friend's private matter, and Jason's current relationship with her best friend was quite complicated. She ended up saying, "I don't think she would want to ask Jason for help with the case. After all, she was claimed to have been drunk driving and killed Jason's fianc&eacute;e, Jennifer Atkinson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin narrowed his eyes and suddenly chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you laughing at?" Lina frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just thought their relationship was kind of interesting," Hadwin said with a smile. "However, since the judge ruled your friend to have killed someone because she was drunk driving, why do you think she was wronged?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sure Grace won't lie. She said she didn&rsquo;t drink that day and it was Jennifer Atkinson's car that rushed toward her. Since she said so, then that must be the case," Lina said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The curve at the corners of Hadwin's mouth gradually began to vanish, and his eyes began to darken. "Do you trust her that much?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's my best friend. If I don't trust her, who should I trust?" Lina said matter-of-factly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about me? Do you believe me?" Hadwin asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. What did he mean by this question? Was he not going to get even with her? How could she trust him with no reservations?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did, she would probably end up being tortured into bits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, of course, she could not answer that in the presence of Hadwin, so she quickly answered, "Yes, of course, I trust you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her, almost as if he was trying to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, he lowered his lashes to hide the flash of disappointment in his eyes. "All right, you can hand me the clues you have later. I'll have someone look it up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? Thank you so much!" Lina said, overjoyed. Her hands went straight across the table and excitedly took Hadwin's hands. "I knew you're a good guy. You can't go back on your words, all right?"</p></div>
