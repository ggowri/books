        <h1>Chapter 1726</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was so caught off guard that she managed to pull him into the back seat and had him press himself on top of her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The smell of alcohol mixed with her own scent rushed into his nose, making him fall into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson... Why... Why did you show up again?" muttered Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stiffened. 'Does she know that this intimacy and the way she&rsquo;s holding him brings me devastating pain?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... He did not want to push her away. He only wanted her to hold him longer. He could bear the pain as long as she would continue to hold him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Because I miss you so much," muttered Hadwin Stephenson. He answered her anyway, even though he knew she would probably forget whatever he said when she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss... Miss me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I miss you so much..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But... do you know how much I want to get over... you?" There seemed to be a lump in her throat and she finally broke into a small sob.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes darkened a little. "I know." He knew this all too well. "I'll leave after bringing you upstairs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He tried to get up as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her hands grasped the hem of his shirt firmly, refusing to let go. "You... You haven't drunk, played the finger guessing game with me, and... danced for me yet!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you tell this to me when you're sober, I'll do it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm... Hiccup... I&rsquo;m sober..." she gave him a big smile as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes darkened. If she were sober, she would probably <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>never smile at him like this, nor be so close to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, let go, or you'll regret it," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm not letting go!" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He pressed his lips together and made up his mind. He pulled her hand away from the hem of his shirt, getting up to get her out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She obediently followed him out of the car while pressing herself against his body. However, just as he bent over to pick her up, she pushed him into the car with both hands. The next moment, her body was pressed onto him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two collapsed into the back seat again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was different this time&mdash;she was on top of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina! Do you know what you're doing?" he shouted. He soon realized that he had asked a silly question. How could she possibly know when she was so intoxicated?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes... Yes..." She mumbled as her fingers stroked his face, teasing his heart again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, I want to... get over you... you..." As she finished speaking, her lips kissed his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was talking about getting over him but was kissing him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina... What on earth do you want?" he asked hoarsely, and the response he got was another lingering kiss...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina slept in the back seat of the car.</p></div>
