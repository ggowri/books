        <h1>Chapter 3588</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Jasper didn't know if she could be happy again. Lawrence's situation was like a pain that she couldn't erase from her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this lifetime, could she still find Lawrence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she couldn't find him, could she still be happy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Jasper went to the chemistry department again and found Roger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can we find a place to talk?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her with a deep gaze and after a moment, he said, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them walked to a secluded place on campus, and Jasper finally stopped and turned to face him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger was quite tall, over 180 centimeters, with a slender figure and a handsome face that gave off a good feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sunlight filtered through the treetops and fell on his face. He had short black hair, a full forehead, a straight nose, and thin lips with a water-like hue. However, what was most attractive about him were his eyes - beautiful and flawless, like a gorgeous obsidian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the image of Lawrence that she had imagined he would grow up to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But no matter how much she imagined, reality was like a bucket of cold water poured over her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry?" he raised an eyebrow. "Why are you suddenly apologizing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You were angry that day at the welfare home, right?" Jasper said. "Because I always treated you as Lawrence and made you uncomfortable. But from now on, there won't be such a thing. I won't treat you as Lawrence anymore, and I won't do anything that makes you dislike me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, her words made his brows furrow involuntarily. "What do you mean by that?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just what I said," Jasper said. "I won't impose my subjective will on you anymore, and I'll try not to bother you. As for the unpleasant things I caused you before, I'm sorry and I hope you can forgive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if I don't forgive you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was stunned, looking at Roger in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly gave a cold laugh, "Jasper, in this world, not everything can be forgiven. There are always some things that are unforgivable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's expression darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, in this world, there are always some things that are unforgivable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Lawrence were in front of her right now, would he forgive her? Probably not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of her impulsive decision to end their friendship, because she didn't lend a helping hand when he needed it the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, what do I have to do for you to forgive me?" Jasper asked, looking up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Date me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" She looked completely shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Date me, and then I'll forgive you for mistaking me for Lawrence all this time," Roger said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's impossible!" she exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there anything wrong with it?" he said with a half-smile. "I think I'm not bad-looking, and besides, you don't have a boyfriend now, and I don't have a girlfriend either. If we date, is there anything taboo?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper frowned. "I just think that dating shouldn't be treated as a condition for a transaction! The two people who date should at least like each other!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I like you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Huh? She was stunned, only hearing him say, "Haven't I been saying that I like you and want to date you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at him blankly, and he was looking at her at the same time.</p></div>
