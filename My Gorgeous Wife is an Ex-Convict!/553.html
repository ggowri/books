        <h1>Chapter 552</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At least that job makes me feel like I can support myself," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glistened as he heard this. Then, he smiled and said, "I'll take you to work today." As he spoke, he kissed her on the forehead, then pulled back the covers before getting out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Grace let out a low cry and subconsciously turned away. She... Saw it. She saw it just now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her shy appearance made him smile. He only found it extremely cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, don't you like it?" He turned around, his hands resting on either side of her thin quilt while his warm breath sprinkled over her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face turned red. He was so close that it made her a little confused about where to look. "Yes... I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you sorry for?" He raised his hand and took hers, letting it touch the skin before his chest. "You touched here yesterday, and you saw it too, didn't you? You love me and I love you, so it's only natural for you to look at me. Unless you find me unattractive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course not!" She objected instinctively, and her face turned even redder as she said it. God, what was she talking about? It was true, but it was so&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The palm of her hand was full of his temperature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There you go. Will you look at me more, Grace? I like it when you look at me," he muttered in an affectionate voice. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was like a tantalizing music string and she could not stop herself from being tantalized by him. Her eyes then fell on his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body was beautiful as if it was a work of art.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled, straightening himself up again. He began to change his clothes in front of her. Though even as he did so, his eyes remained fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not take her eyes off him as they met his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time he had finished changing, her face was completely red. Then, he took her clothes out of the closet and gently helped her change into them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I can change myself," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I like helping you. It makes you seem more dependent on me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked. "Why do you always want me to depend on you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because the more you depend on me, the more you'll hate to leave me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips together. Now he was crouching before her on his knees, helping her to put on her socks. His movements were so gentle and natural that they were nothing like what outsiders portrayed him as.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, Grace would have felt that a man like Jason should be confident and proud as if he liked to be in control of everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, however, she always vaguely felt as if he was insecure. Even when they were together, he was always afraid that she would leave, would not love him, would not forgive him, or something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was a man like him insecure? Was it because of his mother? Was he insecure because his mother had betrayed his father?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because his mother had cast a shadow over him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like the scar that was still visible on his chest, he once told her that his mother had pushed him away as she was leaving him and that the wound nearly killed him.</p></div>
