        <h1>Chapter 1472</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the doctor and nurses left, Grace looked at Jason who was still standing in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stood not far from the bedside and seemed to be surrounded by loneliness and despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace pressed her lips together and said, "After the babies are born, I... want to move out of Reed Residence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason immediately looked up at her with astonishment and panic on his face. "You want to... move out of Reed Residence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "Yeah. It's because I don't know how to face you. Maybe moving out of Reed Residence will be better for both of us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could have given a lot of excuses to justify his behavior then. For example, she could have said that he did not really know her back then and she was just a nobody to him. How could he have sympathized with a nobody when he had always been indifferent? It would explain how he just looked on without getting involved...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could come up with more than one excuse but could not convince herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was brought up to believe in justice, which was why she chose to become a lawyer who would fight for righteousness and justice with the law as her weapon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the person she loved most had been so indifferent as to let her get wrongfully imprisoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That imprisonment almost changed her life. Perhaps only time could soothe... the pain and agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What do you mean by it's better for us? I&rsquo;ll never think that it&rsquo;d be better for us if you move out of Reed Residence!" said Jason as he quickly stepped forward and walked to the bedside. His hands subconsciously wanted to grab her but stopped when they were about to touch her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hands were only a few centimeters from her shoulders. If he moved just a little closer, he could have touched her. However, the short distance between them seemed like millions and millions of meters to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The image of her throwing up and the way her body had trembled were so vividly imprinted in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then, just assume that it&rsquo;s for my sake&hellip; After I discharge, I want to stay elsewhere. Help me look for a small apartment. Preferably somewhere near the hospital, so that it would be convenient for me to go for check-ups," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since she could not face him right now, then they should just both calm down first. What mattered most for her now was the babies in her belly. She must make sure that the babies come into the world safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, only one possibility occurred to him when she said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you planning to divorce me?" The hoarse voice came out of his mouth with a faint quiver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Di-Divorce?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not know how to face him but had never thought of a divorce. Did he know that the vulnerable look on his face when he said that made her heart clench?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The truth hurt her, even making her hate him for being so indifferent as to refuse to give the innocent her back then a little sympathy&mdash;all for the sake of money. However&hellip; he was the man she loved the most and the father of the babies in her belly, after all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had once said that she wanted to give her children a warm and wonderful family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... she had no idea how long it would take to get there now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I've never thought about a divorce," Grace said after a long while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her answer did not make him feel better. His eyes fell on her bulging belly. "Is it because of the babies? So you're not going to divorce me, but... you won't even look at me and live in the same place as me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I..." For a moment, she did not know how to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"In that case, you can live in Reed Residence. I'll move out. As for the matter of divorce, since you said you've never thought about it, don't ever think about it then."</p></div>
