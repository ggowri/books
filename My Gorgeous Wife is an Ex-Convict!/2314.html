        <h1>Chapter 2312</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know I'm giving you a hard time, so I came to try my luck. Is Martin Weiss here?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but Chairman Weiss is in a meeting right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you tell me where the meeting room is, then? I'll go there by myself. Didn't Martin Weiss ask you to help me with anything I want to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Kyla said made all the words that Mallory Malcom wanted to say get stuck in his throat. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He scratched his head in resignation. "But if Chairman Weiss gets angry when he sees you, Mrs. Weiss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take care of everything. Tell him I forced you to tell me the place of the meeting," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Kyla had said so, Mallory Malcom could only say, "I'll take you there, then." Otherwise, he could not afford it if anything bad happened. Especially now that Kyla was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom led Kyla to the elevator not far away. The receptionist was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... did I just hear?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Mrs. Weiss? Who is she? She can't be Chairman Weiss's wife, can she?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The woman's obviously pregnant... If she's Mrs. Weiss, then she must be pregnant with Chairman Weiss's child.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The receptionist was taken aback by her own speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Mallory Malcom brought Kyla to the floor where the meeting room was on and said, "Chairman Weiss is still in a meeting, so I'm afraid you'll have to wait outside for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'll wait here." Kyla pointed to the lounge area outside the meeting room. It had small round tables and chairs, obviously intended for rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you like something to drink? Or something to eat?" asked Mallory Malcom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just give me a glass of warm water," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom replied in acknowledgment and brought a glass of warm water to Kyla moments later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took the water, held it in her palms, and said to Mallory Malcom, "I'll wait here. You can go back to do your work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." Mallory Malcom hesitated slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll stay right here. There are many people here watching if anything happens. Nothing will go wrong," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go back to work, then. Wait here for Chairman Weiss." Then, Mallory Malcom left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla sat quietly, sipping the glass of warm water in her hands as if that would make her less nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What will happen when I see Martin Weiss later?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could he have gotten over this relationship as Mallory Malcom said?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt herself growing more and more nervous as time ticked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the meeting room door opened. Kyla's hands that were holding the glass shook. Some water spilled out, but she did not seem to notice it as she stood up straight, her eyes fixed on the people walking out of the meeting room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A pregnant woman standing there looking straight at the meeting room door was attention-drawing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those coming out of the meeting room looked at Kyla.</p></div>
