        <h1>Chapter 2860</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so familiar it made her have the sudden urge to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's... Brian! He's here! He's really here! He'll save me! He'll save me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Li..." She opened her mouth with difficulty to call out to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was like a piece of driftwood that a drowning person like her desperately wanted to hold on to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, she saw him pick up the phone and seemingly listen to something. Then, his expression changed, and he turned around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, don't go!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian!" she shouted hoarsely with almost all her strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she shouted as hard as she could, she was drowned out by the noise around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he not hear me shout? Is he... leaving?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she saw him turn and look in her direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He... saw me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was delighted. If Brian was by her side, she would not have to be afraid... Brian would protect her. With him around...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her pupils soon shrank, and her face was filled with shock because she saw him turn around and hurry away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A sharp pain instantly attacked her, and tears poured out of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why? Why did he leave? He saw me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the security guards finally came over and helped stop Wynne as well as those causing a scene and smashing things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said to Valda Theller, "Valda, let's find a quiet place and clean you up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller stood blankly in the same spot as if she had lost her soul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda!" Camille Strickland raised her volume. "What's come over you? Don't frighten me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finally came to her senses and said bitterly, "Camille, take me... away..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, we're leaving immediately!" Camille Strickland hurriedly left the venue with Valda Theller under the security guards' escort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland drove Valda Theller back to the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you take a hot bath first? You're all sticky. You must be feeling uncomfortable," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded blankly, took a change of clothes, and went into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland looked sad. Who would have thought a book signing would end up like this? Valda did not show any emotion in the car, which worried her even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would have preferred Valda complain or swear on the road rather than being quiet like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Camille Strickland's phone rang. As soon as Camille Strickland answered it, she heard Raymond Bowman's anxious voice from her phone. "Camille Strickland, are you with Valda Theller now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if I am?" Camille Strickland asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How is she? Is she okay?" Raymond Bowman asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland frowned. "What do you mean?"</p></div>
