        <h1>Chapter 555</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Two more posters to go," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll do it." He took the phone in her hand and took photos of the two remaining posters before sending them to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of letting her do it, he should do it himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All done?" Grace was surprised at the speed at which he took the photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. It's just two posters. How long do you think it'll take?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the photos of the posters Jason had just sent to her best friend. Uh, they were a little out of alignment. She did not know whether Lina minded it. If she did, she would retake some later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened the photo album on her phone again and started looking through the pictures of her and Howell Webb that Jason took yesterday, thinking of choosing one to print. After all, it was a good memory to have a photo taken with your favorite celebrity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you still looking at these photos?" Big Boss Reed was not done being jealous over the incident earlier, and now, he was jealous again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to print one for my album," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is he that good-looking?" His voice had a tangy bitter tone to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was startled, then she looked up at Jason's clearly jealous face. Suddenly, she did not know whether to cry or laugh. Who would have guessed that the famous Young Master Reed was such a jealous guy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's pretty good looking, but..." With a change in tone, she added when his face clearly sunk. "He's not as good-looking as you. I think my Jason looks the best."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The &lsquo;my&rsquo; she said clearly seemed to please him. "Yours?" he asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, mine." Grace nodded, feeling as if her skin was getting thicker and thicker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chuckled, the jealousy immediately gone from his face. "I like to hear you say that. I'm yours, and you're mine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So stop being jealous! I only admire Howell Webb as a fan that... Uh, I'm not even the die-hard type. Besides him, I also have other celebrities I like. I appreciate the characters they portray in films, and I appreciate them without worrying or caring about them," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she put down her phone and lifted her hands to grab his face. "With you, it's different. I care about your feelings and I want to be with you forever. However, I never thought of spending my whole life with the celebrities I like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared hard at the person in front of him. She always seemed to make his uneasiness subside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't like you looking at him for too long. I'm not a generous man, Grace. Even if you simply admire him as an actor, it's not all right for me," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His domineering and monopolizing stance was so intense that he knew sometimes it could be suffocating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, as he said this, he was watching her reaction for fear that she would feel too restricted and dislike it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blinked and pursed her lips as if she was thinking about it. Then, she smiled and said, "All right, then I'll fangirl over celebrities once in a while, and Jay..."</p></div>
