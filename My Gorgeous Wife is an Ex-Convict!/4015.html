        <h1>Chapter 4013</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't talk about taking care of me. First, take care of your health. You still have a little one in your belly. If you're not healthy, how can you give birth to this little one?" Miss Fowler worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she didn't have much education, she understood some of the things the doctors said during their rounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They said that Nancy had too many injuries and it would be difficult to give birth to the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But because of her current condition, it would also be difficult to have an abortion. One wrong move could lead to various complications.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So that's why she kept delaying going to the clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will cooperate with the treatment and do everything I can to recover as soon as possible," Nancy promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Miss Fowler left the ward, Nancy lowered her eyes and looked at her swollen belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was transferred to this hospital with such fanfare and seen by so many top doctors in the county, she had a suspicion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only ones who could give her this kind of treatment in this unfamiliar city were the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did the Reed family know she was here and knew about her situation, so they offered to help?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a few days, perhaps the police in Emerald City would come here to ask her about her involvement in the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, would the Reed family know about her pregnancy? Would Mick know?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Nancy couldn't help but think of the time when Mick handed her birth control pills, his dark eyes full of indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, he made her take the birth control pills in front of him, just so he wouldn't have anything to do with her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This child was never what he hoped for!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he knew about her pregnancy, would he force her to have an abortion?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her child...was her only blood relative in this world, and she wanted to keep this child no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every time she thought of him, her heart still ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How much longer will it take to ease this pain? She closed her eyes and fell asleep unknowingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her sleep, she seemed to hear rapid breathing, and then... felt a cold and trembling hand touching her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who was touching her? Whose hand was it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She slowly opened her eyes, and moonlight streamed into the room through the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What she saw was the familiar handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he was different from the Mick she remembered. At this moment, there was a strange emotion on his face, as if he cared, as if he was concerned, and more like he had found hope in despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hand was trembling, gently stroking her face, as if he was afraid that a little more force would break her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His lips were also trembling, whispering her name, "Nancy... Nancy..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He kept calling her name over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was she dreaming?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was a Mick she had never seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It must be a dream, otherwise how could it be so unreal?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick..." Nancy murmured, struggling to lift her arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For her, even lifting her arm was extremely difficult at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she still wanted to touch him, even if it was only in her dreams!</p></div>
