        <h1>Chapter 1375</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three of them got into the car and went to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had been transferred to a regular ward. The hospital had provided Lina a VIP single room with a good environment and a bed for family. Usually, either Mr. Sweeney or Mrs. Sweeney would spend the night in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Lina was sitting quietly in her hospital bed. She had even straightened her hospital gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her head was still wrapped in thick white gauze. Her once pretty face looked pale and haggard from the days spent in the hospital and two major operations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney accompanied their daughter quietly. They knew their daughter was as stubborn as a mule in anything she wanted to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like when their daughter had given up the opportunity to further her studies and returned to the country without hesitation to save Grace. They had also sternly told her that they would disown her, but it did not work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since their daughter wanted to see Hadwin Stephenson, she had to see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door was pushed open. Grace and Jason walked in first, followed by Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's gaze immediately fixed on Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her perturbed expression immediately relaxed. 'He's standing right in front of me. He's alright. He's fine!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina took a deep breath and said, "Mom, Dad, Grace, and Mr. Reed, can you all go out for a moment? I want to talk to Hadwin about something in private."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was worried that Hadwin Stephenson would say something harsh to trigger her best friend, and for a moment, she hesitated whether to go out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, Jason said to Grace, "Let's go out first. I think President Stephenson knows what to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, don't worry about me!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Grace and Jason walked out of the ward together while Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney followed them hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason and said, "Are you sure nothing will go wrong? What if Hadwin Stephenson says something very heartless that triggers... Lina..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She dared not imagine it somehow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney hurriedly asked, "Has... Hadwin really gotten together with another woman? Is it just like what the news said? Is he here to make things clear and break up with Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, their daughter was now seriously injured. It was hard to say whether she would have any after-effects. Hadwin Stephenson was the patriarch of the Stephenson family and would probably have a bright future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They naturally thought Hadwin Stephenson had come to the conclusion that their daughter was not good enough for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not sure either. Maybe we'll find out after they talk it over," Grace said with a grim face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney could only wait with a worried face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason held Grace's hand and said to her, "What you fear probably won't happen. Hadwin Stephenson knows where the bottom line is. At the very least, he probably won&rsquo;t want anything to happen to Lina. You can even say that he's probably afraid of something happening to Lina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you know for sure?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he really didn't care about Lina, then he wouldn't have looked so nervous when I said Lina was in a coma and going to be a vegetable," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was also a man, so he naturally understood that an introverted and gloomy person like Hadwin Stephenson would not have lost his composure upon hearing such news unless he cared about that person a lot. </p></div>
