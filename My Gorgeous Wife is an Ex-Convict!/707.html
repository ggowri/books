        <h1>Chapter 706</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, her heart was dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, with a combination of medication and physical therapy, her knuckles were much better and had been pain-free for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, seeing Sean and Lily together now brought to mind images of her fingernails being pulled out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, her hand... Began to hurt again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a pair of big hands closed around her trembling, aching hands. An elegant baritone voice rang in her ears. "Your hands are cold."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... It's nothing. My hands just began to hurt a little suddenly. It should be all right in a minute," said Grace. She knew in her heart that the pain in her hand was more psychological than physical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing that, Jason frowned a little and took her hands more gently in his, lowering his head while breathing gently into them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already July, and it was a hot day. The trade fair's air-conditioners were on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's behavior might even seem bizarre.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Jason did not normally appear in front of the media, many of the people who attended the fair did not know him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was eye-catching enough, and what he was doing right now naturally caught the attention of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it was strange, people only found the scene to be beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A handsome man in a crisp suit was carefully holding a woman's hand. Those bright and charming peach blossom eyes were filled with worry. Anyone could see that this woman probably occupied a big position in the man's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was dressed in silver, looking elegant yet somewhat sweet. A flash of pain came over her comely face which immediately made the man look even more distressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Quite a few people were already secretly inquiring about who these two were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The onlooking women wished they were the ones being cared for by the man instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nearby, Sean and Lily also saw this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the woman whose hands were being warmed by Jason, Sean felt as if they were a world away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that an ex-girlfriend of his, who he had dumped like garbage, would become such a cherished woman by Jason, the ruler of Emerald City?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had even gotten more beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If when he first met her she seemed like a lovely girl next door, then now she had become an untouchable princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, the Stevens family was always nervous in front of the Reed family because they were afraid of being implicated by Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, fearing that they might offend Grace and thus Jason, they were even more fearful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was kind of ironic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing next to Sean, Lily watched the scene gloomily before turning her eyes to her fianc&eacute;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean seemed to have been giving her a bit of a cold shoulder since news of Grace's case reversal spread online, making her feel uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially now when Grace looked sweet and classy. Coupled with the serenity in her eyes, she was more attractive than before.</p></div>
