        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they saw Veronica, the two of them hurried over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer was busy saying, "Veronica, please save your dad. If you don't help him, he's really done for this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica frowned. Knowing her father, he must have caused some trouble again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's like this," explained stepmother Rosalind, "Your father borrowed a lot of money from some friends, hoping to invest it. But the investment failed, and the money still needs to be repaid. Some of those people are even involved in shady business, and if we can't pay them back, they might resort to violence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have any money," replied Veronica calmly. She had recently experienced a life and death situation, but her father and stepmother were completely unaware of it, and didn't even notice when she was hospitalized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Auntie Grace had asked her before if she wanted to contact her parents and tell them about her hospitalization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't want to. To her, they were no longer her family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, they only came to her when they needed something, and otherwise never bothered with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you not have any money? You have a good relationship with the Reed family. Even if you and Mason broke up, if you asked the Reed family for money, they would give it to you," said Archer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica sneered, "Borrow money? Then do you have the money to pay back the Reed family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as Dad earns money in the future, we will definitely pay back the Reed family," Archer quickly replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica laughed even more sarcastically, "So if you don't have money, you won't pay them back, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you say that, you child!" Archer became angry and embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you owe someone money, you can just sell your assets, like the house you're living in now, or Auntie Rosalind's jewelry. They should be worth a lot of money," Veronica suggested, glancing at the emerald jade bracelet her stepmother was wearing today. </span><span>She remembered her stepmother boasting to her about how she had bought it for nearly a million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These things are not easy to sell!" Rosalind hurriedly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you lower the price, someone will buy them," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, we can't sell them cheaply!" Rosalind and Archer said in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you can just borrow someone else's money? No, I should say you want someone else's money, because you have no intention of paying it back," Veronica spoke frankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, if you don't help your family borrow money from the Reed family, don't think you can just walk away. You're my daughter, do you think those people will let you go? They will only come to you for debt collection, and those people on the street will have their own methods. If you don't know, you can look it up online!" Archer said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica had long known that her father didn't really have any father-daughter relationship with her, but she didn't expect him to be so disgusting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I will look it up. So, can you leave now?" Veronica said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--" Archer was out of breath and was about to slap her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica spoke up, "You said it yourself, I have a good relationship with the Reed family. If you really hit me, believe it or not, you might be lying in the hospital tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer's face changed for a moment, and finally he angrily withdrew his hand, staring at Veronica. "I've said what I needed to say. Since you don't take my words seriously, don't regret it in the future!"</span></p></div>
