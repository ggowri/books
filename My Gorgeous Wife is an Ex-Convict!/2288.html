        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke nonchalantly, and Kyla did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss frowned slightly and said, "Mom, I have nothing to worry about if you take care of me, but... I want Kyla to come to the hospital to see me more often. I'm glad she's here now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss glared at her son and said, "Why don't I go to the doctor and ask about your condition? You two can talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss left the ward, and Kyla felt as if the pressure in the ward had been reduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Don't mind what my mother said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled. "Your mother cares about you. Why would I mind?" It seemed to her that his mother was cordial to her. At least, she did not embarrass her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla placed the food on Martin Weiss's bedside table. "Try the osmanthus rice porridge first. I made it with rice. You can think of it as a gooey drink. It&rsquo;ll make you feel full too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Martin Weiss smiled as he took the osmanthus rice porridge Kyla handed over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could taste a hint of sweetness when it entered his mouth, and all he could smell at the tip of his nose was the fragrance of osmanthus flowers. It smelled good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's delicious," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll make more tomorrow if you like it," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Won't it be too tiring? It must have taken a lot of work," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. Though it takes a little longer, it doesn't need constant observation. I just need to time it right. This is all I can do for you right now," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gazed at her intently. "But this makes me happy... Very happy..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla met his eyes in a daze, and a bitter feeling filled her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to be such a proud man, but now... he looked so humble in front of her. She had just made some food and visited him in the hospital, yet he... was so happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, what you asked me to think about... earlier, I..." She opened her mouth hesitantly, wondering whether to say yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;I should at least do what Lina said and git a try. I don't want to regret it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it seemed to take a great deal of courage to tell him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think we..." There was a quiver in her voice. Just as the words were about to spill, his fingers touched her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "If you haven't made up your mind and are still hesitating, you don't have to give me your answer first. You can tell me your answer after you think it through. Kyla, I want to be with you. I want you to be willing and not just do it on a whim because I saved you and the baby. I don&rsquo;t want you to do it out of gratefulness..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He laughed at himself at that. "Just think of it as... my last bit of pride."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though he would like her to stay with him, even if it was only out of pity, he could not resist stopping her from speaking when he saw her hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he loved her too much? Therefore... he wanted her to be willing all the more.</p></div>
