        <h1>Chapter 2441</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Martin Weiss seemed to come back to his senses and ran out. However, he only saw Kyla hailing a taxi to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Doesn't she know how dangerous it is to act alone in her condition?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla got out of the car with her big belly, and Martin Weiss's car quickly arrived soon after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss immediately lunged forward to pull Kyla as soon as he got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go. The Mitchell family is already inside! I need to go over!" Kyla said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if you go? Is it really only for the sake of getting one more minute?&rdquo; Martin Weiss asked. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I can get more time. I called the media when I was in the taxi. I want to make a big deal out of this, but..." Kyla paused. "I'll take responsibility for everything. You don't need to go in, lest the press target you. If Amber Mitchell's diagnosis confirms that she&rsquo;s mentally ill, then I&rsquo;ll say that I tricked Grace and the rest. I tricked Grace and her family into doing me this favor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's words shocked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not expect that Kyla, whom he thought would be of no help in this situation, would make such a decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What had gone through her mind when she made the call to ask the media to come over? What was it like for her to make such a desperate decision in the car?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the final diagnosis said that Amber Mitchell was indeed mentally ill, Kyla intended to take all the blame. She would become a joke for believing in mental patients and dragging down her innocent friends who trusted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would shoulder all responsibility. In this way, she would be the real culprit and would be blamed, while everyone else would be relatively unharmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's thin lips were almost pressed into a straight line before he said, "Don't forget that we're husband and wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll say that you weren&rsquo;t aware of anything, and I did everything of my own accord. You only came to Deer City to visit my friends with me. You didn't know I would do all this!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had mixed feelings. 'What is... this woman doing? Is she protecting me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since when did he need a woman to protect him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he accompanied her to Deer City, he had already prepared to get himself involved. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on," Martin Weiss said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Kyla was dumbfounded for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you going there to buy some time? Then go in. It'll be pointless if you're late. I'll go in with you, but I have one condition. You must hold my hand and not leave my side," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze as she was in disbelief at what she heard. "But if you go in with me, that means you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I can say I have nothing to do with it now? Instead of thinking about what will happen to me, you should pray that Amber Mitchell isn't really mentally ill!"</p></div>
