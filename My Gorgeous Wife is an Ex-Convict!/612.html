        <h1>Chapter 611</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop it, stop it!" Evelyn tried to cover her face and her body with her hands. She hated herself for not having enough of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Subconsciously, she tried to cover herself with the bag on the chair beside her, but the bag was slapped to the ground and the camera she had put in it rolled out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director's wife suddenly snorted. "That's funny. I'm not the only one who wants to record this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could the director not know what Evelyn was up to at this point? Ignoring the messy state he was in right now, he raised his hand and began punching and kicking Evelyn. "You b*tch, how dare you plot against me? Who do you think you are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Poor Evelyn. She was slapped a few times earlier and was now being fiercely beaten. She begged for mercy, but it was all in vain. The embarrassing state she was in was being filmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, these videos were all posted on the internet. Although some of the unsightly scenes were blurred out, how could the others not know what was going on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How shameless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Evelyn even planned to record a video like that to threaten other people. That's such an unethical move even if she&rsquo;s selling herself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's like public transport. Fortunately, the crown prince got rid of her. Leaving someone like her around the crown prince is like tarnishing him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Overnight, Evelyn had become a lowlife who everyone detested. Many people even posted online to enumerate how shameless she could be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the great director who had an affair, he could forget about making a name for himself in the industry. He was probably going to be permanently blacklisted from the industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the director's wife, who was the woman at the scene of the affair yesterday, dialed a number and said to the other side of the phone, "Thanks for your information, Terrence. I'm greatly relieved. I think I can get a divorce now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're welcome. If you need any help, feel free to contact me," replied Terrence who was on the other side of the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time he finished the call, Terrence looked at the list of trending topics on his phone. Evelyn should not be able to turn things around this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I hope this result can satisfy Young Master Reed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Let's just say that Evelyn was a fool to bother Grace. She's Young Master Reed's treasure! How could Young Master Reed allow others to hurt Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's scandal was well-known to everyone in Emerald City, and Grace, of course, also saw it online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching the online video of Evelyn being beaten up miserably, Grace only found her so different from the way she looked when she was proudly strutting in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was fast to fall from heaven to hell if you relied on someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's popularity stemmed from the fact that she was Brian's girlfriend, and without Brian's support, Evelyn was reduced to this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What about her? Was she relying on Jason now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help thinking that even though she was trying to be independent and strong and did not want to rely on anyone, it was Jason who helped her out every time she was in trouble.</p></div>
