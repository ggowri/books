        <h1>Chapter 562</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wore a white shirt against beige trousers, making him look a little casual and relaxed. His black hair was a little disheveled. The cold moonlight fell on him and half-dimmed his delicate features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only now, she felt he was a little different from usual. He was looking at her, his black eyes without the indifferent gaze he normally gave. Instead, it was misty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he looked at her made Grace feel uncomfortable. It was as if he was looking at something through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Brian walked up to her step by step, Grace felt a rush of alcohol in her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you been drinking?" she asked subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, a little," he said with a chuckle, his eyes focusing on her more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips slightly. "It's getting late. I've got to go home. Goodbye." As she spoke, she lifted her feet, intending to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when she had taken a step that his hand suddenly seized her arm and pulled her into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she fell into a wide embrace. The pungent smell of alcohol was far worse than what she had smelled when she stood apart from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He certainly had drunk more than a little! Just how much did he drink?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me go!" shouted Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hands still clung to her. "Tell me, how can I find you? I've been looking for you for a long time, but I can't find you! I can't find..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered. Was... Brian mistaking her for someone else? She did not think he meant to say these words to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me go first, Mr. Hart. You're drunk," said Grace. He held her tightly with his arms, rendering her struggles useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was at such times that the difference in strength between a man and a woman was revealed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Drunk? If only I were drunk. Do you know how much I want to be drunk?" muttered Brian. There was broken hoarseness in his cold voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't care who you think I am, you'd better let me go, or..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Or what?" He lowered his head, his face close to hers. The tips of their noses were almost touching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His scent completely enveloped her, and the pungent smell of alcohol raised a sense of danger in Grace's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was the normal Brian, she might still be able to communicate with him. However, how could she communicate with a drunk person?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned. "Please behave yourself, Mr. Hart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words caused a slight change in his expression. "Behave myself? I've been... Behaving myself too much..." That was why he had given up without even trying. "Why... Why aren't you her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she was that girl, then he could fight tooth and nail for her. He could fight tooth and nail against Jason and even do a lot more for her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not her? Grace did not know who Brian was referring to, but the moment Brian put his hand against her face, her hair stood up. She was having goosebumps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A sense of danger pervaded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If only I hadn't let go of your hand. You carried me down the hill on your back today that year... You said you'll protect me... And asked me not to be afraid..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A cold, choking voice rang in the night wind. His eyes watered, and tears rolled down his cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was dumbfounded, not expecting Brian to cry in front of her like that. This man who always gave people a sense of alienation and was aloof and noble felt strangely familiar to Grace right now.</p></div>
