        <h1>Chapter 3819</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica woke up, she felt like her whole body was in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to open her mouth, but her lips were incredibly heavy, making it difficult to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her throat was even more parched, like a dried-up desert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Water..." Almost instinctively, she murmured this word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just had surgery a few hours ago, so you can't drink water yet. Just bear with it for 12 hours before you can drink water," a familiar voice sounded in Veronica's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then realized that someone was sitting by her bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person speaking was someone she was very familiar with - Auntie Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie Grace, you..." she started to speak, but then a wave of pain hit her head, waking her up from her drowsiness and making her eyes go from blurry to clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, many images flashed by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right, the explosion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason came to save her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last image in her mind was Mason being trapped under rocks, and she was desperately trying to move them so he could escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened after that? She couldn't remember anything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason...where is he? Is he okay?" Veronica struggled to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain in her body seemed to become insignificant, and she just wanted to know how he was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's in the next room, just had surgery too, but he hasn't woken up yet," Grace said softly, noticing Veronica's worry. "Don't worry, the surgery went smoothly, and he should wake up in a few hours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is his injury?" Veronica asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He broke a few bones, and a bone accidentally pierced his lung, but the surgery went well, so as long as he rests well after the surgery, there shouldn't be any problems," Grace said. "You know his physical condition has always been good, and the doctor said he should recover faster than the average person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica stared at Grace. "Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Mason really had something going on, do you think I, as his mother, could just sit here calmly?" Grace asked in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica finally felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie Grace...I'm sorry..." Veronica apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace picked up a cotton swab and moistened Veronica's dry lips with water, allowing her to relieve her thirst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't apologize. I should thank you. If it weren't for you desperately moving the stones that were pressing on Mason, I might not have seen my son again," Grace said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, the construction site had activated unmanned drones to follow Mason into the blasting site, and as a result, the scene of Veronica desperately trying to help Mason escape was also captured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he hadn't come to save me...he wouldn't have been injured..." Veronica murmured. "It's my fault that he got hurt..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't blame yourself," Grace said. "It's the kidnappers' fault, and going in to save you was Mason's own decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I go see Mason?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really wanted to see Mason, the man who saved her life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Auntie Grace said he was safe, she still wanted to see him with her own eyes to truly feel at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Veronica spoke, she tried to move her body to get up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was frightened and quickly held Veronica down. "Don't get up. You just had surgery a few hours ago. You need to lie still!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really want to see Mason, I'll arrange it," Grace said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting herself in Veronica's shoes, she naturally understood the urgency of wanting to see her son at this moment.</span></p></div>
