        <h1>Chapter 2779</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Forget it. Since she said she didn&rsquo;t do me any wrong, I'll just assume she didn&rsquo;t," said Barbara Schuman, pretending to be aggrieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yanqing, how can you do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. How can you let her go so easily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she'll only be smugger if you let her off so easily!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd began to complain on Barbara Schuman's behalf, which Valda Theller found funny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was pressed hard on the shoulder. She was being forced to kneel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller struggled to push them away, but there were so many of them that she could not fight them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a thump, Valda Theller was forced to kneel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland panicked at the sound of this. "What are you doing? Who gave you the right to force her to kneel?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller deserves it. Or you can kneel with her!" someone said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Camille Strickland saw a waiter pass by and shouted, "Get someone from the private room next door. These people are harming me and my friend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The waiter froze slightly. He was about to ask, but someone already said, "We're just messing around. Our former classmate just can't take a joke!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"F*ck you!" Camille Strickland cursed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, Camille, why are you mad? We're just asking Valda Theller to have a drink!" they said. Then, the person said to the waiter with a smile, "We're having fun at our class reunion. You can go now. What could happen in your restaurant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The waiter left suspiciously, and Camille Strickland's eyes were instantly filled with disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland's eyes turned red as she saw someone stuff the mouth of the bottle into Valda Theller's mouth, forcing her to drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop. Stop it! Do... Do you know who Valda's boyfriend is? It's Brian. Brian won't let you off easily if you treat her like this!" Camille Strickland said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no plans to tell them that Brian was Valda's boyfriend at first. After all, Valda did not seem to want to tell the public, but she could only use Brian to stop these people's absurd behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to Camille Strickland's disappointment, the crowd laughed instead of stopping. "Camille Strickland, you should at least make up a decent lie. How dare you say Valda Theller's boyfriend is Brian? How ridiculous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, my husband is Jason if her boyfriend is Brian!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of smiling, hesitation flickered in Barbara Schuman's eyes. She suddenly recalled the last time Valda Theller was forced to act as a stunt double and almost got into trouble. Someone from Hart Group had saved Valda Theller at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides that, the actors who participated in the strike were replaced afterward. If it&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s capable of doing that... Could it really be Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman was shocked at the thought of this but immediately denied it.</p></div>
