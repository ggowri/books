        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he had a hard time refusing his daughter...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, but only for one night." Jason finally sighed, picked up his daughter, and said, "We'll head back to Emerald City tomorrow morning. We can't stay here any longer than that. Mommy and I have a lot of work to do when we go back to Emerald City, do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Got it!" The little head nodded vigorously. Jasper Reed's two small hands wrapped around Jason's neck as she gave him several kisses on his face in gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason was pleased with his daughter's kisses as a smile appeared on the corners of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed curled his lips, not surprised by his father's double standards. When he kissed his father, his father looked disgusted and said it was as if he were kissing himself. He even told him that boys should not kiss too often.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, his father enjoyed his sister's kisses. Was it because she looked like his mother? He had seen his father kiss his mother many times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His father kissed a lot too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he kissed his mother, his father would look upset. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His father's standards were always changing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason found the best hotel in Deer City and chose a family suite. It was about 650 square meters and had several rooms. It was very spacious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two children played in the room. Grace deliberately avoided the children and said to Jason, "It seems that you don't want Jasper to meet William?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's expression changed a little but did not hide it from her. "That's true."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you know beforehand that Philip Barlow wasn't going to bring William over today?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I sort of guessed it, but Philip Barlow never told me out loud. If he did, I wouldn't have brought you to Deer City," said Jason as he glanced at the room where the two children were in. "But Jasper has to come here so she can give up. Otherwise, she&rsquo;ll always be thinking about Deer City and William, which is bad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why is it bad to think about them?" Grace asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's because the more you think about something, the more you yearn for it. Over time, it&rsquo;ll become an obsession&mdash;something you want but can't get. At the end of the day, William is still related to Lily by blood. Speaking of which, the Reed family is considered his enemies. William is still young and might not be able to do anything lethal, but what about in the future? Who knows what that kid will do when he grows up? It won't be a good thing if Jasper is always thinking about him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As Jasper&rsquo;s father, he was trying to chip away his daughter's attachment to William to keep her safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're thinking too far ahead. Jasper just regards William as a good friend. Children don't know anything else!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Jason's eyes glimmered. That might be the case for Jasper, but not... William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I brought the boy back to the Reed family hoping he could suffer less. I don't want the previous generation's feud to involve the next generation, but this injustice has hurt William once again." Grace also felt guilty as she thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The husband and wife chatted casually while the brother and sister in the other room were whispering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Jasper asked quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't worry. I've found out where the Barlow family is. As long as we..." Mick Reed whispered for a while. Then, he said, "It&rsquo;ll work. Do you remember how to use what I gave you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes." Jasper nodded her little head and patted her Minnie Mouse backpack. She had kept it inside.</p></div>
