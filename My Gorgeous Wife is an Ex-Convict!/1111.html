        <h1>Chapter 1110</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... it turned out their relationship was just a &lsquo;mistake&rsquo; to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman he loved most was begging him to let her go. Was there anything more ironic?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll let you go." He heard his voice saying. "We have nothing more to do with each other after this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neither a lover nor a sister, no relationship of any kind existed between them from now onward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how two horizon lines were only horizon lines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took Grace back to her rental house. She had not been back for a week, and nothing had changed except for some dust in some places.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "You... didn&rsquo;t have to kneel before Jason. I could&rsquo;ve thought of something else even if you didn&rsquo;t kneel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a wry smile. 'I&rsquo;ll just think of it as payback for him kneeling before me previously.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yesterday, Jason knelt in front of her, begging her to love him! Today, she knelt in front of Jason, begging him to let her go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, thank you, but&hellip;" She paused and looked at his hands with a complicated gaze. Fortunately, Jason did not break Brian's left hand after all. Otherwise, she would owe him more. "You don't have to do this for me. Really, I told you I have no&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He interjected and said, "No feelings for me, right? It may be the case today and tomorrow, but can you be sure that it'll be the same in one or two years, even ten or twenty years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Brian's voice continued saying, "Grace, I can wait. As long as you don't fall for anyone else, then I can wait forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if&hellip; this goes on forever?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled faintly. "Then both of us can stay single and unmarried forever. Maybe it's not such a bad idea either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, not knowing what to say for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He got up and said, "Alright, you haven't been back for a week. Let me clean up your house. Otherwise, it'll be too dusty when you sleep at night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I'll do it myself," she said immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "What's the matter? Do you think I can't clean with only one hand? Even with only one hand, I can do a lot of things." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he began to clean the house for her. Grace had no choice. She could not stop Brian, so she cleaned the house with him. Soon, the place was finally clean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She boiled a pot of water and let it cool for a while. When it was warm, she filled a glass and handed it to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking the water, he suddenly said, "It seems to me that this is the first time you've offered me water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you see, just because something hasn't happened before doesn't mean it won't happen," he said. He had always given people a sense of indifferent estrangement, but now, he had a rare gentleness when he faced her. "Just like you. Maybe one day, you'll fall in love with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he threw his head back to finish the glass of water in his hand. He said, "Do you want me to send someone to protect you? In case Jason takes you away again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks." Grace shook her head. "After what he said today, I don't think he'll come to me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at Grace for a moment before nodding slightly. "Alright, it's late. I gotta go. You can call me any time if something comes up."</p></div>
