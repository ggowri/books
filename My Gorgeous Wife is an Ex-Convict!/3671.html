        <h1>Chapter 3669</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll walk you back to your dorm," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish his sentence, she wrapped her arms around his waist and buried her face in his chest. "William, can I hold you like this for a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down at the person in his arms. How could he refuse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," he replied, lifting his hands to hold her shoulders and pulling her closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His warmth and breath eased her previously suppressed emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think feelings can change quickly? Can you like one person during the day and another at night?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, then it's not real feelings or love," William replied. "If you truly love someone, it becomes ingrained in your bones. You won't easily fall for someone else. Instead, your love will grow stronger over time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gentle voice, carried by the wind, entered her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart stirred, "Is this the kind of love you have for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, this is the kind of love I have for you," William answered with absolute certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you change in the future? Will you fall in love with someone else?" She had never thought about this question before, but tonight, watching Lawrence with another woman, she couldn't help but think about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the future, would William fall in love with someone else again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not someone who easily falls in love with others. For over a decade, I have only loved you, and my love for you is growing stronger. Do you think I could spend so much time falling in love with someone else?" William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up and met his deep gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the darkness of the night, he looked so handsome, and her heart fluttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about you? Will you change? Will you fall in love with someone else?" His voice echoed in the night wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip slightly, "I think I'm someone who easily likes others, but that kind of liking is just friendship or admiration. The person I truly love like a boyfriend, I think, can only be you! So, wanting to be in a relationship with you is not just a momentary impulse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's the accumulation of emotions over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William smiled, his already beautiful face becoming even more radiant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So in the future, it can only be me!" he said, "You can like many people, but the person you truly love like a man, can only be me. No matter what happens in the future, it will only be me, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His low voice sounded like a plea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked directly into his gentle and affectionate eyes and said without hesitation - "Okay!"</span></p></div>
