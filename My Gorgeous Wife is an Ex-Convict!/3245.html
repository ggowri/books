        <h1>Chapter 3243</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The front desk suddenly fell silent, with a look of surprise in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So that person is actually the wife of the chairman who is rumored to be extraordinary in the company!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The experience of that lady has been circulating in the company, and it can almost only be described as legendary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was once the girlfriend of the chairman, but was cruelly abandoned and even went to jail. She had a child out of wedlock, but despite all of this, she was able to continue her relationship with the chairman and even got him to marry her. She is now officially known as Mrs. Weiss and has even given birth to a second child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How many women can have such an experience!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She's like a fighter jet among women!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She originally thought that the chairman's wife would be a shrewd and possibly dominant woman, even glamorous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the person just now was introverted and quiet, with a hint of elegance and gentleness, completely different from what she had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So it turns out that the chairman's lover is actually this type of woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla took the elevator to the floor where Martin's office was located. The secretary recognized her and greeted her immediately, saying "Madam, President Weiss is currently in his office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, the secretary led the way in front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla followed the secretary to the door of the office. The secretary lightly knocked on the door twice, then pushed it open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla walked into the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin stood up to greet her, "Why did you suddenly want to come here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I came over after leaving the wedding photography place and seeing that there was still some time left. I wanted to come and see you," Kyla said. "We're shooting three scenes with three outfits in total. Besides the wedding dress, I want to wear casual clothes for the other two outfits. I want to take some warm and cozy everyday photos."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Martin had no objections. "Then let's take a family photo with your mother-in-law, Nelson, and Trista next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's do that next time," Kyla smiled slightly. "This time, let's take photos of just the two of us. We can take family photos next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he was no longer under hypnosis and had regained all his emotions, taking family photos together would surely be a completely different experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Martin agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you can continue working. I'll wait for you here until you finish work. You don't have to worry about me," Kyla said, walking over to the sofa and sitting down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, so what do you want to drink or eat later? Just tell the secretary," Martin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Kyla replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin went back to his desk to work, while Kyla opened her phone and started searching for various ways to "chase a man."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he doesn't want to be with her after she breaks the hypnosis, then she will have to chase him again and work hard to win him over!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she can look at the methods others have used online and see which ones are better and more suitable for her to use.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are all kinds of ways to chase a man online, some of which even left Kyla stunned and amazed at the creativity of some netizens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It can only be said that there are many talented people among netizens!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you looking at?" Martin's voice suddenly sounded in Kyla's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked up suddenly and saw that he had walked up to her without her noticing. She quickly instinctively turned off her phone screen and said nervously, "Nothing...I wasn't looking at anything."</p></div>
