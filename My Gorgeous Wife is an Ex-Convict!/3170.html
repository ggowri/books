        <h1>Chapter 3168</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, you're not right about this. I was just trying to compliment you for saving a child's life and changing your own destiny. Why do you seem to think I said something wrong? Do you know how much Brian cares for Grace? If you hadn't saved her child, how could Brian have possibly..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What will happen?" A cold voice suddenly sounded beside the two of them. Lexi shuddered and turned around abruptly, only to see that Brian had somehow walked up to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Valda's gaze also turned towards Brian, looking at his handsome face covered in frost, and his phoenix eyes were already filled with coldness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is angry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She immediately realized it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that Lexi's words just now made him angry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right now, it was a gathering of the Hart family relatives. Valda didn't want there to be any distance between Brian and his relatives because of her. So she quickly stood up and walked briskly to Brian's side. She softly said, "I didn't take her words to heart, don't worry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian held Valda's hand tightly and said to Lexi, "Get lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Brian uttered these words, everyone was stunned. Lexi, in particular, looked at Brian with disbelief and asked, "Brian, what did you just say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want you to leave, and never step foot in here again!" Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi's face turned red instantly, and Auntie Sandy hurried over, asking "What happened? Is everything okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I just had a chat with Brian's fianc&eacute;e, and then Brian told me to leave. I didn't do anything to his fianc&eacute;e, and I was actually complimenting her the whole time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi looked extremely wronged and appeared very aggrieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Auntie Sandy quickly comforted her daughter and then turned to Brian, asking, "Brian, what's going on? Did you misunderstand something, or did someone spread rumors to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Auntie Sandy said this, she looked towards Valda, indicating that she thought Valda was the one who was gossiping and said something that caused Brian to misunderstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No one talks nonsense to me, and I haven't misunderstood anything. Auntie Sandy, you better take your daughter and leave now, or I will have someone throw her out directly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's words can be said to have shown no mercy towards Auntie Sandy's family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Auntie Sandy immediately looked embarrassed and said, "Everyone...we're all relatives, it shouldn't be like this." She then looked at Valda and spoke with a hint of reproach, "Miss Theller, if this is all because of something you said, don't you think you should speak up? What did you say that made Brian so angry with our Lexi?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The dirty water splashed onto Valda all at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda pursed her lips, feeling displeased, but still wanted to smooth things over since the other party was Brian's Auntie Sandy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before she could speak, Brian spoke up first and said, "Auntie Sandy, Valda didn't say anything. I heard it all myself! You should ask your daughter first about what she and Valda said and what their intentions were before jumping to conclusions about who started this whole thing."</p></div>
