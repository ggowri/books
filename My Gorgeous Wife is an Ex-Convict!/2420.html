        <h1>Chapter 2418</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The pain might be overwhelming for you when that time comes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cold voice rang in Martin Weiss's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said indifferently, "Then I&rsquo;ll hypnotize myself again. I&rsquo;ll hypnotize myself to forget about those feelings every time I recover them.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said no more. After all, only people involved in the relationship knew what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the meal, Kyla was sleepy again, so she returned to her hotel room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been getting sleepier and sleepier lately, especially after having lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she was drowsy in her sleep, she felt something pressing against her forehead. She tried desperately to get rid of it, but she seemed unable to no matter how hard she tried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Kyla suddenly opened her eyes, and Martin Weiss's face came into view. He was pressing his hand against her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He also had a tissue in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla finally realized that Martin Weiss was wiping her sweat for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," she said upon discovering that her forehead, chest, and back were covered with sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Did you have another nightmare?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No." She was embarrassed to say that her nightmare was his hand on her forehead. "I'm all sweaty. I want to change my clothes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got up and went to the closet. She took out a fresh set of clothes and looked at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss turned around and had his back to her, but he did not leave the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said nothing and began to change her clothes. She was pregnant, so Martin Weiss would not leave but just have his back to her when she changed her clothes in case something happened to her. It would be bad if something happened when he was not around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's belly was growing larger and larger, while her movements were growing slower and slower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she changed her clothes and pants, she said to Martin Weiss, "I&rsquo;m done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss turned around and saw no socks on Kyla's feet, so he took a pair of clean socks, crouched down, and put them on for Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla put one hand on Martin Weiss's shoulder while lifting one foot. "I ordered a sock changer online that makes changing socks easier. I can put on my socks in the future on my own without bothering you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss lowered his head and said indifferently, "This isn't the only thing you&rsquo;re bothering me with."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry." She bit her lip slightly and said, "You can leave Deer City first. I have Grace with me here. Nothing will happen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want me to leave?" He looked up and looked her straight in the eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's words seemed to be stuck in her throat. She... did not want him to leave. She cherished every day she got to spend with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They would not be together anymore in a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to see more of him and hear more of his voice, even though his voice was now colder than ever.</p></div>
