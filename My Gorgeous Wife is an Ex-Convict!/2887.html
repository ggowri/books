        <h1>Chapter 2885</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was why he had said such things at the time to keep the woman from leaving!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe I've liked you since then." It probably started earlier than he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's eyes watered as tears were about to pour out. She raised her hands and covered her eyes, "Brian, stop telling me such things!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such things would only make her waver when her resolution was hard-won. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he know how much determination and perseverance it took her to ask for a break-up and keep her distance from him to stop loving him when she loved him so much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though her hands shielded her eyes, they could not stop the tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers pulled her hands away. "Alright, I'll stop. I'll stop talking. Don't cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears had always left him flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hugged her and coaxed her. The indifference in his phoenix eyes had become affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finally stopped crying, but she still sniffled occasionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Holding a tissue, Brian carefully wiped the tears from her face. After a moment, he said, "If we have a baby and you don't want to marry me, then... we don't have to get married. You can have custody of the child, and the child can live with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze and looked at him in surprise. 'Is this his compromise?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I know there are many things I shouldn't force you to do, but I don't know what I can do that&rsquo;ll satisfy both of us. I'm sorry. It's my fault," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the lonely look on his face, she felt as though her heart was being twisted by something. The pain made it hard to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart ached because she loved him, but this heartache had such bad timing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's compromise made Valda Theller feel better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether she was pregnant was not up to her to decide. She could only go with the flow and decide what to do next if she was confirmed to be pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she was not pregnant, she could be done with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when the thought crossed her mind, she felt an emptiness in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and Brian spent the next few days together in the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had a desk set aside in his study so she would not feel uncomfortable using his desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller did not feel comfortable using the new desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was sharing the same study as Brian. Even when drawing, she could feel his eyes glancing at her from time to time, making her feel awkward. She even made several mistakes because of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, they had separate bedrooms. At least Valda Theller had some personal space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had been counting the days. She feared being pregnant, so she thought it would be nice if the results came later than sooner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In short, she found every day to be terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller sent a work email to Camille Strickland and chatted with her on her laptop in the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland: [By the way, your uncle's family came to see me today and asked me where you&rsquo;re staying now. They seem to want to see you.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller: [What did you tell them?]</p></div>
