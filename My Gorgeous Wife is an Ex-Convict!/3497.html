        <h1>Chapter 3495</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fair fingers retrieved her clothes from the drawer and placed them in her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was a bit stunned, then quickly put the clothes into the bag. "Okay, that's enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there nothing to put back?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I don't have any more," she said, her face turning slightly red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then bent down, closed the drawer, and opened his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her slightly blushing face and asked, "Are you blushing because I helped you carry those clothes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" She was taken aback, only seeing him gradually leaning down, his handsome face facing her. "But Veronica, I always thought that we should be the closest people. When we were young, you always protected me, helped me bathe, helped me dress, and hugged me to sleep. I could be completely honest with you about everything, but Veronica, you can't, can you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Mason in front of her, the word "yes" seemed to get stuck in her throat, making it difficult to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, am I the closest person to you?" he asked softly, his deep black eyes filled with hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes." Finally, this word "yes" came out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His lips curled up into a smile that bloomed on his face. "So, I will always be Veronica's closest person, okay? We will always be together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pursed her lips. In her heart, he was more than a relative by blood, he was a loved one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But forever...how far is forever?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They are slowly growing up and in the future, they will have their own loved ones and families. It's impossible for them to always be together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the face of his smile, these words became unspeakable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe he didn't want the smile on his face to disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After organizing their clothes, Veronica and Mason planned to leave, but Archer and Rosalind happened to come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he saw Veronica, he hurriedly approached her and said, "Veronica, your brother has been detained. You need to think of a way to rescue him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, the police station called and said he's a suspect. They claim that all the kidnappers identified him as the mastermind. If he's really convicted, what will he do in the future?" Rosalind said with a worried expression on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yesterday, the couple spent the whole night at the police station trying to bail out their son, but they couldn't even see him in person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kidnapping... especially when one of the victims is Jasper from the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon realizing this fact, they felt a strong urge to faint. Even though their son can be a bit stubborn and reckless at times, they never expected him to be so audacious and daring!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at her father and stepmother in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since she woke up in the hospital yesterday until she was discharged today, she never saw them in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who care about her are the Reed family, who are actually her relatives! But when they met, they didn't ask how she was injured. Instead, they immediately demanded that she hand over her brother.</p></div>
