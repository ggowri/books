        <h1>Chapter 389</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is there something else... behind Grace's accident?' Brian thought and laughed a little. The one who died in the accident was Jason's fianc&eacute;e, Jennifer Atkinson. Grace was now with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if there was really something else behind that car accident, Jason would have checked it out. Why did he bother to worry?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... "When did Grace start working in your restaurant?" Brian asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Kyla Corbyn was stunned. After a while, she replied, "About half a month ago. She came to apply as a delivery rider."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How does she usually behave at your restaurant?" Brian continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's pretty good. She works hard, is efficient in delivering the orders, and doesn&rsquo;t complain&hellip;" Kyla Corbyn described how Grace behaved in the restaurant while Brian listened with fascination as he held one cheek in his hand. He was smiling faintly, and his originally indifferent face had a touch of faint gentleness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn could not help but feel surprised. Did Brian have feelings for Grace... How was that possible?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was the famous prince of the entertainment industry. He was surrounded by all kinds of beautiful women. She noticed that Grace only wore ordinary clothes and was barefaced whenever at work. She even had calluses on her hands, which meant she did a lot of rough work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that people like Brian would have anything to do with Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla Corbyn finished telling Brian about Grace, he once again turned his focus on her. "You said she told you she'd been to prison when she came to your restaurant to apply for a job. Why did you hire her anyway? Aren't you afraid that something might happen and your restaurant might get into trouble?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gave a wry smile. "Maybe it's because I've been to prison too, so I felt compassion." Putting herself in her shoes, she could tell that Grace really wanted a job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Compassion..." Brian muttered thoughtfully. After a while, he said to Kyla Corbyn, "All right, I'll help you. I won't tell Martin Weiss that I've seen you, but I can't guarantee that no one else will tell him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even this guarantee was enough for Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Mr. Hart. Thank you..." Kyla Corbyn thanked him again and again. She seemed to understand vaguely that maybe it was her &lsquo;compassion&rsquo; that made the entertainment industry's prince agree to her request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The prince might really like Grace... However&hellip; Kyla Corbyn had a look of worry in her eyes. Was this good or bad for Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had been a cautionary example. Having spent time with Grace these days, she saw her more as a friend than an employee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's fate might change if she was involved with the prince, but it was hard to predict her future happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins got a call from his landlord around noon, saying that someone had entered the room he rented yesterday. He was immediately alarmed and hurriedly asked, "Who was it? I've rented the room. How can you open the door without my permission?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The landlord was angered by his question. "You've got a lot of nerve to say so. I rented the room for you to live in, yet you put a cinerary casket in it! Besides that, if it weren't for you, the police station wouldn't have come to inspect my house and ordered me to reform it. I'm calling to tell you that I need to reform my house and I'm not refunding the rest of your rent and deposit!"</p></div>
