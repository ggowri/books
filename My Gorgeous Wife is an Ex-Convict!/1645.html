        <h1>Chapter 1643</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The way she looked made Grace want to laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, it's great that you two are close," said Grace as she raised her hand to straighten her daughter's clothes. Then, she said, "It's not right to fight, but Jasper did it because she cares about Aunt and me. Both of you need to understand that fighting isn't the way to solve problems. Most of the time, it'll intensify the problem and turn small problems into big ones."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Insight flashed through Mick Reed's eyes as he listened. The boy knew that fighting was a bad idea. After all, the Reed family had never educated their heirs to be thugs. The little one was more precocious and intelligent than other children of his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jasper seemed to only understand half of it. There was a look of disapproval on her face. It was obvious she still thought it was more convenient to fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help but sigh to herself when she saw her children's different reactions. Although her daughter was also smart, it was obvious she was not using her brains at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You'll understand it in time." Grace patted her daughter's little head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, there were some things one had to experience to understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did not expect Irene Lynch to come to Reed Residence with Oriel Lynch in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch was wearing a small hat when she came. However, Irene Lynch took Oriel Lynch's hat off once they entered the living room. Suddenly, the bald patch on Oriel Lynch's head looked utterly conspicuous. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Reed, I brought Oriel here to apologize to Jasper," Irene Lynch said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Apologize?" Jason frowned slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch said sheepishly, "Didn't Mrs. Reed tell you? Today in kindergarten, Jasper hit Oriel and pulled her hair out because Oriel misspoke. It was wrong of Jasper to hit her, but it was all because Oriel said something she shouldn't have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch then spoke to her daughter, "Oriel, hurry and apologize to Jasper!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh!" replied Oriel Lynch as she walked up to Jasper with red eyes. "Jasper, I'm sorry I called your aunt and mom a homewrecker. I... I secretly played with Mommy's phone the other day and saw a video about it. They also said that your mother is having an illicit relationship with her mentor. Well... what kind of a relationship is an illicit relationship? Do you know what it means?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The child's voice rang out in the living room, and Grace's heart sank. She instantly knew what Irene Lynch was up to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It might look like an apology, but she was using the child to make Jay suspicious and drive a wedge between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper was a child, after all. She did not realize what was going on. She thought Oriel Lynch was really here to apologize. "I don't know either, but you mustn't speak ill of my mommy and aunt again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I got it. I'll watch my mouth. Who's your mother's mentor? Is he close to her?" Oriel Lynch continued to follow the script her mother had given her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she did not want to apologize, her mother said she would one day become Mr. Reed's real daughter if she did this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper and her mother would also be kicked out of the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, she memorized the script and recited it word for word even though she did not want to apologize.</p></div>
