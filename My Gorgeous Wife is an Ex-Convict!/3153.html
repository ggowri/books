        <h1>Chapter 3151</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When it comes to the company's issues, no one knows better than the old Mr. Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If things had stopped there, he could have pulled some strings and the Barlow family would have been able to get through it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But with the daughter causing such a scene, there is no turning back now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, he doesn't even have the strength to scold his daughter anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy looked resentful and said, "Why does that cripple have so many people protecting him? Brian must be blind to fall for a woman like Valda! They are so arrogant now, but I will make sure Valda suffers more than me in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Barlow, who is elderly, couldn't take it anymore and slapped his daughter directly across the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy couldn't believe it and covered her cheeks, "Dad, did you hit me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I hit you. I hit you because I didn't hit you enough. That's why so many things happened. If it weren't for what you did at the film festival, our family wouldn't have been investigated. You would have been banned by the Hart family! And what happened? I asked you to apologize to calm things down, but you made things worse! Let me tell you, if you mess with Valda again, we will sever our father-daughter relationship. I don't want to risk my life because of you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Old Mrs. Barlow quickly comforted her husband by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy covered her cheeks and lowered her head, finally unable to say anything more! However, in her heart, she hated Valda even more. If it weren't for Valda, how could she have been beaten by her father, and even her father said such cruel words to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's all Valda's fault!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The live stream had a better outcome than expected. After many people learned that Valda was injured and missing while trying to save the Reed family's little daughter, they spontaneously began to defend and support Valda online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people admire Valda's social circle, as she has connections with many influential people and even their spouses, as seen from her impressive friend list on social media.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Valda herself didn't expect that Grace and Kyla would join her live stream, and she wasn't even that close with Lina. However, Lina stood by her side, along with her husband Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that the other person was trying to build up her image.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the live broadcast ended, she received a call from Grace and her friends. So, she decided to start a video conference mode and gratefully said to everyone, "Thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thanking me for? If anyone should be thanking anyone, it's me thanking you!" Grace said. "Valda, Jason and I owe you so much. If anyone else tries to attack you online, I won't let them get away with it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Valda, we're all friends here. No need to say thank you!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, this matter should be over soon. When are you free next? Let's all get together!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Amber chimed in, saying "Count me in for the gathering, I really want to hang out with you guys!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, Amber also came to the live broadcast room and watched Valda's live stream. From her perspective, Valda could have hidden behind Brian, but instead she chose to face the situation.</p></div>
