        <h1>Chapter 2749</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I gotta go. I'll bring Valda to see you next time," Brian said as he got up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Brian was about to reach the ward door, Grace suddenly said, "Brian, when you came to the hospital yesterday, Valda... didn't misunderstand anything, did she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian chuckled. "She knows I used to like you, but she also knows she's the one I like now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good." Grace was relieved. "Valda is a good woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I know," Brian said and walked out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the ward door, which opened and closed again. She was somewhat entranced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Jason's voice rang as he handed another piece of apple to her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. I just hope Brian can be happy," murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Everything will turn out as you wish. Believe me," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chuckled and looked at her husband. "Are you sure?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His deep peach blossom eyes were bright. "Yes, I'm sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if it did not, he would try to make it turn out the way she wanted! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked out of the hospital, took out his phone, and called Valda Theller. "Where are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm in my studio," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you busy with work?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will I be disturbing you if I come over?" he asked, suddenly wanting to see her and hear her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just come over. But I'll be busy with my assistant and you might get a little bored," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter," Brian replied and drove to Valda Theller's studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and her two assistants were in the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two assistants had seen Brian before. They were now looking curiously at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller made Brian a cup of tea and said, "Sit wherever you like. I still have something to work on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, go on," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller returned to her work desk and continued drawing with her two assistants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian sat on the couch and held the tea as his phoenix eyes looked at Valda Theller not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was as absorbed in her drawing as she had been when she was drawing him when he modeled for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her two assistants glanced at him now and then, but she did not. Her attention was always on her drawing, and anyone could see how serious she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled. Few people were as focused as Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must be this focused because she loved her career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can I fall in love with this woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can I fall in love again after loving Grace? Or... will I still not fall for her even if I don't hate her and even if I appreciate her sometimes?'</p></div>
