        <h1>Chapter 2336</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked you to give me a chance, a chance to stay with you. I would make you fall in love with me again, but you weren&rsquo;t even willing to give me that,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face paled slightly, but she still quietly waited for what he would do next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm offering you a chance today. If you can make me want to be with you, I'll spare Jacqueline Bowman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as soon as he said this, her expression changed instantly. She looked at him in shock. She could hardly believe what she was hearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... I'm pregnant," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s not impossible, is it? Aren't you already past the early stages of pregnancy? If you ask a doctor if it's okay to do it, the doctor will say yes too. Kyla, aren't you willing to do anything for your friends? What's the matter? I&rsquo;m giving you a chance, yet you're turning it down. Besides, I'm talking about whether you&rsquo;re willing or not. Do you think I, a man who doesn't love you, will be willing to do such a thing with you?" he said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's face reddened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that he was insulting her to vent his anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man in front of her no longer felt the same way for her as back then when he was willing to even risk his life to save her. He now no longer loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? Why don't you give it a try and see if I'll like it? If you're that capable, you can have everything want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was still ringing in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's hands that were by her sides clenched slightly. She knew that perhaps he wanted nothing more than to see her flaunt herself like a jester, and maybe she would get nothing but shame in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had to give it a try for Amber Mitchell. Even if there were dangers and difficulties in front of her, she would go through them. Besides... she had hurt him once, and it was only fair that he hurt her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla slowly stepped forward and leaned over slightly while she pressed her hands gently on Martin Weiss's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not move and only looked indifferently at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt the palms of her hands sweat a little as she became nervous. Her fingers gently pushed his collar aside while her fingertips touched the skin of his neck. Her face drew closer and closer to his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was getting closer and closer... It was close enough that she could count his eyelashes, see her face in his eyes, and feel his breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression was so indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to smile so gently at her when he was in the hospital. His dark eyes were full of love as he tenderly held her hand and said to her, "Kyla, I'll be good to you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, all that was left between them now was indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla let her lips press against his thin lips. His slightly cold lips made her timid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried her best to kiss him, but he did not respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gloom flashed across Kyla's eyes. She was about to back off when his big hand grabbed the back of her head suddenly. "Is that all? It's so simple that it's not even enticing to me. How could such a kiss turn me on or make me willing? It should at least be like this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After he finished speaking, his lips rested heavily on hers, and a fierce kiss followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla almost gasped for breath from the kiss. She almost lost herself in the intense kiss. What had happened between them in the hospital kept flashing across her mind.</p></div>
