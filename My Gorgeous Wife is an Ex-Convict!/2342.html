        <h1>Chapter 2340</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I want you to promise me not to appear in front of Martin and affect his life again unless it's related to the children!" said Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was about to speak when the private room door was suddenly pushed open. However, the person who entered was not a staff of the club but Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shouldn't you ask me before saying yes? After all, I'm involved, aren't I?" Martin Weiss entered the private room, pulled a chair, and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss was shocked to see her son appear. "What are you doing here, Martin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I hadn't come, would you have negotiated the terms without me?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said as his eyes rested on Kyla. "What's the deal you negotiated with my mother? Did my mother ask you to promise not to appear in front of me again before she'll help you get Jacqueline Bowman out on probation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he did not overhear the full conversation, he could still figure it out from the last sentence said when he entered. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened, pressed her lips together tightly, and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said coldly, "Then let me make it clear to you today that my mother can't help you with this. Jacqueline Bowman will be given a heavy sentence. You can try other ways to find out your friend's whereabouts."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla turned a little pale. Her hands that were on the table were clenched, while her shoulders shuddered gently as if she was under so much pressure that she was about to collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way she looked made him frown a little, but he brushed the discomfort in his heart away. "Instead of trying to make a deal with my mother, why don't you figure out how to get me to change my mind and agree to your request?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss said, "Martin! Do you want to get back together with this woman again? Have you forgotten how she dumped you before this? You've done enough for her. Even though you wronged her back then, you&rsquo;ve long made up for it!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, this is between her and me. Stay out of it," Martin Weiss turned to say to his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But how can I stay out of it?' Mrs. Weiss sighed to herself. She did not want to face the possibility of losing her son again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, I beg you to spare Jacqueline Bowman for now and end things with Kyla. Even if Jacqueline Bowman does get out on probation, there&rsquo;ll be plenty of ways to send her back to jail. I&rsquo;ll make that woman miserable! But... leave Kyla alone, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss pleaded, but Martin Weiss only leaned over gently and hugged his mother. "Mom, I told you this is between her and me. Stay out of it. Since she wants Jacqueline Bowman to get out on probation, I'm the one she should be asking!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Mrs. Weiss tried to say more, but Martin Weiss had straightened up. He pulled Kyla, who was sitting, and walked away.</p></div>
