        <h1>Chapter 2615</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a pair of deer-like round eyes, and her hair was in a ponytail. Her small nose and pink lips made her look amiable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was something familiar about the face, and Brian&rsquo;s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was raining that day and we talked while you were in the rain. Do you remember?" Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes gleamed a little as he remembered the woman who had held an umbrella over him when he was in the rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not expect to see her here again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't remember?" His silence could not help making Valda Theller slightly awkward. After all, they had only met once. It was natural if he did not remember.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I remember," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She breathed a sigh of relief. "I thought you forgot me. That would be embarrassing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked down gently. "It's the first time anyone thought I was going to kill myself. It's hard to forget."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her relaxed expression instantly changed to embarrassment. "I'm sorry. I just thought you seemed to be experiencing something sad and misunderstood you. Do you feel better?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll never feel better.' Brian ignored her but gracefully pulled a pair of disposable chopsticks out of the chopsticks holder on the table and broke them apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The donburi that Brian ordered was soon served, and he ate it slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could not help looking at the man in front of her. He wore a crisp suit and was sitting elegantly. He was only eating, but he gave others an air of elegance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People like him should not be eating donburi in a small restaurant like this. Instead, he should be eating French cuisine in a fancy and high-class restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However&hellip; for some reason, during the two times she met this man, she only found him indifferent. It was as if his world had been closed off to others, and he did not allow others to approach him. He had no interest in anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a deadly silence. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did such a man give off such a deadly silence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had already finished her meal, but she still looked blankly at Brian as she sat in her seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you done?" His cold voice rang suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, I'm sorry. I was rude." Valda Theller apologized hurriedly. 'Gosh. Am I doing it again? I keep staring whenever I see a good-looking person.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even her best friend, Mian Mian, used to nag her from time to time. "Hey, Valda. You should get rid of that bad habit. At least don't stare so blatantly. People who know you know that you look at beautiful and handsome people for inspiration. But strangers would think you're up to no good!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a cartoonist, especially a romance cartoonist, Valda Theller could not help looking at good-looking people and wondering what they would look like when drawn with a pen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had rarely stared at someone like this over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather, she had drawn many beautiful and handsome people over the years that it was relatively difficult to catch her eyes no matter how good-looking a person was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However&hellip; the man in front of her was different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was undeniably beautiful, giving her an impulse to draw him. However, compared to his looks, what attracted her more was the deadly silence from his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help wondering what had happened to the man that his body was filled with this cold deadly silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop wondering about it. It's none of your business!' Valda Theller told herself. What she ought to do now was bid goodbye and leave.</p></div>
