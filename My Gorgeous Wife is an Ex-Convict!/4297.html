        <h1>Chapter 4295 Still liking the same as before</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina almost walked out of Chandler's company in a daze. When the driver wanted to drive her back, she said, "I want to take a walk by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to catch her breath, otherwise, she felt like she was suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina walked along the road, while the driver slowly followed in the car behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tina reached a shopping mall, suddenly a voice rang out: "Tina?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina turned around and saw Eugenia not far away, waving and shouting at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia... that was her friend before she lost her memory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after losing her memory, she took a leave of absence from school, and her contact with </span><span>Eugenia decreased a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia approached and looked at Tina, saying, "Are you shopping alone? Are you feeling better?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've recovered almost completely." Tina said, "But it's not really alone, there's a driver following behind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia looked towards the car not far behind Tina and guessed that must be the car following her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why are you walking here alone?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just wanted to catch my breath," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let your driver wait at the parking lot of the mall, and we can go shopping together and chat. It's been a long time since we went shopping together!" Eugenia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright." Tina agreed and made a call to the driver in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the driver drove towards the parking lot of the mall, and Tina entered the mall with Eugenia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia first took Tina to the entrance of a beverage shop: "By the way, can you drink now? You used to really like this shop's drinks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? I liked this shop's drinks?" But she didn't have any memory of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, especially the peach flavor," Eugenia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's order a cup," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Eugenia and Tina each held a cup of drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina took a sip, the rich milky taste with a hint of sweet peach flavor, it was indeed delicious. No wonder the old her liked to drink it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it, the taste is good, right? Do you like it?" Eugenia asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I quite like it," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia smiled: "Just as I thought. I always felt that since it's something you used to like, even if you lost your memory, as long as you experience it again, you will like it again. After all, you're still the same person, your preferences and tastes should still be the same!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina froze and stared blankly at the drink in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she lost her memory, would her preferences and tastes still be the same? </span><span>So</span><span> if it was someone she used to love, even if she lost her memory, would she love them again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, you seem quite down today. What happened?" Eugenia asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pursed her lips and didn't directly answer her friend's question. Instead, she said, "Eugenia, did I really love Chandler?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Of course</span><span> you did, you asked that a long time ago." Eugenia hesitated and asked, "By the way, there are rumors online saying that you and Chandler got divorced, is it true or not?"</span></p></div>
