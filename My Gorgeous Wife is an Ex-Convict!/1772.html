        <h1>Chapter 1770</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was kissing her, but what Brian said today filled his mind again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had never felt it was wrong to do whatever it took to reach his goal. It was what Old master Reed had taught him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not the process that mattered but the result, and the result was what he had expected at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he was now afraid that she would learn how despicable he was. She already knew that he had coldly looked on as she was sent to jail back then, and it had once made her so resistant toward him. If she found out about the rest of the things, would she think he was too despicable?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;Despicable&rsquo; had never been a derogatory word to him, but now, it became one of his fears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace..." When the kiss was over, he murmured her name. "I do everything I do because I love you so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Why did you say that all of a sudden?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing." His lashes quivered a little as he looked down. Then, he looked at her hands that were wrapped in gauze. "Do you regret it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She paused and heard his voice say... "Do you regret saving Brian? Your hands wouldn't have gotten so bad. It would&rsquo;ve been much better if you hadn't held Brian so desperately today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was the one who regretted it instead when he spoke. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What answer am I expecting? Yes or no?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I know exactly what answer she&rsquo;s going to give me, don't I?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No." Grace's voice reached Jason's ears, causing him to freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Sure enough, it's the same answer. So she&rsquo;s willing to trade her hands for Brian's life?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay." She raised her hands with some difficulty as her bandaged fingers were entwined with the wires. Even the simple act of holding his face was so difficult for her now. "I don't regret it because I don't want to feel guilty in the future. I was sure that you&rsquo;d come up the hill to find me and save me. I was sure that if I held on a little longer, I would survive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyelashes quivered. "Do you believe in me that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's because I know you love me. I know you love me enough to risk everything to find me!" she said. She knew how much he loved her when he left his will at the cliff and risked his own life to save her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What about Brian? What if he loves you enough to risk everything too?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace hesitated a little, remembering how he had shouted at her several times to let go and leave with Mason when she was holding onto his wrist to stop him from falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she had really let go of him, Brian would have fallen and been buried alive by the collapsed hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could never reciprocate Brian's feelings in this life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Jay, my heart is too small to hold so many people. I don't regret using these hands to grab onto Brian today because he saved Mason and me. I would have done the same for any other person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Speaking of which, I'm the one who should regret what has happened to your hands. If I had..."</p></div>
