        <h1>Chapter 4209</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is she doing?" Chandler asked, walking to the bedside with a trembling hand, but hesitating to touch Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed as if he was afraid that a gentle touch would shatter her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dean quickly asked Tina's current attending physician to explain her current condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, Chandler asked, "Can she be transferred to another hospital with her current physical condition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It would be best to wait another day until her condition stabilizes before transferring her," the doctor said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then we'll wait here for a day," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the dean asked again, "Mr. Hunter, will Miss Stephenson's child be transferred together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the dean couldn't really guess whether the child in Tina's belly was Chandler's, so when he asked this question, he was extra cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, they will be transferred together," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the child that Tina fought so hard to give birth to!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, he felt no joy at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor had already expla</span><span>ined earlier that Tina's condition was not good and had a lot to do with the premature delivery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the pregnancy, her condition wouldn't be so bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright." The dean looked at Chandler's gloomy expression and didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to be alone with Tina for a while. You all can leave first. If there are any changes in her condition, I will immediately call for the doctor," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, everyone began to prepare to leave the ward. Suddenly, Chandler asked again, "By the way, where is Kit? The man who was brought to the hospital with Tina!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, a tense atmosphere filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dean's expression stiffened as he glanced at the person behind him. After a while, a nurse finally timidly stepped forward and revealed the room number where Kit was staying.</span></p></div>
