        <h1>Chapter 2515</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's troublesome. If we can't get Louise Mitchell this time, I'm afraid it&rsquo;ll be difficult to convict her in the future," said Jason. The Gregory family was no pushover and had great influence in Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell is now collecting additional evidence, and the Moss family has agreed to help her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"the Moss family is willing to help her?" Jason was surprised. After all, Daley Moss hated Amber Mitchell to the core.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's because the car accident that led to Herman Moss's death was probably planned by Louise Mitchell! Besides, Louise Mitchell is the biggest beneficiary of the accident," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows. "It seems that the Gregory family doesn&rsquo;t know Louise Mitchell is the mastermind of the accident. If they knew, George Gregory wouldn't have married Louise Mitchell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They probably don't know yet, but Amber Mitchell is keeping the news to herself for now. She's afraid of acting rashly and alerting the enemy, which will be bad if evidence stacks up against her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sighed. "If the truth comes out, George Gregory will be in for a shock."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He brought it upon himself. He keeps saying he loves Amber Mitchell, but he never once trusted her. When Amber Mitchell was sent to the mental hospital, he married Louise Mitchell without a word. Perhaps he only cared about money. He would marry anyone who had shares in Mitchell Group and was helpful to his career."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no sympathy for George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked down. In his opinion, it was not that George Gregory did not love Amber Mitchell. It was just that his love was clouded by jealousy. When Kyla played the video of Amber Mitchell in the hospital in front of the reporters, the shock and pain in George Gregory's eyes did not fool anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the truth was out and George Gregory understood that Amber Mitchell had never done him wrong, it would be when George Gregory fell into the abyss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">the Moss family was efficient. Soon, they found the whereabouts of Stan Lucas, Sandra Lucas's younger brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stan Lucas was in Deer City. He owned several houses and a bakery. He also had a wife and children. One could say that he was living a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as soon as Amber Mitchell looked into the timeline of when Stan Lucas gained his fortune, she found that two of the houses he owned and his current store were purchased in the early years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Given the Huang family's financial resources at the time, there was no way they had so much money to buy two houses and one store. The total amount added up to over five million dollars, which matched the six million dollars unaccounted for in Louise Mitchell's account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell came to the hospital. According to the information the Moss family had given her, Stan Lucas needed to be treated in the hospital for about a week because of sudden deafness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to talk to Stan Lucas first to sound him out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she came to the inpatient department, she heard a nurse hurrying past her while saying, "Is it true that there&rsquo;s not enough type-B blood in the hospital&rsquo;s blood bank? What about the child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who knows? Two accident patients were brought in for major surgery. Both happen to have type-B blood, so the hospital gave them the blood first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The quickest blood transfer from the blood bank will take more than an hour."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Dr. Zhang has already told the doctors and nurses in the hospital to see who has type-B blood so they can donate it to the child first. The child needs a transfusion. He&rsquo;ll need a lot of blood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell suddenly ran up to the two nurses who were about to get on the elevator and said, "Is there a child who needs type-B blood as soon as possible? I'm type-B, and I'm willing to donate my blood."</p></div>
