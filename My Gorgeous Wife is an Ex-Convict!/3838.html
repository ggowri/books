        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much longer will Lawrence continue to hurt Jasper?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Lawrence's revenge doesn't stop here, William will have to find a way to prevent him from doing anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he does decide to take action against Lawrence, he must keep it a secret from Jasper and not let her find out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, given how much she values Lawrence, she may not forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, William felt the suffocating feeling in his chest becoming stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car arrived at the school and William and Jasper got out together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper checked the time and estimated that Lawrence should still be in the school laboratory, so he said to William, "Let's go to the laboratory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," William replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they arrived at the laboratory door, they saw Lawrence coming out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them looked at each other, each with their own thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Lawrence's voice broke the silence, "Are you two here to see me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I have something to ask you," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ask me something?" Lawrence raised an eyebrow. "What about Mr. Barlow? Does he also want to ask me something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, he's just accompanying me," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, shall we go inside the laboratory to talk? There's no one inside now, and I don't want unrelated people to hear our conversation," Lawrence said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Jasper agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute!" William interrupted. "Let's go somewhere else. There's no need to talk in the laboratory. We can find a place in the school where there's no one around. I'll stand far away and just watch, I won't be able to hear what you're saying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence chuckled, "What's the matter, Mr. Barlow? Are you afraid I'll do something bad to Jasper in the laboratory? Also, I'm not interested in being watched by others while I'm talking to someone. If you don't want to go to the laboratory, then we don't have to talk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lawrence spoke, he gestured to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stopped Lawrence and said, "I can go into the lab!" Then she turned to William and said, "Wait for me outside for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." William's face was filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, what could happen here?" Jasper said, following Lawrence towards the lab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before entering the lab, they needed to put on lab coats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence handed Jasper a lab coat and said, "Put this on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper took the lab coat and put it on. She watched as Lawrence walked up to the glass door of the lab and unlocked it with his fingerprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them entered the lab and the glass sliding door closed automatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Jasper's first time in the school's chemistry lab. It was similar to the lab Lawrence had taken her to outside of school, with all the bottles and containers that </span><span>she couldn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, she knew that many of these things were dangerous, so she tried to stay away from them and definitely didn't touch them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what do you want to talk to me about? Or do you have any questions for me?" Lawrence stopped walking and turned to Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at Lawrence's handsome face and remembered what he looked like when he was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought of what she wanted to ask him on the way there, but now that she was face to face with him, she hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he really was the manipulator that Daniel had mentioned, what should she do?</span></p></div>
