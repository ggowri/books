        <h1>Chapter 4004</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene didn't dare to say anything to Grace anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her real goal today wasn't Grace anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then Mr. Reed should kowtow. Is that not okay? If this doesn't work, I'll take you down with me!" Irene threatened again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to torture someone, torture me instead. Why do you have to treat my brother like this? You... don't you like my brother? Is this how you treat someone you like?" Jasper shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I like him, but look at how he treated me! I just want him to kowtow to me and apologize properly. What's wrong with that?" Irene retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll kneel down and kowtow to you, and I'll apologize to you too!" Mick said coldly. "The Reed family can meet all the conditions you've set, but you can't hurt these two women!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, I won't hurt your most important people," Irene smirked, feeling victorious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick lowered his head and knocked his forehead on the rough ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stared at the man kneeling and kowtowing not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the pride of Emerald City, standing on a high point since birth, and many people had to kneel before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he knelt down! And kowtowed to Irene, a small person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such a man should not be humiliated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for her and Jasper being controlled by Irene...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Nancy knew that Mick's kneeling at the moment was just to save Jasper, and had nothing to do with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But because he said, "Don't hurt them again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He included her too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though her inclusion was just incidental, she was grateful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sadly, at the moment, she could only watch and do nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With each kowtow, blood oozed from Mick's forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene seemed satisfied and said, "Okay, only ten minutes left!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ten minutes? What ten minutes?" William asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Only ten minutes left until the bomb explodes!" Irene said. "Now these two people are both on the cliff. In ten minutes, the bomb in front of us will explode. By then, I and these two people will naturally be killed, with no one spared..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she looked at the reactions of the people in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people's faces were tense, incredulous, worried, and bewildered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's good, and only at times like this, she feels like the protagonist, a person in control, deciding others' lives!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like going back to childhood, she became the princess of the Reed family, feeling like a person in control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I can give you a choice, you can give up one of these two women, choose one, the one you give up will naturally fall into the sea and be fed to the sharks, and the one you choose will be released as soon as I reach a safe place!" Irene said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene's behavior at this moment was completely fearless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace's face suddenly changed when she heard what Irene said, and her body trembled uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The terrifying memory buried deep in her memory resurfaced once again.</p></div>
