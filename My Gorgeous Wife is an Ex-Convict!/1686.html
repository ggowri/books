        <h1>Chapter 1684</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the song ended, many people around them applauded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only Jasper looked at the little boy suspiciously before walking up to him and asking, "Why did you play badly on purpose when you can play very well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as she said this, the other adults said, "Little girl, the little boy played beautifully. Don't talk nonsense!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, he played pretty well. This music score is difficult to play. Even someone who has been playing the piano for years can hardly play it well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But he made mistakes on purpose!" muttered Jasper as she gazed at the little boy, wanting to know why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy ignored what Jasper said and got down from the chair, planning to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper Reed's little hand caught the little boy's hand. "Could you play it again? Play it well, and don't make mistakes on purpose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy scowled, planning to shake her hand away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jasper held a tight grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace saw this and was about to ask her daughter to let go when another small figure rushed toward Jasper and the little boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Oriel Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jasper Reed, he played so well. Why did you say he played it badly? You just think you're the best," said Oriel Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She hated having Jasper steal the spotlight. Besides, she had learned piano before. Her piano teacher had always complimented her on her performance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she had only heard her teacher play the tune the boy played before. She had no idea how to play it! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her teacher had also said that only those who had learned to play the piano for many years could play that piece well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The boy must be a genius to play so well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch only spoke up to embarrass Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wanna, how could you say that about Jasper?" Irene Lynch walked up and asked her daughter. Then, she gave Grace and Jason an apologetic look. "There must be a reason for Jasper to say that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What reason can there be? She&rsquo;s just simply saying it. If she has the skills, then she should play the same piece!&rdquo; Oriel Lynch pouted and said, "She's criticizing others when she can&rsquo;t play the piece herself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jasper, I'm sorry. Oriel just thinks it's wrong to criticize others at will. Don't mind her," Irene Lynch said kindly, working hard to maintain her gentle image.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper did not want to talk to Irene Lynch at all. She only turned to the little boy and said, "Can I point out your mistakes if I play the same piece?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked at him. Her almond-shaped eyes were pure and innocent. The words she spoke were straightforward as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy pressed his lips tightly together and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then don't leave. I'll play it for you," said Jasper before letting go of his hand and walking toward the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The onlookers around them could not help but say, "Oh, do kids nowadays think if others can play a song like that, they can play it too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Does she think she can play it after a few days of piano lessons?"</p></div>
