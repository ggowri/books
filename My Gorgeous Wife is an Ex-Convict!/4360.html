        <h1>Chapter 4358 The Gap Between Classes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Calvert's house was even more rundown than she had imagined, with a musty smell wafting through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Calvert turned on the light, Harley surveyed the room. Many of the old pieces of furniture looked somewhat damaged. There were quite a few cabinets with only half a door, or with door handles that were only half there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such living conditions could have been described as extremely harsh. However, when one looked at Calvert, it wasn't possible to associate him with such an environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert himself had an excellent physique. Even when he was dressed in ordinary, cheap clothes, he exuded an air of elegance, like a noble prince fallen on hard times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My place is a bit modest," Calvert said, seemingly a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you plan on moving to a different house in the future?" Harley asked. After all, no matter how you look at it, this place doesn't seem quite suitable for comfortable living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I graduate from university, if I have the means, I'll move away from here," Calvert said, then chuckled self-deprecatingly. "But it's also possible that I might never be able to leave this place. After all, it's hard to cross social classes. Many children of the poor remain poor forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would you think that?" Harley asked, looking at the other person in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" He was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A child born into poverty doesn't necessarily have to stay poor forever. Isn't the reason you're going to college to change your fate?" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew very well how hard it was for an ordinary person with no family background to get into her current university and receive a full scholarship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Calvert's family situation, he could only afford to attend this university if he received a full scholarship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing her words, he shuddered slightly, lowering his head and murmuring, "I guess it was in high school when I thought good grades could determine a lot of things. But when I got to college, I realized I was a bit naive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of his classmates around him were wealthy and influential people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert slowly began to understand that in the eyes of those people, he was nothing more than a clown. Even though he had good grades, he had no background, and his family was poor. Trying to change his own fate was just too difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though some girls were drawn to Calvert because of his looks and tried to win his favor, they only saw him as a temporary source of amusement. They didn't really intend to have a long-term relationship with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think having good grades is great, it shows you're smart," Harley said. "Someone as intelligent as you, as long as you're willing to work hard, you're bound to succeed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert suddenly froze, slowly lifting his head. What came into view was Harley's handsome and radiant face, showing not a hint of insincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you." It took Calvert quite a while to say that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, what happened to the ointment I gave you last time?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over here." He walked over to a worn-out cabinet and pulled out an ointment from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got a wound on your face. You'd better apply something to it quickly. That way, it </span><span>might not be so noticeable tomorrow," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Calvert responded, only to find Harley's gaze still firmly fixed on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stared at to the point where he started to feel a bit embarrassed.</span></p></div>
