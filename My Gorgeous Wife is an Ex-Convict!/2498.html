        <h1>Chapter 2496</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, she thought she would never have children of her own, but she now had three lovely children and there was more on the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps the universe had taken pity on her, after all. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you're pregnant, you're not in the right condition to fly. I&rsquo;ll drive you back to Emerald City," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Thanks, but Jay had asked the driver and bodyguards to stay in Deer City. I'll just ask the Reed family's driver to drive me back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flash of gloom in Brian's eyes. She wanted to draw the line between them. Was she afraid that Jason would misunderstand if he sent her home?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian could not help smiling faintly at the thought of this. "Alright, I won't see you off, then. Be careful and stay safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not long after, a black Bentley stopped at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance. Grace got into the car, and the driver drove Grace to Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stood blankly at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance. Looking at the car that gradually disappeared from his sight, the curve on his lips faded. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked at Brian in a trance and understood that Brian was reluctant to part with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had it not been for Grace, Brian probably would not have helped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was an outstanding man, but sometimes, love was not about excellence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell could not help but recall Herman Moss's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Herman had once asked her, "Will you choose me if I become better than George Gregory one day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What had she replied then? She said, "Even so, I&rsquo;ll still love George. Herman, I don't love you. George is the man I want to be with forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Forever... Unfortunately, fate gave her a hard slap in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's voice and face became increasingly blurry in her memory during her years in the mental hospital. However, Herman's face, every word he said, and the things he had done became more vivid in her mind as if they were branded in her blood and bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, do you want to go back?" Amber Mitchell asked politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go ahead. I want to stay here a little longer," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'll go home first," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I'll be staying in Deer City for a while. Let me know if you need anything," Brian said abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shock flashed across Amber Mitchell's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if explaining her doubts, he said, "Since Grace has chosen to help you, I&rsquo;ll help you as well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell froze. 'Is it just because of that? The man should know that if I have to seek his help, it won&rsquo;t be for an easy task. After all, what I'm doing now is making enemies of the Gregory  and Mitchell families.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These two families had deep roots in Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian was still willing to make such a promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But doesn't it matter that you&rsquo;ll get nothing in return for helping me?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elegant voice said indifferently, "My reward is her happiness." This was the answer he gave her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
