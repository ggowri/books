        <h1>Chapter 3856</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason pursed his lips and gazed at Veronica. After a moment, he spoke gently, "Okay, let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them walked out of the meeting room, and they could still faintly hear Daniel's shouting from inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they got into the car, Veronica looked at Mason and suddenly said, "I won't regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was taken aback, but then understood that she was responding to what Daniel had said to him earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really believe that my feelings for you won't change in the future?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I didn't believe it, I wouldn't be with you now," Veronica said. "Mason, we've been together for so long, from childhood to adolescence, and now. You should be the person I've spent the most time with in my life. Why wouldn't I believe in us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, he turned to her and hugged her, "I love you, Veronica."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A simple sentence, but the most heartfelt confession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The following days were busy for Veronica. First, the Reed family held a press conference for her, announcing her relationship with Mason and also announcing the severing of ties with the Barlow family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, the so-called severing of ties was only verbal and had no legal significance, but it sent a signal to others: the Reed family had nothing to do with the Barlow family's debts, and they wouldn't help them in any way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, many people criticized the Reed family for being too powerful. They not only refused to help their future in-laws, but also made their future daughter-in-law sever ties with her own family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people also attacked Veronica, accusing her of abandoning her family in order to marry into a wealthy family. They called her heartless and cruel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the comments full of accusations and insults, Veronica was filled with worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wasn't worried about herself, after all, severing ties with her family was her own decision. But she was afraid that it would affect the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family had helped her too much, and she didn't want them to be criticized because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other hand, Mason didn't care about the online comments and said to Veronica, "Don't worry, everything will be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family had naturally made full preparations for these possible situations. Afterwards, some posts appeared online, mainly about the Barlow family's borrowing situation in recent years and the help that the Reed family had given to the Barlow family in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They also made a clear comparison between the Barlow family's initial situation and their situation after receiving help from the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people who had lent money to the Barlow family even appeared online, saying that Mr. Barlow and his wife had been borrowing money and seeking investments everywhere under the guise of the Reed family, and had cheated many people. They also refused to repay the money and claimed that they had a relationship with the Reed family, which made many people who had lent them money but had no power, afraid to demand repayment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, the unethical things that Archer and Rosalind had done were all exposed online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even some of Rosalind's friends said that Rosalind played cards all day long, and that the Barlow family's wealth was originally enough for them to live a comfortable life, but Rosalind had lost all of it on the card table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer, on the other hand, frequented those places of pleasure and had many affairs with various women.</p></div>
