        <h1>Chapter 2610</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could have asked someone else to do it for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, you&rsquo;re still my wife. We're still married, and the people here should understand that," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt her heart melt. He had always been this way. He would not say much but would express himself through his actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After this, the servants in the mansion probably would not dare disrespect her again. At least not until they divorced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thanks," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thanks?" He seemed slightly surprised. She was disrespected in the mansion because of him. He was only giving her the respect she deserved, yet she was earnestly thanking him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, did you and my mother have some deal? What's this about the promise you made her at the hospital?" Martin Weiss asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla tensed up suddenly. Her hands hanging at her sides could not help grabbing the hem of her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had heard a good deal of her conversation with his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How was she going to tell him that his mother had got on her knees to beg her to leave him? How would he react when he found out?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;re not going to tell me?" Due to her long silence, he said, "I can figure it out even if you don't tell me. My mother must have asked you to leave me when I got injured and hospitalized to save you. She must&rsquo;ve offered you something in exchange. What did she give you? Money? Or the condition that the Weiss family won't fight for the children's custody in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shock flashed across Kyla's face. That expression was enough to let Martin Weiss know that he was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss smiled lightly and said, "I guess I got it right. Kyla, you said you wanted to separate from me because you were afraid of dragging me down, but now it seems that there was more to it than that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, your mother asked me to leave you, but I didn't ask for anything in exchange. I chose to separate because&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He interrupted her and said, "Because of what? Do you dare say that my mother had nothing to do with your decision to separate from me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was speechless. Mrs. Weiss indeed had something to do with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Mrs. Weiss had not begged her like that, maybe she would not have overthought it. Maybe she would already be with him, and he would not have chosen to undergo hypnosis...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Various causes and effects intertwined with each other to form today's situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Look. You said you love me, but you could easily choose to leave me because of another person. It doesn't seem like you love me very much," Martin Weiss said mockingly as his deep eyes looked at Kyla. However, no one knew what was on his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla met Martin Weiss's eyes. "Do you think I don't love you all that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn&rsquo;t that the case?" He sneered. "Three months will soon pass. Then we won't have to see each other anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as he was about to walk away, Kyla's suppressed emotions seemed to suddenly burst out. Ignoring the pain in her ankle, she got up, grabbed Martin Weiss, and pushed him to the bed with a sudden force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face was full of shock. By the time he came to his senses, Kyla had already pressed both hands on his sides and bent over to look at him. He was underneath her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tears had welled up in her dark eyes at some point. It was as if those tears would escape at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you doubt my love for you that much?" Kyla sobbed. Her throat was full of bitterness, and she did not know how to vent it.</p></div>
