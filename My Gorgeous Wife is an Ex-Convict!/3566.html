        <h1>Chapter 3564</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Deliberately?" Jasper pondered. If they were deliberately hiding something, there must be something they didn't want people to know!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, will you help me find out about Roger before he was 14?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll try, but back then Roger didn't go out much. He mostly stayed at home or in the hospital. Patient information in hospitals is confidential and not easily leaked. If you really want to find out about his life before he was 14, you might have to find his old teachers or the Elliott family's former servants," William said. "But it's been so many years, it's not easy to find them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, try your best to find out," suddenly, Jasper thought of something else, "Also... I remember that after Lawrence's parents died, the police kept DNA samples. If we can get Lawrence's hair or blood, we can use DNA testing to find out if he is really Lawrence, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Indeed we can," William said, "Shall I try to find a way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me handle it," Jasper said, "He probably won't let you get close after your confrontation at the last social event. I'm a woman, so he shouldn't be too guarded against me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You?" William frowned. "How are you going to do it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can pull out a strand of his hair while he's asleep or something," Jasper suggested. She regretted not taking the opportunity earlier when she saw him sleeping in the music room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's expression changed. "Are you planning to sneak into the boys' dormitory and pull his hair while he's asleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper choked on her saliva. "How could I possibly sneak into the boys' dormitory?!" Even if she wanted to, she didn't have the ability to do so!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then how do you plan to do it?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I haven't figured it out yet, but I'll find an opportunity," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William looked at Jasper and said, "Regardless, what you need to do is protect yourself, you know? Roger is not a simple person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, if that person really is Lawrence, then it's incredibly dangerous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know!" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she didn't know how to get a DNA sample from Roger. Although there were many types of samples, such as cigarette butts, used toothbrushes, cups, blood, and so on, many of them were not accessible to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was squatting downstairs of the Chemistry Department building, trying to think of the method she would use later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't difficult to get Roger's schedule. She almost didn't have to put in any effort to get it. Therefore, she calculated the time and Roger should be coming down soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, shortly after the bell rang, Roger walked out of the building. Jasper quickly approached him and shouted, "Roger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stopped walking and looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, he thought that after the last time, she wouldn't appear in front of him for a while. However, he didn't expect that she would come to him so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She ran a few steps and approached him, "Do you have a moment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's up?" he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think there might be some misunderstanding between us. How about I treat you to some bubble tea? There's a shop near the school that makes really good bubble tea." As she spoke, her eyes were eager and hopeful, even a bit anxious as if she feared he might refuse.</p></div>
