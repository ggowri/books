        <h1>Chapter 2738</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are too many things here," Kyla could not help saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like Trista, so I want to give her more!" Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little hungry after they left the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, remember that small noodle shop you used to run? It's now a small restaurant. I saw it once when I was passing by. Why don't we go there for lunch? It's nearby anyway," suggested Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla agreed. Speaking of which, she might not have met Grace if she had not opened that small noodle shop. Her life would have been more miserable if that were the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They went to the small restaurant, which was no longer the same small noodle shop. The furnishings inside and the menu were also different, but there were noodles on the menu.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla and Grace smiled at each other. Having good rapport, they both chose noodles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson was so young when I met you here." Grace gestured the height of three-year-old Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it was very hard at that time, but I still survived. Life is now much better than it was then. What else can I not get over?" Kyla lamented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While they chatted, Grace suddenly caught sight of a figure out of the corners of her eyes and paused slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Kyla followed her best friend's gaze with some doubt. Grace was looking at a woman dressed in casual clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had a short ponytail and a comely round face. She looked clean and adorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is she someone you know?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, Brian's girlfriend that I told you about," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Valda Theller also looked over at Grace as if sensing their gazes. She was slightly surprised when she saw Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, what a coincidence," greeted Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, what a coincidence." Valda Theller smiled sheepishly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you sit down and eat with us?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller replied in acknowledgment and ordered for donburi with the restaurant owner before going to Grace's table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, this is my friend Kyla," introduced Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Miss Corbyn," Valda Theller said politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled. "I should be a few years older than you. You can call me Kyla like Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you can also call me Valda," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's cordial attitude gave Kyla a good impression of her. Valda Theller was not stunningly beautiful, but she looked friendly. Perhaps it was why she could become Brian's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Kyla knew how much Brian loved Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I didn't expect you to eat here, Grace," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I used to work here when this small restaurant was a small noodle shop, and Kyla was the owner," said Grace before looking at Valda Theller. "Do you work around here?"</p></div>
