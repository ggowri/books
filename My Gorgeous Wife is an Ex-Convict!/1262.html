        <h1>Chapter 1261</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said calmly, "I don't need money, and I'm not getting a divorce. I'm not having the babies for the Reed family. I'm having these three babies for myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she wanted to be their mother and have her own family. She hoped these three little lives could come to the world and experience it! That was why she was risking her life to have these three babies! It was not for anyone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed coughed as if he was angered. "Do you think you can stay with him forever? You'll want to leave him one day!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I swore in front of his father's tablet that I'll be a good wife, stay by his side forever, and never leave him," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed's face was full of mockery. "You'll never leave him. That sounds nice. What a pity. If you knew..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door to the ward was pushed open. A figure quickly rushed in and went to Grace's side a little nervously. "Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surprised that Jason came over so quickly. "I'm fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her gaze turned to Old Master Reed and she said, "Old Master, I should call you &lsquo;Grandpa&rsquo;, but maybe I will only annoy you if I do. I can tell you that I will never leave him no matter what I find out, much less get a divorce and abort the three babies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason immediately trembled when she said this. He seemed to think of something and looked sharply at Old Master Reed. 'Was... he about to tell Grace the truth about the case?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only the truth of that car accident would make him panic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandpa, if you said or did some things you shouldn't have said or done, then..." Jason's voice suddenly grew cold. "I'll make sure the Reed family goes down together! I'll keep my word!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed's half-opened eyes suddenly widened as he glared at his grandson with a ferocious look in his eyes. "If... If... Cough... If you dare destroy the Reed family, I won't let you go... for as long as I live..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed spoke with difficulty. He gasped for breath after only a few words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary hurried to help Old Master Reed calm down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said coldly, "Also, don't touch the three babies in Grace's belly. If you dare touch even a single hair of Grace and the three babies, then the Reed family will go heirless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed choked and glared at the grandson he had raised by himself. He was indeed cruel and cold-blooded enough to say such threatening words to his own grandfather!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was not for this woman named Grace, then his grandson would be the Reed family's perfect heir!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, his grandson's feelings for Grace were too deep. She would become his fetters and weakness if his feelings for her were too deep!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed calmed himself down. "You'll suffer the consequences for caring too much about this woman one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together and said lightly, "Grandpa, such a thing can never happen again! Otherwise, I'll make the Reed family go down together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he took Grace's hand and quickly walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed closed his eyes and murmured, "You'll be sorry for this. You'll be sorry! You&rsquo;ll probably end up like your father! I... won't let a woman destroy the Reed family. No way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said nothing on the way back. He slightly lowered his eyes. His dark eyes made people wonder what was on his mind right now.</p></div>
