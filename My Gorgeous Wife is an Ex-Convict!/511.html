        <h1>Chapter 510</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she muttered. Women always liked pretty things. How could she not like such a pretty gown? However... "It's probably expensive. It&rsquo;ll be a waste to wear this only once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she meant was that there were cheaper options.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he heard this, he said, "If you think it's a waste, just accompany me to more banquets so that it won&rsquo;t be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Grace was so stunned that she had nothing to retort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace's hand and said, "All right, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The temperature of his hand passed to her palm. She gently responded to him before standing up. Then, she followed him out of the room and came downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outside the main house, the car was already prepared. Jason held Grace's hand as he got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On their way there, Grace could not help looking at Jason who was wearing a formal black suit, white shirt, and dark purple tie. He looked smart and fresh, and it suited him very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had a sharp jawline that was rare among Asians and delicate features. His black hair was styled neatly while his bangs were combed back to reveal his beautiful forehead. The curve of his neck was lost in the neckline of his shirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the collar of his shirt was loosened a little, she might see his collarbone. As Grace thought about it, the shape of his collarbone flashed in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, his collarbone was beautiful. She had never thought that one day she would use the word &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; on a man's collarbone, but it seemed so natural and fitting for her to describe his collarbone as beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Below his collarbone... Grace's mind went back to that night when she saw every inch of his body. She had felt his temperature and presence. It was so crazy... It was something she had never imagined before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The blood flow in her body seemed to be accelerating, and her cheeks were getting hotter and hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Oh my God! Stop thinking about it!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said to herself. Suddenly, she heard an elegant voice in her ears. "What's on your mind, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mutter, as if with endless temptation, caused Grace to stiffen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was on her mind... How could she tell him that? Should she tell him that she was thinking of his body?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Grace's face turned even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your face is so red." With a slight chill, his fingers touched her cheek. The temperature difference made it even more obvious how hot her face was now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe... it's just too hot in the car." Grace made up a random excuse and turned away, trying to avoid his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his fingers gently grabbed her jaw, half-forcing her to keep her face straight at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why won't you look at me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No," she said guiltily, even more so when she looked into his amorous eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No?" His face was close to hers, and his breath was like a fragrant orchid. "You know what? You look like you're embarrassed to look at me. Why? Are you thinking about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Exactly! Grace bit her lip slightly, not knowing how to rebut him. His eyes seemed to be able to read people easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't bite your lip. It'll ruin your makeup," he muttered as his lips gently got closer to the corner of her mouth. "What are you thinking of? Let me guess... Are you blushing like this because you were reminded of our intimate moments?"</p></div>
