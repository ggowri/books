        <h1>Chapter 2408</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace let out a low cry and was instantly pulled into the hotel elevator by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What&rsquo;s your room number?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gave him the floor level and the room number. Then, his finger pressed the elevator button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the elevator doors closed, she looked at the person before her as the air pressure seemed to drop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I can explain if you&rsquo;re misunderstanding something,&rdquo; said Grace. She did not expect Brian to follow her taxi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s dark peach blossom eyes looked at her as he gently said, "What misunderstanding?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he really not misunderstand?' She was doubtful after looking at his expression and feeling the low air pressure around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the elevator doors opened, he took her hand and walked quickly out of the elevator to her room door. "What's the password?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She obediently gave him the password. The next moment, the door opened and he took her into the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you&rsquo;re not having a misunderstanding, why are you..." His lips were pressed against hers before she finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss was so intense that she could hardly react and could only take it passively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed her body against the wall with his arms pressed on the wall, trapping her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could smell was his scent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea how long it took before the kiss was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't misunderstand. I know you love me and won't have anything to do with Brian." His cold voice rang in her ears somewhat hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked up at him. Her face was reflected in his beautiful peach blossom eyes. His long black eyelashes fluttered slightly, while his sexy thin lips were under his straight nose bridge... However, there seemed to be a touch of unease on his beautiful face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you feeling uneasy?" she asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shock flickered in his eyes before understanding took over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, she probably knows me better than anyone in the world. How can she not see that I'm feeling uneasy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"... Yeah." The word escaped from his thin lips as an acknowledgment of his unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her hand and gently pressed it against his cheek. Her warm hand rubbed against his cheek sentimentally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, since you know I won't have anything to do with Brian, why would you feel uneasy? What can I do to make you feel reassured?" she asked. She would do anything to reassure him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe I'm afraid that you would one day sympathize with him and have pity on him. Or maybe because we were separated for five years, after all. Even though you've come back to me, I still find it hard to believe sometimes. I'm afraid you&rsquo;ll leave me one day," he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that his unease stemmed from his childhood. The trauma was buried in his bones and blood. Besides, she had returned to his side for only over a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it would take time for him to feel at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe she could only reassure him after five years... ten years... or even 20 years.</p></div>
