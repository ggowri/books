        <h1>Chapter 799</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she had reversed her case, she could resume her practice as a lawyer. However, she knew how hard it would be for her to resume her career as a lawyer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if the law had proved her innocence, her imprisonment would still become an invisible obstacle to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, how many clients would believe in the competence of a lawyer who could get herself unjustly imprisoned for three years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, her case was well known in the legal community, but more people treated her case as something to talk about after dinner. They were only interested in her experience rather than trusting her ability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like this time, she submitted a lot of resumes on the internet, but in the end, only this law firm called her for an interview today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I still have to try my best no matter what!' Grace said to herself. After all, being a lawyer was her dream from a long time ago, and she had been striving for it all along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she walked to the reception, Grace said to the receptionist, "Hello, I'm Grace. I made an appointment to interview for the position of a paralegal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she was once hailed as one of the most promising new lawyers, she had to start as a basic paralegal when she re-entered the field after a few years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, please wait for a moment. Lawyer Carter is interviewing other people right now. You can take a seat and have a rest," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat in a nearby chair and waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang out. "Grace, what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up and was surprised to see the person in front of her. It was&hellip; Andrea Schwartz, a colleague from her former law firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz had given her a lot of trouble in the past, even using her case as a case study to new colleagues at the firm before her case was reversed in an attempt to humiliate her in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not see Andrea Schwartz again after that. She heard that she was fired by the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect to see Andrea Schwartz here again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz glared at Grace, her heart full of hatred! 'Would I have been fired if it hadn't been for Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After being fired, no law firm was willing to hire her. In the end, she had to pull some strings and ended up spending a lot of money just to join this firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but feel jealous at the thought of the glitz and glam Grace received for dating Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was an ex-convict. Even if she was wronged, how could she be worthy of a man like Jason? On the other hand, she lost her job and almost broke up with her boyfriend because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had found a new job as a lawyer, her treatment was nowhere near as good as the previous one. Even her future husband's family found her annoying during this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However&hellip;' Andrea Schwartz looked at Grace, and she was full of doubts. Since Grace was with Jason, it was only normal that she wore luxury brands!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the person in front of her was wearing old clothes. Plus, the front part of the shoes on her feet was obviously torn. The bag she was carrying was also cheap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was thinking about it, the receptionist came over and said to Grace, "Miss Cummins, it's your turn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright," replied Grace before heading to the conference room for the interview.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz grabbed the receptionist and asked about Grace. She was somewhat surprised when she learned that Grace was here for an interview today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Interview? Grace is interviewing for a paralegal position?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Grace wants to return to doing law, all she has to do is to tell Jason. Why bother going through all the trouble? Or&hellip;'</p></div>
