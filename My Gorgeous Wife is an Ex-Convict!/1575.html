        <h1>Chapter 1573</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Compared to the previous sales assistant, the manager's attitude was much better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Get me a new sales assistant. Since this sales assistant doesn't want to serve me, then there's no need to force her," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm sorry you had a bad experience." The manager apologized and called for another staff member who looked young.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace glanced at the name tag pinned to their chest. They were a junior sales assistant, probably someone who had just started working in the boutique.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She smiled and briefly told them what she was looking for as well as the colors she liked. The rookie sales assistant started helping Grace look for suitable gowns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said, "That's it? That staff member earlier wasn&rsquo;t even remotely professional."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "That person isn't even afraid of complaints. If she's not afraid, why bother? Don't worry, she'll be sorry in a minute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina appeared to be thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the rookie sales assistant came over and told Grace that there were several gowns that would suit her. However, one of them was a limited edition and she was not in a position to let Grace try it on. However, Grace could have a look at it first. She would ask the manager if Grace liked it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at the photo of the gown the sales assistant showed to her. It was a black gown that looked elegant and mysterious. Due to the diamond inlays, the black dress did not look monotonous. One could even call it dazzling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was the perfect gown for her first appearance in five years! Lina said with amazement, "Wow, Grace! It's even better than the silver one you had your eye on earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll take it. I like it and I want to try it on," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, wait a minute, please," the sales assistant said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a while, they brought the black dress over and led Grace to the fitting room. Lina sat in a chair in the lounge and waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Lina saw a figure walk into the boutique. The sales assistant who had mistreated them earlier greeted them with a respectful and warm attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Lynch, you&rsquo;re here. I've been waiting for you. What do you plan to buy today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I came to look at the gowns. I saw a black limited edition gown that looked pretty good in the brochure you sent me," said Irene Lynch as she enjoyed the sales assistant&rsquo;s meticulous service.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was the boss here, and these people had to respect her. She could now afford the things she could not afford before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was also qualified to buy the limited edition items from these luxury brands!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, have a seat. Let me show you the dress first," the sales assistant said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch went to the lounge area. She frowned a little when she saw Lina. She recognized that she was the same friend who was with Grace last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What are you doing here?" asked Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina shrugged and asked, "If you can be here, why can't I?"</p></div>
