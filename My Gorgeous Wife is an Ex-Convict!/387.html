        <h1>Chapter 386</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All he wanted from the very beginning was for her to be willing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as time went on, he wanted more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to like him more. He wanted her to like no other man except him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not even accept the possibility that her future would involve another man besides him. Every time he thought of this possibility, he would be filled with a pang of jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jealousy... It was because of her that he finally knew what jealousy felt like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her eyes and looked at Jason carefully. His hand was hot against her cheek, and the details of his time with her these days kept coming back to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she somehow still feared him, perhaps she liked him as he had said in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she liked him when he was Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want me to like you?" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he answered without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What kind of feelings do you have for me? Is it because you think I'm new? Therefore... I'm a good game object?" She plucked up her courage to ask her innermost question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes darkened, and he suddenly sneered. "If I&rsquo;m only taking you as a game object, I wouldn't have done all this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He grabbed the back of her head with his hand, drawing them closer together. "I haven't had many people to love in my life, except perhaps my father. You're the only one left. Tell me, how should I feel about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pang! Pang! Pang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart was beating more violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gently raised her hands and put them on both of Jason's cheeks as if to get a clearer sense of his presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body suddenly stiffened. He looked into her eyes with some sort of wonder, vague excitement, and longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like you, Jay." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time she confessed her affection to his face after knowing his true identity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, when Grace opened her eyes, she saw Jason sitting on the edge of her bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was wearing a white shirt and beige pants. The morning sun fell on him, making him look more clean and fresh, just like the fairytale prince in every girl's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, her eyes met his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you awake?" His elegant voice rang in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sat up with a jerk and gawked at him. "What are you... doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I have something to check with you," he said as he leaned forward, raising his hand to gently pull a few strands of hair from her cheek. He tucked them behind her ear. "That's why I came to your room early in the morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want to check?" Her mouth was suddenly dry, and the visual impact of looking at him so closely was even greater. His eyes, his breath, and his voice seemed to tantalize her so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you liked me last night, remember?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face turned red again, and the memories of last night began to flow into her mind. "I remember..." she muttered as she bit her lip with her teeth.</p></div>
