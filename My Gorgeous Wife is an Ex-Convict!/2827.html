        <h1>Chapter 2825</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Disappointment flashed across Valda Theller's eyes. 'Yeah, what am I thinking? How could a man like him fall in love with another person so easily?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his next statement turned the disappointment in her eyes into shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I think I like you," the elegant voice said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... like me?" Valda Theller asked in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think I'd let you kiss me if I didn&rsquo;t like you, and I don't think I'd let you force yourself on me either," Brian said slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would have been disgusted if another woman had said these.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was only amused when she said those words. He even had the impulse to satisfy her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never had this feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller only felt her heart beating quickly. What he just said was like music to her ears. "Do you really like me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was excitement and anticipation in her big, round eyes, but they seemed to contain wariness too. It was as if she feared the answer would be no.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart broke a little. He seemed to have seen the old him in her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to have expectations for Grace, yet he was wary. However... he never got any response romantically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because the person Grace loved had always been Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian leaned over and kissed Valda Theller on the lips. "Does this make you believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's pupils constricted suddenly as she stiffened in response to this sudden kiss. His lips were soft and warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She still wanted more when his lips left hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Still don't believe me?" he asked, looking at her eyes fixed on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I believe you, but... uhh... Can you kiss me again?" What she just felt was so unreal that she felt as if she were dreaming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Valda Theller, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Then, he bent over and gently kissed her on the lips again. "Is this enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed and licked her lips. "Can... Can I kiss you too?" She did not want it to end and wanted more. She wanted this feeling to linger longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes froze as his thin sexy lips slowly said, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he finished speaking, she put her hands around his neck and carefully kissed his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unlike the previous kisses, this was a kiss they shared after he grew to have feelings for her. Would these feelings grow and become love?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, like me more, okay?" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll make myself like you more." He made a promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He also wanted to fall in love with her! Would he be happier if he fell for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The original plan was to stay at the hotel for a few hours until their clothes were washed and dried before returning to tMason Swansonty. However, she and Brian stayed at the hotel overnight.</p></div>
