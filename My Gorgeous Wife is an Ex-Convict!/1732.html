        <h1>Chapter 1730</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her condescendingly. "Lina, I can't pretend nothing happened! You forced yourself on me last night. Are you trying to get away without taking any responsibility again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her face instantly went red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew that the word &lsquo;again&rsquo; referred to how she had a drunken passionate night with him and left the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she later got together with him when he found her three years later. Now... she was not the same person she was, and he... was not the same person he was too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina did not know how she walked out of Hadwin Stephenson's mansion. She stumbled into a taxi and went back to the design office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She worked as usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, different thoughts clouded her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A colleague exclaimed, "Huh? Lina, this outfit you're wearing is from X&rsquo;s latest collection. Gosh, I've seen the clothes in a magazine, and they&rsquo;re worth over 300,000 bucks!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The colleague's exclamation immediately caught the attention of many colleagues, especially some female colleagues who were sizing up Lina's clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was scared to say that the sweater she was wearing underneath actually cost more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"An outfit that costs 300,000 bucks? Wow, no wonder I thought Lina was pretty dressed up today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Luxury brands are just different. Their designs are amazing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, how do you have money to buy such clothes?" Some colleagues were also curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"They&rsquo;re counterfeit. How could I possibly afford such luxury clothes?" Lina hurriedly made up an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Counterfeit... But they look pretty good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could only chuckle drily. She frowned after her colleagues dispersed. As these clothes were too expensive, the dry cleaning fee would probably cost a lot as well. Regardless, she still had to return them to Hadwin Stephenson...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina recalled what Hadwin Stephenson said before she left his mansion. "If you want to return the clothes to me, don't deliver them to me by a courier service. Return them yourself. Otherwise, you can just toss them in the trash can."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Returning them to him herself meant she had to see him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina wanted to wail at the thought of this. It would be so awkward to see him again, but she... dared not throw clothes that cost hundreds of thousands of bucks into the trash can.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It's just one more time anyway. I'm never letting myself get drunk again!' she told herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson sat at his desk in the president&rsquo;s office of Stephenson Group. He rubbed his fingers on a photo of a person who was seen smiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson murmured, "Lina... Tell me, is what I'm going to do worth it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The office phone rang, and the secretary's voice sounded. "President, Miss Jackson wants to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, let her in," Hadwin Stephenson said indifferently. There was no trace of surprise in his tone as if he had been expecting Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson walked into the president's office and saw Hadwin Stephenson sitting comfortably on the couch. He looked as composed and elegant as if everything was already under his control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How could I have thought he was easy to handle?' Katherine Jackson once again lamented for being so naive.</p></div>
