        <h1>Chapter 3655</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, now that it has been confirmed that Roger is Lawrence, it's a good thing. At least he really is alive as you wished," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's a good thing that he's alive!" Jasper murmured. Even if Lawrence blamed her and hated her, it didn't matter as long as he was still alive. "William, what should I do to make it up to him? Even if he doesn't forgive me, it doesn't matter. After all, I really did something wrong back then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened back then was not your fault. It's Lawrence's business to blame you, but you shouldn't shoulder this responsibility on your own!" William said, "Back then, you were just a child, how much impact could you have? The death of his parents was ultimately because they borrowed high-interest loans for gambling! It was their own responsibility!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." she hesitated, "If I hadn't insisted on finding him after hearing Lawrence's piano sound, maybe there wouldn't have been so many things later..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But have you ever thought that because you found Lawrence back then, their family was able to improve their lives? If his parents could manage their lives well and not gamble, then their family's life would be very good. You gave them the opportunity to change their fate, but they turned their fate into what it is now!" William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper actually knew the truth of what William said. It's just that over the years, she has been shrouded in guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really want to make it up to Lawrence, then help him when he is in trouble in the future. In this world, it's easy to add flowers to the brocade, but difficult to send charcoal in the snow," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Jason said to his daughter, "Do you know that Roger is Lawrence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I understand," Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what are your plans?" Jason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he needs my help with anything, I will do everything in my power to assist him," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not the same Lawrence as before. He returned to Emerald City, deliberately hiding his identity, and no one knows what he wants to do. And... he seems to blame all his past mistakes on you. Do you still want to help him?" Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, I was the one who abandoned him. Regardless, I feel guilty in my heart," </span><span>she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although everyone around her told her that she wasn't at fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she understood all the reasons she should let go of her guilt, she couldn't reduce it even a little bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How long will you be so foolish, my child?" Jason felt sorry for his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper lowered her head. Yes, she was indeed very foolish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even though she knew he might not be good for her, she still wanted to do something for Lawrence!</span></p></div>
