        <h1>Chapter 3233</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Kyla returned to her residence, Martin was sitting in the living room flipping through a magazine. When he saw her come back, he was slightly surprised and said, "Didn't we agree that you would call me when you were on your way back so I could come pick you up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, it's convenient for me to take a taxi myself, so you don't have to run around," Kyla said. "Are my mom and the kids already asleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, everyone's already asleep," he said. "You should go take a shower first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, are you free tomorrow? I want you to accompany me to a place," Kyla suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where to?" asked Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to wear a wedding dress once and take a wedding photo with you," Kyla said. "After all these years and two children, I still haven't properly worn a wedding dress for you or taken a serious wedding photo. So, I want to make up for this regret."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry, I didn't think about it that much," Martin stood up and said. "But would it be too rushed if we do it tomorrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems so," Kyla chuckled. "So if you're willing, we can go to the bridal photography shop tomorrow to confirm the shooting time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," said Martin, "why did you suddenly decide to take wedding photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today when I went to Amber's place, I ran into Valda and Brian. Seeing their newlywed appearance, I felt they were very happy. On the way back in the taxi, we happened to see someone taking photos of wedding night scenes on the roadside. I thought about taking some wedding photos myself to fulfill a regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If this is a regret, do you have any other regrets, Kyla? What I owe you is more than just wedding photos," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They haven't even had a real wedding ceremony, they just obtained a marriage certificate from tMason Swansonvil affairs bureau.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla glanced deeply at Martin and said, "If we're talking about having a wedding ceremony again, let's wait for a while. If you still think it's necessary by then, we can have a wedding ceremony."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her with some confusion, "Why, do you think I will change my mind in a while?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "I just feel that having a wedding ceremony is a big deal, unlike taking wedding photos which can be done in just one day as long as both parties agree. A wedding ceremony, on the other hand, requires more than just a day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin responded to Kyla's words by saying, "Okay, then let's postpone the wedding for a while and have it later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Kyla and Martin went to a wedding photography shop. This shop is one of the top wedding photography shops in Emerald City, and the wedding dresses available for selection are the works of many well-known designers from both domestic and international markets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla was very decisive in choosing what to shoot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for the clothing, Martin's suit and such, there's no need to worry about that. She just needs to choose her own wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Kyla did not choose a wedding dress that she liked at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe it's because she looked at too many wedding dresses at once and lost her feeling, or maybe it's because this wedding photo shoot has a special meaning to her, so she doesn't want to make a casual choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff standing nearby saw that Kyla had been picking for a long time without finding anything she liked, so they suggested, "Why don't you take a look at our haute couture collection? However, if you're interested in those wedding dresses, you'll need to purchase them directly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, they are not part of those that are only meant for wearing and taking photos outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, many of the guests who come here are well-known figures and naturally wouldn't want their wedding photos to clash with others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla naturally understands that these haute couture pieces are definitely valuable.</p></div>
