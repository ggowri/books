        <h1>Chapter 3626</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only keep telling himself that maybe she was just acting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as a princess from a prominent family, she had been exposed to various media since childhood. It was only natural for her to put on a show in front of the media, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later, everything he saw in the bamboo forest completely shattered this thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kissed William so passionately and professed her love for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, she truly fell in love with William!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what about him...what was his motive for all of this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it just to make Jasper fall into William's embrace? To ensure that these childhood sweethearts become a couple?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Roger felt a sense of regret. He shouldn't have taken this step!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't, maybe she wouldn't have started dating William so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night grew darker and the streets became emptier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger didn't know how long he had been walking when suddenly, someone blocked his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, young man, all alone?" A woman's voice echoed in his ears, and when he looked up, he saw a heavily made-up face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman, wearing revealing clothes and bold makeup, it was evident what she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step aside," Roger said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the other person didn't move away. Instead, they took a step closer to Roger and said, "Hey, why push people away when we've just met? Since we've bumped into each other, let me take you to a nice place and have some fun! By then, you won't have any worries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the woman spoke, she put on a seductive smile and used her finger to gesture towards Roger's chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger simply tilted his head back slightly, avoiding her finger altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go away and stop bothering me!" Roger impatiently exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expression on the woman's face immediately changed. "What's the matter? Do you look down on me? Who exactly do you think you are? Walking alone on the street at this late hour, you must be troubled by relationship problems. Most likely, you've been dumped by a woman. Look at you, you're just no good. Otherwise, why would someone dump you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other person continued to curse and complain, but these words were like invisible needles, constantly pricking at Roger's nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Troubled by relationship problems?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Him? How could that be?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly be troubled by relationship problems? He no longer had any feelings for Jasper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Roger shouted angrily, "Get lost, or don't blame me for laying a hand on women!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold voice and the sinister expression startled the woman, sending a chill down her spine. "Who do you think you are? Let me tell you, I... I'm not someone to be messed with..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the woman was saying these words, she kept moving back and quickly ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger slowly lifted his feet and walked to the side, sitting down on the edge of the roadside steps. He absentmindedly scratched his hair, looking somewhat dejected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's gotten into him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He set up a trap, and then forced William and Jasper into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, what he wanted to see was just when William was in deep trouble, Jasper would abandon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like back then, when the Abbott family was in chaos due to his mother's gambling, the Reed family also abandoned them, and Jasper, at that time, severed ties with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to see William end up in a similar situation as him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to prove that Jasper was indeed a self-preserving person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe only by doing this, can he make his desire for revenge even stronger and make him feel that it is not wrong for him to want to retaliate against her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, things did not unfold as he had hoped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't abandon William! She chose to stand by his side and fight alongside him.</span></p></div>
