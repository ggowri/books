        <h1>Chapter 1061</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She trembled. 'Is he... really going to keep me here until&hellip; I fall in love with him again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you gone mad? You&rsquo;re simply unlawfully detaining me!" exclaimed Grace as if it was the only way to ease the fear in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have I gone mad?" he muttered. His cold kiss ran down her earlobes, lingering on her cheeks and between her eyebrows. &ldquo;Perhaps I have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had probably gone mad when he fell for her and let her control his joy and sorrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You made me realize that jealousy can be so intense that I would want to destroy the world..." he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His soft voice created an ambiguous atmosphere in the dim room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not push Jason away. His kisses kept falling on her face, and his fingers were trying to rip the gown off her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" she cried out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't like you wearing clothes given by other men," he said coldly. Especially when the gown she was wearing was intended for the one Brian... &lsquo;missed the most&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not even know that Grace was the girl who saved his life when he was a child, but he gave Grace the gown anyway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does this mean? Are they meant to be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'They're still attracted to each other even if they have no idea of the truth. They&rsquo;ve been separated for a while, but... are they destined to end up together regardless of it all?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I, then? I fell for Grace first!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You said you don't love me anymore, didn't you?" He tore off her gown and ran his fingers over the place where her heart was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not see his expression in the dim room, but she could feel his intense stare on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What can I do to make you fall in love with me again?" he asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said nothing, and he sprinkled more kisses on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't fall in love with Brian, okay? The only person you can love is me..." It sounded like a command as well as a plea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart quivered a little. "Jason, I won't fall in love with you again." He already crushed all the love she had for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He muttered, "You won't? We have so much time left. One day, you'll fall in love with me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You won't let me go until I fall in love with you?" She began to gasp. It was as if he was trying to seduce her with all his might in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes..." he answered gently as if they were a couple in love. However, they were not a couple! "Do you want me?" His voice rang in her ears again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her sight was obstructed in the dim room, so her hearing became more acute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was seductive as if he was deliberately seducing her, luring her into everything he had carefully set up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body seemed to be under his control, and she could not help being attracted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was still sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she heard her own voice saying, "Jason, I don't want you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air seemed to fall into a dead silence almost instantly.</p></div>
