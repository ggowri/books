        <h1>Chapter 1948</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Only for a month?" Mrs. Sweeney could not help but worry. The time was too short. Could Hadwin Stephenson be convinced to get back together with her daughter in such a short time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina smiled gently. "If he still has feelings for me, one month is enough time. If he has no feelings for me, then even a year is useless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney sighed, "Okay, we'll stay out of what's going on between you and him. Whether you leave or stay, we'll be with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney also nodded, agreeing with his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina gripped the phone in her hands a little tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin and her would have something worked out in a month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the prison meeting room, Jason looked at Secretary Wang. "You altered my memory when you had someone hypnotize me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Secretary Wang smiled. "It seems you've found out about it, Young Master."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you do all these unnecessary things for Old master Reed and the Reed family?" Jason's voice was tinged with a chill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Of course," Secretary Wang said with no sense of guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said coldly, "For Old master Reed and the Reed family? It's just your arrogance and the twisted pleasure you get from controlling other people's lives. It all ends here. You&rsquo;ll stay in this prison forever. No matter how good you behave, you&rsquo;ll never get your sentence reduced. Grace and I will lead a good life together. Grace will forever be the only mistress of the Reed family and my wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Secretary Wang's expression changed a little before suddenly saying, "Young master Reed, you&rsquo;ve always been skeptical. Do you really believe in Grace? Do you believe that it didn't bother her when you did nothing and let her go to prison for three years? Maybe she'll betray you one day anyway. After all, never twice without three times, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Secretary Wang seemed to want to sow seeds of doubt into Jason's mind, and every word would provoke Jason's suspicion of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he was let down in the end because Jason's expression did not change. He just looked at him coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is that all you got? If I can't trust the woman who loves me the most in the world, who else can I trust? No matter what happens to her and me, I trust her and will never doubt her love for me,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After recovering all his memories, he finally understood how much she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had always thought that she loved the children more and that the children were the main reason she stayed with him, but he suddenly recalled that she had once given up on herself and the children for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was the one she sacrificed everything to save.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How could he not believe in such a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I won't come here to see you anymore." Jason got up. "But you should still be able to read the news in prison. Then maybe you'll see that having a weakness isn't all bad. Only when you have weaknesses can you be human!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was Grace who made him realize what it meant to be alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His weakness was Grace, and it would be the same for the rest of his life!</p></div>
