        <h1>Chapter 774</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No... It's not exactly blank. On the last page, there&rsquo;s just a photo. A photo of me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a photo of her in a floral dress that he used to think looked good and got it for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To her surprise, the photo was kept in his photo album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she found a small silver bracelet at the place where the photo album had been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so focused on the photo album that she neglected the bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This bracelet&hellip;' Grace's chest tightened suddenly. 'I recall this being the bracelet Brian carried with him everywhere. Why is it with Jay?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, this bracelet... is Brian's!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly picked up the small silver bracelet. This one was just the same style and size as that one, but it was much more oxidized than that bracelet. The surface was a little darker, unlike that bracelet. Brian probably carried it around with him and often rubbed his fingers against it, so it was brighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Then this bracelet&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly thought of the jewelry box that her grandmother had left her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I didn't find the little bracelet that was supposed to be part of the pair. However, what if... this is the bracelet?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why... is it in Jay's room?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly felt uneasy. It was as if something she did not know had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Only Jason can solve this mystery for her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Holding the small silver bracelet in her hand, Grace left the room and went downstairs. She had just reached the ground floor when she heard a commotion outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace rushed forward and only saw a woman who seemed to be desperately trying to break in but was being blocked by several servants. Jason and Terrence were standing before the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed, sorry. I didn't expect her to burst into here. I'll take care of her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman who was being stopped by the servants... Grace now recognized her! It was... Dr. Leng! Dr. Leng, the one who was supposed to give her the hypnosis treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Leng happened to be heading in Grace's direction right now. She immediately shouted at the sight of Grace, "Miss Cummins, tell Mr. Reed that I didn't hypnotize you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze instantly and felt as if something had exploded in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Hypnosis? Jay?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why does Dr. Leng want me to tell Jason this? Does Jason know Dr. Leng? I've never said anything about hypnosis to Jay! All I've ever said... was a headache!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The riddle was increasing one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the figure not far away. He turned around slowly as his handsome face looked at her gently with his usual smile. He said, "You're up? I'll get the servants to serve your breakfast. Let&rsquo;s get something to eat first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he moved forward and touched the hair beside her cheeks gently. He then ordered Terrence who was behind him, "Take care of this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Terrence answered immediately as he trembled. He hurriedly got someone to bring Dr. Leng out of Reed Residence.</p></div>
