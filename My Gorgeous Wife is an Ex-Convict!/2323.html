        <h1>Chapter 2321</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you had enough? Kyla, I felt nothing even when you kissed me like that," Martin Weiss said coldly before walking away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's mouth was full of bitterness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had always told him that it was enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he was telling her the same thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that feelings that used to be so deep could be erased so easily. They remembered their past, but... he no longer had feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was not that he loved too much and she loved too little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead... her feelings were beginning to deepen, but his... were already gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Grace stared at Jason with widened eyes and a face full of shock. She could hardly believe what she had just heard. "Did you say Martin Weiss went to the hypnotist who hypnotized you... for hypnosis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Jason nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... did he do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If my guess is correct, he probably underwent hypnosis to forget about his feelings for Kyla. After all, the pain must&rsquo;ve been too much for him after Kyla rejected him like that," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Kyla has rejected him before. He... should be able to take it," mumbled Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason laughed. "This is different. If Kyla had always rejected Martin Weiss without giving him any hope, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal if she did it again. However, Kyla showed Martin Weiss her worry and concern after he saved her. She even stayed by Martin Weiss's side every day. She gave Martin Weiss hope." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he put his arm around Grace and muttered, "If you push someone into a pit of despair after giving them hope, the despair would not only disappoint them but also devastate them so much that they would rather die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed to strike a chord in Grace's heart. "You were devastated too, weren't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she had spoken briefly without elaborating it, he knew she was talking about what had happened to him after she fell off the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I was devastated too, and... I was pretty much out of my mind at the time. But my hypnosis was a passive choice, while Martin Weiss made the decision himself," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She fell off the cliff to keep him alive, but she left him with all the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a good thing you didn't lose your mind..." she murmured and hugged him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if I did, I'm sure I would&rsquo;ve come to my senses when I saw you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, how did Martin Weiss find the hypnotist? Did he..." Grace thought of a possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's answer confirmed her speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He visited Secretary Wang in prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does that mean he doesn't have any feelings for Kyla anymore after getting hypnotized?" She thought that he was in a hypnotic state. Even though he vaguely remembered the things that had happened between them, he had no feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think so," said Jason.</p></div>
