        <h1>Chapter 2320</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know about Jason losing his memory when Grace fell off a cliff, don't you? Jason didn't really have amnesia. His memory was only partially locked away. The hypnotist used hypnosis to play down Jason's feelings for Grace. In other words, he remembered what had happened between them, but he just felt like a spectator watching a movie. He didn&rsquo;t resonate with it.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, her heart sank. An instinctive sense of uneasiness rose in her chest as if she was afraid of what he might say next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said darkly, "What's the matter? You&rsquo;ve figured it out, haven&rsquo;t you? Yes, I found that hypnotist and made him suppress my feelings for you. Hence, I don't have any love or hatred for you anymore. You're just a somewhat familiar stranger to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart instantly felt as if it had been hit hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Familiar... stranger?" she murmured, her eyes watering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I remember our memories together, but it&rsquo;s just like watching a movie," he said as his fingertips ran across the wet outer corners of her eyes. "Kyla, you said it's for the best that we have nothing to do with each other in the future. I'm going to tell you the same thing too. I'll take care of our children but I won&rsquo;t do anything more than that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he withdrew his hand, casually took a tissue on the coffee table, and wiped his fingers that had touched her cheek. He said, "Now, I've already told you this. You didn't want me to trouble you, so you'd better not trouble me too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he was about to leave, Kyla suddenly exclaimed, "Wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Is there something else?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it true that our past is... just like a movie to you?&rdquo; she asked in a murmur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it's just like watching a movie. I don't feel much when the movie is over," he said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him as she suddenly walked up to him. She put her hands around his neck, stood on her tiptoes, and kissed him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if to verify his words, she kissed him forcefully and actively, which she would not normally have done. However, today...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she unwilling to believe it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she unwilling to believe that he had gotten over their relationship in such a short time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no matter how she kissed him, his lips were always so cold and without response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When this kiss finally ended, Kyla stared blankly at the face right in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was indifferent and cold. There was no emotion in his dark eyes. Even though her figure was reflected in his dark eyes, it seemed so strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This man... doesn't love me anymore, completely and utterly!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The realization flashed through her mind.</p></div>
