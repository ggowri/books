        <h1>Chapter 1025</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm&hellip; fine." Lina was still shocked at her boyfriend's sudden arrival. "How did you know I was here?" She did not remember telling him the exact address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How dare you ask me that?" he asked. She had started screaming in the middle of the call and there were men's snappy voices in the background too, so he panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had hung up. He called her again, but he could not get through to her. He was so anxious that he broke out in a cold sweat. He could only follow the words &lsquo;Huaihai Road&rsquo; she mentioned earlier and drove over to look for her on the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The 20-minute journey was shortened to 10 minutes. He had no idea how many speeding tickets he was going to get later!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The next time you're in danger, at least tell me where you are before you hang up! Do you have any idea how panicked I was?" Hadwin Stephenson half-growled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. She looked at the man's pale face and the cold sweat on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could see that he was worried about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; I'm sorry!" Lina said sheepishly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glared at her as she apologized like a schoolgirl. Her apology extinguished all his anxiety, impatience, and restlessness like a fire extinguisher!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not get mad at her even if he wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gave a long sigh and took her in his arms. "Don't make me worry so much again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This embrace is so warm!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could not help but hug Hadwin Stephenson back as she answered, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, even though she was sorry, she felt warm inside and was overjoyed&hellip; He cared about her so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two held each other for a long time before Lina realized she and Hadwin Stephenson were about to become the focus of onlookers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, her usual thick face turned red. She said to Kyla Corbyn, "Well... Kyla, you should get back to running your business. Grace and I will take these three thugs to the police station."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry to trouble you," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright." Lina waved her hand repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, they decided that the two bodyguards would share a car with the three men while Lina and Grace would sit in Hadwin Stephenson's car. Then, the two cars headed for the police station that oversaw this stretch of road.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked on as the car moved away. She thought of how Hadwin Stephenson was so worried about Lina earlier and could not help feeling envious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Isn't this the kind of relationship I once hoped for? I thought I had it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'In the end, it was all just wishful thinking. The man didn't love nor pity me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Otherwise, he wouldn't be so cruel to me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's eyes darkened as she thought of the custody case. She knew that the road ahead would be difficult for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she would go on no matter how hard it was!</p></div>
