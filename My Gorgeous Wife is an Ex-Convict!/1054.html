        <h1>Chapter 1053</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace knew her best friend. No matter how much of a fangirl Lina was, she only appreciated the celebrities she fangirled over. Hadwin Stephenson was probably the only one Lina loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson probably loved Lina a lot and that was why he was tolerant enough to accompany Lina here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was happy for her best friend. Lina was lucky to have met such a tolerant boyfriend, and she wished Lina could stay happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Lina finished chatting with the popular celebrity, Grace came up to her and said, "I'm leaving, so I came to bid you goodbye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're leaving? Why won't you stay longer? It's rare to see so many celebrities," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You go ahead. You know I'm not that crazy about, uh, celebrities," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina thought so too, so she did not ask her best friend to stay. She only said, "Have you seen Paisley Daniels and Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I've talked to them. We'll have to see if Kyla encounters any more problems after this," said Grace. Then, she whispered in her best friend's ear, "You should take care of your boyfriend's feelings even if you&rsquo;re only fangirling."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Calm down. My Hadwin is generous," Lina said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Generous?' Grace pitied the &lsquo;generous&rsquo; Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I gotta go," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She made her way to the exit. 'Brian must be with Stella now. I might as well see him tomorrow to thank him and return the gown.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was deep in thought, someone suddenly grabbed her arm. She turned her head and immediately caught sight of Brian's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're leaving?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I've finished what I came to do today. Thank you." Grace thanked him again. "I'll return the gown I'm wearing to your office tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't need to return the gown. Consider it a gift," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's too expensive. I can't accept it," said Grace. With its workmanship and the inlaid pieces, she estimated the gown to cost at least several million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've worn it. Who do you want me to give it to? Or do you think any woman would want to accept a gown that has already been worn by someone else as a gift?" said Brian as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you return it to me, I'll just throw it away," said Brian. However, he just wanted her to keep the gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because... she had given him a wonderful fantasy just by wearing the gown and it made him feel as if his fantasy came true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll send you home if that's where you're heading," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you have to&hellip; accompany someone else?" Grace pointed out. After all, Stella seemed eager to have Brian accompany her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I just want to accompany you," said Brian as he stared at the woman in front of him. "Stella is indeed the little girl I&rsquo;ve been looking for and the one who saved my life, but the one I love is you! Grace, I hope you never get that wrong."</p></div>
