        <h1>Chapter 2854</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although her uncle still had some affection for her, it did not mean much in the face of her aunt's repeated demands. Eventually, she had a falling out with her uncle's family, and she stopped telling her uncle what was on her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her aunt and cousin often asked her for money. Why did her uncle call her this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would find out tonight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt a dull pain in her heart when she thought of the happy times she spent with her uncle when she was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How wonderful it would be if everything were as it was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller went to her uncle's home that night. Her uncle's family of three had been waiting for her. Meanwhile, there were black and white photos of her parents, incense, candles, and some food on the living room table. It looked as if they had done a ritual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, today was not her parents' death anniversary, nor was it a special day such as Tomb Sweeping Day and winter solstice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is..." Valda Theller stared in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ferris stepped forward and said awkwardly, "We haven&rsquo;t paid respects to your parents in a long time, so I thought we might as well do it today since you were coming back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the face similar to her father's. Her father looked like her uncle, so Valda Theller often stared at her uncle in a daze after her father's death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, come and pay respects to your parents." Her aunt, Rowena Santiago, also said passionately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her cousin, Wynne, said, "Valda, we've all paid our respects. You're the only one left. You're the most filial to your parents. You won't reject paying your respects, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to be hinting at something else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago said to her son, "What are you saying? Valda is so filial to her parents. How could she not pay her respects?" She handed the incense sticks to Valda Theller as she spoke with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at the incense sticks and took them a moment later. She lit the incense sticks and bowed respectfully to her parents' photo three times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would soon find out what her uncle's family was up to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the incense sticks and the candles were almost lit, her uncle and the rest put away the incense sticks, candles, and offerings before serving food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ferris grabbed Valda Theller and said, "Come and eat. Valda, you finally came back today. Have dinner with me. Valda, you have a boyfriend now. I'm happy to know your boyfriend is the crown prince of the entertainment industry. Your parents would smile from ear to ear if they knew you found such a good boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's eyelids twitched slightly as she vaguely had a bad feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here, tell me how you're doing with the crown prince. Did he say he would marry you?" Ferris asked with fake concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We've only been dating for a short time. We're not ready to talk about marriage yet," Valda Theller said indifferently.</p></div>
