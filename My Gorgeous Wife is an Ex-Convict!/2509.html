        <h1>Chapter 2507</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you finally came to see me. I thought my husband was going to leave me here to die," Louise Mitchell said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Simon is sick and needs a blood transfusion. He underwent a transfusion with the same blood type from the blood bank, but it didn't work out so well. The doctor said it&rsquo;ll be better for his biological parents to provide the blood," said George Gregory with intense fatigue in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon suddenly fell ill. Simon had type-B blood, while he had type-A blood. There was no way he could donate his blood to Simon. The only possibility was to have Louise Mitchell donate her blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Louise Mitchell replied, "What's the matter? You only came looking for me because you want my blood? Would you never have come if this hadn't happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory did not answer but looked at her indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell suddenly sneered. "George Gregory, that's enough. Don't you want something from me? Won't you even tell me a lie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're Simon's mother," he only spoke indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was reminding her of her status as a mother and telling her that she had to donate blood to treat the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would save Simon if he were her child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Simon was Amber Mitchell's child! She was stuck in the detention center because of Amber Mitchell. She was reluctant to use her blood to save Amber Mitchell's child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll file a request for temporary Stephensonl so that you can go to Simon's hospital and donate blood to him. We can't delay his treatment. The longer we delay it, the more dangerous it&rsquo;ll be for him," George Gregory said as he got up to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was only informing Louise Mitchell. She did not even need to make the decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can donate blood to Simon, but I won't do it if I'm not acquitted!" Louise Mitchell said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory paused and looked at Louise Mitchell in disbelief. "You're going to kill him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell sarcastically countered, "Why aren&rsquo;t you saying that you're killing me? George Gregory, you stood by and refused to help the Mitchell family. Why didn't you think about what would happen to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're Simon's mother!" He reminded again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you're my husband, aren't you? The kid will blame you if he ever pursues the matter. You neglected me first, so it's not your place to accuse me of neglecting the child!" Louise Mitchell snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at George Gregory's ghastly expression, she suddenly felt a sense of pleasure after getting revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory did not care about her, but he cared about his only son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he would never know that Amber Mitchell was the mother of his son. The child was now seriously ill. It seemed that George Gregory would get her out no matter what for the sake of the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell probably did not expect her own son to be the one to save Louise Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The wind at night was cold. Amber Mitchell came out of the Moss family&rsquo;s house. She had gotten the information she wanted from the Moss family and made up her mind.</p></div>
