        <h1>Chapter 868</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the most important thing for her was to compare the details Chase Harper told her today with the materials at hand to find out more clues that could confirm her speculation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, the black car had arrived at Reed Residence, but Jason did not step down. Instead, he continued leaning on the back seat with his eyes closed while the video was playing on the phone beside his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The video showed scenes of Grace with Chase Harper and Nelson in the amusement park today, but it was not the same video Grace saw earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were many more such videos on Jason's phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These videos captured almost everything Grace experienced at the amusement park today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, who was sitting in the front row, dared not breathe loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The video sounded cheerful, but the atmosphere inside the car was extremely depressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed, we're here," said Terrence after a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Jason replied absent-mindedly. Listening to the video was torture for him, but he still kept listening to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He listened to video after video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after breaking up and deciding not to love her anymore, he could not stand it when she was with another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching her smile at another man made him extremely jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He ruled Emerald City and controlled the fate of countless people, but now, he did not even know how to suppress this jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don't want her to like other men!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If she goes back to being my sis, will I be able to keep her by my side?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father's voice rang in his ear again, &lsquo;Jay, don't love someone too much. If you love someone too much, they&rsquo;ll control your life and death. If she doesn't love you, you may even feel that your existence is meaningless!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If one day she gets over me and falls in love with someone else, even if I could control my own life and death, would it... really matter?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can I really stop loving her after the breakup?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If so, why... am I so jealous?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm so jealous my heart is aching!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day in the law firm, Grace talked to Lawyer Carter about the clue Chase Harper provided yesterday as well as her speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You mean it could have been someone else?" Lawyer Carter did not expect Grace to come up with such a hypothesis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. When the accident happened, there were two people in the perpetrator's car&mdash;the actress Elise Dean and her assistant Pansy Dittman. The police investigation was based on the testimony of the people involved. Pansy Dittman was the driver, and Elise Dean didn't drive because she had drunk a little alcohol at a party that night," said Grace.</p></div>
