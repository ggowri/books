        <h1>Chapter 1436</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly smiled, but it was as if he were crying. "Jason... Do you know how envious I am of you? You can be with... Grace, but Kyla and I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's drunken gaze moved away from Jason's face. It took him a long time to finally focus his eyes on Grace's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, you... You're Kyla's friend, so tell me what&hellip; What do I have to do to make her... take my liver and have... the operation..." His voice grew hoarser as he spoke, and he was breathing unsteadily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. "What happened? You told Kyla about the liver donation and Kyla refused to accept it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly broke out into a bitter smile as his eyes reddened. "Yes, she refused to accept it. She... She doesn't want anything from me in her body... She would rather die than have my liver!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But I want her to live! I want to see her alive and well in this world. Whether she forgives me or not, I want her alive!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's face suddenly became grave. A liver transplant was now Kyla's only chance of survival. Martin Weiss was willing to donate his liver, but she did not expect Kyla to reject it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, tell me. Tell... Tell me... what... What to do... If half a liver isn't enough, I... I can give her my whole liver. All of it..." Martin Weiss still stubbornly wanted an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the way Martin Weiss was, Grace only felt angry and sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss, you shouldn't have let things go so far if you knew it'd end like this! If you hadn't hurt Kyla again and again, Kyla wouldn't be so resolute now!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, it's all my fault! Haha... Why did I let things go so far if I knew it'd end like this?" Martin Weiss sobbed, and he beat his heart with his fist. "She said she doesn't want to see me whether she's alive or dead. She hates me... She hates me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Tears welled up in Martin Weiss's eyes, only to come streaming down his face in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss was no longer that proud and conceited man. It was as if he were an abandoned child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He cried louder and louder. "Is she... not going to give me a second glance even if I die in front of her... But I love her. I love her..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if Martin Weiss was going to vent all the feelings in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was sobbing and his voice was hoarse. He looked entirely like a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss, it would&rsquo;ve been nice if you had been a little lenient on Kyla. Unfortunately, some damage is permanent once it&rsquo;s caused. No matter how much you love Kyla now, it may already be too late for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's voice rang out in the air, while Jason, who was standing next to her, suddenly shuddered. He watched her profile in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, Jason's heart was filled with a touch of panic. His body shuddered slightly, and his eyes fell on Martin Weiss who was sobbing and immersed in endless regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, he seemed to see his future in Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No! I won't turn out like Martin Weiss!' Jason refused to accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason told the maids to handle Martin Weiss. Then, he went back to the bedroom with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's with Martin Weiss? He was so ruthless to Kyla and now he's crying so hard. If tears could solve problems, then everyone can just cry whenever they do something wrong. How could there be such an easy way out?" mumbled Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was angry with what Martin Weiss had done. If he loved Kyla, why would he hurt her like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What was the use even if Martin Weiss cried so much now?</p></div>
