        <h1>Chapter 1884</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She stared at his face as it magnified before her eyes. Then, his lips brushed her cheek and stopped at her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She heard his voice say, "Grace, I won't forgive you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her blood froze as if she was in an ice cellar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at her best friend's haggard look and could not help asking, "What's wrong? Did something happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I did something that hurt Jay," Grace said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you quarrel with Jason?" Lina asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Quarrel?' Grace smiled wryly. It would have been better if they had just quarreled. She did not even know where Jay was right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He left Reed Residence and had not returned after saying that he would not forgive her in the mourning hall that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She went to his office, mansion, and even the street where his father died, but she could not find him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she asked Terrence, he only said, "Young master Reed wants some time to calm down and doesn't want to be disturbed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence refused to say anything more when she asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I was too full of myself. I thought he would forgive me because he loves me. But I&rsquo;ll try to find a way to make up with him. Don't worry," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was afraid her best friend would be worried about her. After all, Lina's top priority now was to rest. "By the way, how's the baby doing?" asked Grace as she changed the topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A smile finally appeared on Lina's face once Grace mentioned the baby in her belly. "The doctor told me the baby's doing well today. Our heart rates are back to normal, and the drug is probably out of my system now. There's no trace of that drug in the blood test. They'll arrange an ultrasound to check on the baby later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's good." Finally, there was good news amid the bad news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I didn't expect Katherine Jackson to hurt me!" Lina felt a lingering fear. Her best friend told her that she was admitted to the hospital because Katherine Jackson had bribed someone in the community health center to add something else into the progesterone shot she was taking, causing her abnormal heart rate that even endangered the baby in her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She thought she would have no conflict with Katherine Jackson after she broke up with Hadwin Stephenson, but who knew Katherine Jackson never planned to let her go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I've given the information to the police. They're already looking for Katherine Jackson!" said Grace. They just did not have enough evidence so far, hence the police were just looking for her. They could not issue an arrest warrant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I wonder when they'll catch Katherine Jackson," muttered Lina. She would not feel at ease as long as Katherine Jackson was not captured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'And Hadwin Stephenson... Does he know what Katherine Jackson has done? Does he know that the person he's sleeping with wants the baby and me dead? Or does he already know everything? Maybe he's hiding Katherine Jackson so that the police can't find her?'</p></div>
