        <h1>Chapter 2965</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing the art exhibition, the five of them went to the restaurant in the amusement park to have an afternoon tea together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two men took Nelson to get some food while Kyla and Valda sat at the table waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you and Brian really together now?" Kyla hesitated and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mhmm," Valda nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you mind about Grace's matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If someone says they don't mind at all, that's not true, but I understand that there's nothing wrong with loving someone. Grace is not wrong, and neither is Brian," Valda said, looking up and her gaze fell on Brian who was holding his meal not far away. "I love Brian, and although his feelings for me are only like at the moment, I think maybe someday he will fall in love with me too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Kyla doesn't want to rain on Valda's parade, she's afraid that this woman in front of her might suffer even greater harm in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, on the day Grace gave birth, she was also at the hospital. She heard what Brian said at the time and saw Valda's reaction when she heard those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian still has feelings for Grace in his heart, and although Valda is a good woman, Kyla naturally doesn't want to see Valda show the same expression as before on some future day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if that day never happened?" Kyla asked. "Do you really think he would have fallen in love with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At least he and I are both working towards this goal," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Valda, feelings can't just be forced to bloom through effort alone! If it were that easy to make someone fall in love with another person just by trying hard, then there wouldn't be so many unrequited loves in this world," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know that not everything can be achieved just by working hard, but if you don't try, you won't get any results," Valda said with a slight smile to Kyla. "Kyla, I am fully aware of what I am doing and the risks and consequences involved. However, I still want to give it a try. I am betting that man will fall in love with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Valda's smiling face with a sense of bewilderment. It was a smile full of hope for the future, a smile that believed in eventually finding happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, she seemed to see her former self, who used to always wear such a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But there was a time when this kind of smile no longer appeared on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda is brave, at least she knows what she wants and works hard to achieve it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So I wish you success!" said Kyla, all she could offer now was her blessing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A moment later, Brian, Martin, and Nelson returned with their meals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Five people sat around the table and began to enjoy their afternoon tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda took a sip of coffee but frowned, "It's so bitter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not added the cream and sugar yet," said Brian, as he picked up the creamer and yellow sugar from the side and poured them into the coffee cup in front of Valda. He then used a small spoon to gently stir it for a moment before lifting the coffee cup to Valda's lips. "Try it now, is it still bitter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda took a small sip and said, "It's still a bit bitter." But it's much better than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So Brian poured some more brown sugar and held up his coffee cup for Valda to taste again, saying "How about now?"</p></div>
