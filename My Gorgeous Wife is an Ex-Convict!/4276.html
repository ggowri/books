        <h1>Chapter 4274 If you love someone, you will understand</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lornell, I never realized before that you are this kind of person," Lornell said. "I always felt that you were the one in control in your relationship with Tina, but now it seems like Tina is the one in control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler didn't say anything, he just lowered his head and looked at his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his middle finger, he used to wear their wedding ring even when she was missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ever since he signed that divorce agreement, he took off the wedding ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in that moment of </span><span>taking</span><span> it off, it felt like something was being stripped away from him, painfully so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even if you ask the Quentin family to help you extract the curse, even my grandfather doesn't have a hundred percent certainty," Lornell continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own grandfather went to the Quentin family himself. He also heard from Lornell that the two grandfathers had a long discussion in a secret room and finally came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's grandfather agreed to personally extract the curse from his body, but the price was that the Hunter family had to leave behind all the records of the curses and the worms in the Quentin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that the Quentin family would know the secrets that originally belonged to the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the extraction fails, the backlash you will suffer will be severe. Even if the Quentin family can save your life, it may cause irreversible damage to your body," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning about the Hunter family's curse, he was shocked for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, such things seemed too vague and unreal in modern times, like a story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this story just happened to exist, and it happened to the person he had known since childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know," Chandler said with a faint smile. "Since I've decided to ask your grandfather to help me extract the curse, I'm mentally prepared for the worst outcome. </span><span>However</span><span>..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it fails and my body suffers severe damage, I hope that the Quentin family can keep it a secret and not tell the outside world the reasons behind my injuries, especially Tina."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really care about her. Even though you're the one suffering for her, why don't you just have a child together? It would have been so simple," Lornell mocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A child shouldn't be born for such reasons. A child is not a tool," Chandler said. "Besides, Tina doesn't owe me anything. It has always been me who has gained more from Tina."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't understand why you can do this for Tina to such an extent," Lornell said, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you love Harley?" Chandler suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Lornell was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you truly love Harley, then you would understand why I went to such lengths," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell frowned, "I don't need to love Harley, I just need to fulfill my duties as a fianc&eacute;. Besides, if I'm destined to get married and have children to continue the family line, then I'll just find someone who I find pleasing to look at."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Harley just someone you find pleasing to look at?" Chandler questioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else?" Lornell retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it was you who specifically asked her to be your fianc&eacute;e," Chandler reminded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, I just wanted to know what it feels like to have a fianc&eacute;e, and she happened to need the Quentin family to save her life. So, it was a fair exchange of conditions," Lornell admitted openly.</span></p></div>
