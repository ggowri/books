        <h1>Chapter 2870</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From what he remembered, the last few times Brian got drunk were related to Grace. Could this have something to do with Grace too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Brian tried to drink another bottle, Patrick rushed to stop him and said, "That's enough! No more drinks!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Patrick in a drunken daze. "What... What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick said, "Your secretary sent me here to see what's going on with you. I heard from your secretary that you&rsquo;ve been shutting yourself in the mansion all day today. Don't tell me you've been drinking all day!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've been... drinking..." Brian replied drunkenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did Grace say this time triggered you to drink?" Patrick snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not... It's not Grace," murmured Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not?" Patrick looked shocked. He did not expect his best friend to be drunk not because of Grace. Who else could make Brian get so drunk?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick suddenly thought of Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you get drunk because of Valda Theller?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression instantly changed when he heard the name, and a miserable yet subdued growl came from his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, what's come over you?" Patrick was shocked to learn that Valda Theller was the reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did she want to break up? She said she loved me!" Brian grabbed a bottle and drank from the mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. Stop drinking. You&rsquo;ll have to go to the hospital if you continue drinking!" Patrick grabbed the bottle from his best friend and asked, "You broke up with Valda Theller?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, we broke up..." Brian said with a smile, but his drunken face seemed tinged with intense agony. "Patrick, I know I was wrong today..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said and leaned his head on Patrick's shoulder as if exhausted. &ldquo;I know... I shouldn't have left when she was mobbed and gone to the hospital. I shouldn't have left her... for Grace, but... But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sobbed, unable to go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick had no idea what was happening, but he could get a grip of what was going on from his best friend's stammers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why won't she give me a little more time... With a little more time..." Maybe he would have fallen in love with her! His feelings for her would have been more than just like!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You leaving Valda Theller for Grace just shows you don't love Valda Theller enough," Patrick said with a sigh. He thought Valda Theller could save his best friend from the mess. It seemed he had overestimated that woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't love her enough?" Brian suddenly smiled sadly. "Yeah, I don't love her enough... I don't love her enough..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let me help you to your bedroom," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly pushed him away, "I want to drink... more..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick looked at his best friend helplessly. "Why are you drinking so much for her if you don't love her enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, why... Why..." Brian murmured but still refused to put down his glass. "She said she doesn&rsquo;t want to become evil... because of her jealousy. She said she&rsquo;d want more and more... She&rsquo;d become greedier because she loves me, so... she wanted to break up with me...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can give her anything she wants... as long as... as long as she&rsquo;ll give me a little more time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller... Valda... Don't break up with me, okay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick became emotional as he listened to his best friend's drunken stammers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was considered capable for making Brian this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Any ordinary person would desperately try to hold on to Brian if they could attract him and become his girlfriend, yet this woman dumped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick hesitated slightly before picking up Brian's phone on the coffee table. Then, he grabbed Brian's hand, unlocked it with his fingerprint, found Valda Theller's phone number from his contacts list, and dialed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ringing for a long time, someone finally answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello? Is this Valda Theller?" Patrick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, who are you?" Valda Theller asked after pausing slightly. Brian's number was shown on her phone screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Patrick. If you're available, can you come to Brian's mansion? He's been drinking all day. I can't talk him out of it. I hope you can persuade him," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated. "But we..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you broke up, and Brian is probably drunk because of you. Why don't you come and talk it out with him if there's anything you haven't said?" Patrick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was silent. They had made it very clear between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she felt a pang in her heart when she heard that he had been drinking all day because of their breakup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, she said, "Alright, I'll stop by."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll send someone to get you," Patrick said with a sigh of relief. He was afraid Valda Theller would refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks, I'll take a taxi there. I know the address," Valda Theller said and ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick looked at Brian who was still drinking non-stop. Maybe the only one who could convince him now was Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, he called Valda Theller over now with another agenda. Maybe Valda Theller would take back her decision to break up with Brian when she saw the way he looked right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, women were soft-hearted, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Valda Theller reached Brian's mansion, Patrick hurriedly handed the responsibility of taking care of Brian to Valda Theller. "Please talk to him. He'll get alcohol poisoning if he keeps drinking like this. I have something to do, so I gotta go now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without waiting for Valda Theller to reply, he left the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and Brian were the only two left in the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller walked up to Brian, who was half-lying on the coffee table with a half-drunk bottle of wine in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smell of alcohol rushed to her nose as soon as she got close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She glanced at the empty bottles around the coffee table. &lsquo;Did he drink all this wine?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian," she called his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body seemed to move slightly. Then, he slowly raised his head and looked in her direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pair of dark phoenix eyes seemed to be out of focus and intoxicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised the bottle and threw his head back as if to drink from it.</p></div>
