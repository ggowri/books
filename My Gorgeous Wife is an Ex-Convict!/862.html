        <h1>Chapter 861</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he was nice to her, but... it always made her feel like something was missing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">More importantly, after Kyla was imprisoned, she thought it would not be long before he married her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, their wedding kept getting delayed, and this made her worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels bit her lip slightly and looked at the man in front of her as she asked, "If I want to marry you, would you... be willing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to delay it any longer. After knowing that he had found Kyla in Emerald City, she was even more worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He probably extended his stay in Emerald City by a few more days for Kyla!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But he somehow came back early! Moreover, he&rsquo;s always talking about getting even with Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What was going on now? Didn't he find Kyla? It doesn&rsquo;t seem like anything has happened, though.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after he came back, he never mentioned Kyla again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What happened to him and Kyla in Emerald City?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though Paisley Daniels was full of speculations, she dared not ask anyone to check. She was afraid that she might draw attention if she made a move and he would notice it. If that happened, she would only disgust him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss gave Paisley Daniels a thoughtful look, which immediately made Paisley Daniels feel like he was going to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She heard the word from Martin Weiss's mouth at last, and Paisley Daniels only felt a burst of ecstasy surging within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want to... marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't we announce the wedding date at your family's dinner party? I'll have someone check the dates later and you can pick one out," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he uttered the words, the image of Kyla stabbing a broken glass into her stomach appeared in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so resolute and fierce. Like a nightmare, that scene kept flashing through his mind when he was asleep at night! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop thinking about that woman! Paisley's the one I should cherish!' Martin Weiss said to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels looked even more delighted, but then she frowned again. "However... You know that it&rsquo;ll be difficult for me to... conceive and have a child, don&rsquo;t you? Martin, won't you loathe me for that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't be silly." Martin Weiss raised his hand and took Paisley Daniels into his arms. "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be standing here right now. Paisley, you saved my life, and I'll protect you and love you forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels leaned in Martin Weiss's arms, and there was a glimmer in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ll soon become the Weiss family's mistress while Kyla remains to be nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin will never know that the person who saved his life was actually Kyla&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the weekend, Grace got up very early to pick Nelson up for their trip to the amusement park. As soon as she opened the door, she saw Chase Harper standing outside the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "What are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I thought of some new clues that are related to the case, so... I wanted to talk to you about it." Then, Chase Harper hesitated and asked, "Do you... have a minute?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at his shy, cautious expression, Grace felt as though something was pressing her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had clearly rejected him that day.</p></div>
