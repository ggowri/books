        <h1>Chapter 3445</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Mason walked towards the teaching building, he overheard three girls talking. One of them said, "What? You just pushed Veronica? Aren't you afraid that Veronica and Mason will report you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you afraid of? Veronica is still flirting with other guys!" The girl who pushed Veronica sneered, seeming a bit disdainful. "I just gave her a light push, it didn't take much effort. She fell down on her own! Girls like Veronica, how can she even have the face to be Mason's sister? She doesn't even think about what kind of family background Mason has! I bet Mason will leave the Barlow family sooner or later, and then Veronica will just be an ugly duckling..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girl became more and more excited as she spoke, incessantly criticizing Veronica without noticing the changing expressions of her two female companions who kept exchanging glances with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, it was you who pushed me, Veronica."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girl suddenly snapped out of her thoughts when a voice sounded behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly turned around and saw her prince charming, Mason, standing behind her. "Mason? What are you doing here?" The girl stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason gave the girl a cold, icy stare and asked her without any expression, "Veronica, which hand did you use to push me? Or was it both hands?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the girl felt a chill run down her spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he was the prince charming she had always dreamed of, at this moment, she felt a sense of terror as if... this person was not someone she could covet or fantasize about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica returned to the classroom, Mason's backpack was missing, and only her backpack remained on the desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did Mason go back first? Veronica thought to herself, but in the past, this situation had never happened before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of Veronica's classmates saw her and said, "Veronica, I just saw Mason go back alone with his backpack. Why didn't you guys go back together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback, so did Mason really go back first?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took out her phone and dialed Mason's number. After a while, he finally answered and she heard his voice on the other end. "Veronica, what's up?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just wanted to ask, how did you manage to go back first?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I need to make a trip back to the Reed family today," said Mason in a calm tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Return to the Reed family?" Veronica paused for a moment. Today wasn't the day he was supposed to return to the Reed family. "Has something happened to your family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing happened. Veronica, don't you always hope that I can spend more time with my family? So now I am doing what you want, as Veronica wished. Is that not good?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is... that so? Alright then, you take care and spend some quality time with your family. See you tomorrow," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, see you tomorrow," Mason said and then ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at her phone that had just ended the call. During the conversation, Mason's voice sounded a bit strange, not like his usual self. Was it just her imagination?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Also, although she hoped that he could improve his relationship with his family, Mason's sudden return home without any warning made her feel uneasy.</p></div>
