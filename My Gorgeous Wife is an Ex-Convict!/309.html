        <h1>Chapter 308</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, if a man like him could get in danger, it did not matter whether she kneeled or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she were to break her legs kneeling, it would not do him any good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her silence darkened his eyes. Without another word, he started the car and drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace felt nothing but silence and repression in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to Lina the next day, and the two found a table at a restaurant near Lina's house. Looking at her best friend's obvious dark eye circles, Grace reckoned she did not sleep well last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened after you got home yesterday?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't go there. My parents were preparing a ransom and almost made me kneel on the washboard when I got home," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face was full of surprise. "Why? You didn't tell them about Hadwin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh, I told them that a friend I hadn't seen for a long time played a little joke on me, but I forgot to tell them. It was all a false alarm," Lina said. She did not have the guts to tell her parents the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If her parents knew that she had &lsquo;slept&rsquo; with a man abroad, they would have done more than just roast her last night. Maybe her old man would have beaten her with a rolling pin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it with you and Hadwin? Why did he take you away like that yesterday?" Grace asked the biggest question in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Also yesterday, after seeing Hadwin, she found out that this man was the same man she had seen through the window of the restaurant when she was having dinner with Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Hadwin had been stalking Lina for a while now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blushed a little and looked as if she could not tell her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you can't talk about it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, there's nothing I can't say," Lina said and roughly told Grace what had happened back then. "... Then, I got your call and came back. I thought he would be quite open about it, having grown up abroad. I thought he probably wouldn't take it seriously. Who knew&hellip; Uh, he seems to think I'm a playgirl."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt a little embarrassed at this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Listening to Hadwin's &lsquo;accusation&rsquo; yesterday, if the woman he was talking about not herself, she would have thought the woman was a jerk. She said sweet words to an innocent, enthusiastic man and ran away after having her way with him. If they swapped genders, she would be the playboy the audiences despised in eight o 'clock TV dramas!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned after hearing the story of her best friend and Hadwin. According to Jason, Hadwin was not a simple guy. He was scheming and manipulative, but her best friend...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would believe a thing like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He has been looking for you for years?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess so..." Lina said, embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Although we saved you from him yesterday, I don't think he'll leave it at that," Grace said. "How are you going to handle your relationship with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina scratched her head in distress. "I don't know. Let's take one step at a time." Speaking of which, her phone was still with Hadwin. She had to buy another one later and report the loss of her phone number.</p></div>
