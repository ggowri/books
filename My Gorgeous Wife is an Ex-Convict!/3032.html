        <h1>Chapter 3030</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took a quick step forward and grabbed the other person, saying, "If you dare to touch her, I will make you regret ever being born."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cold and fierce voice made the middle-aged woman shudder, and a sense of fear rose from the bottom of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who is this man, exactly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda approached the child and comforted them, saying "It's okay, everything will be fine. Auntie will call the police and they will take care of the bad person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda spoke and took out her phone, dialing the emergency number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the woman saw that Valda had called the police, she struggled even harder to get away, shouting, "Let me go, let me go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But how could Brian have let go?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The onlookers have now realized the truth and are blaming the middle-aged woman, especially those who were eager to help the woman earlier. They are so angry that they want to rush forward and beat her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She actually pretended to be the child's mother. Is she planning to kidnap the child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could there be such a heartless person! Kidnapping children, may they be struck by lightning and have a miserable death!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If this child is really taken away by this woman, what will happen to him? The child's family might be ruined!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This kind of human trafficker should be sentenced to a heavy penalty!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the police arrived and took the middle-aged woman into custody. They then asked Valda and Brian to come to the police station to give a statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, Valda and Brian ended up at the police station again, not long after the crayfish incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, however, it is in the name of assisting from the sidelines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And Simon also went into the police station together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda told the police Simon's name and his father's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police officers at the station had heard of George's name and quickly called the Gregory family to inform them of the situation. They asked the Gregory family to come and pick up their child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Gregory family is currently searching for their child and things have become chaotic. When they heard that the child was at the police station, they immediately responded and said they would come to pick them up right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing Valda say her own name and her father's name, Simon looked at her in a daze and asked, "Are you really my mommy's friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda crouched down and said to him, "Not right now, but both your mommy's friends and I are good friends! I know your mommy's name is Amber, I know she's been through a lot in the past, and I also know that even though she's not in Deer Capital now, she loves you very much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon's eyelashes trembled, and then he stubbornly denied, "She doesn't love me, otherwise why would she leave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda patted the little one's head and said, "She left because she suffered too much here. Staying here would only bring her more pain. But that doesn't mean she doesn't love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one still had a look of disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda couldn't say much more, as her knowledge of Amber was limited to what Brian had told her on the plane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So Valda decided to tell the little one some comic book stories, about the heroes and characters that little boys usually like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This trick worked and the little one relaxed, slowly starting to talk more with Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian watched Valda and Simon interact and was lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that if they had children in the future, she would surely often talk about topics that interest children with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would definitely be a great mother!</p></div>
