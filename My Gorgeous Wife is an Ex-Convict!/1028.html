        <h1>Chapter 1027</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The corners of Grace's lips curled. "Alright, got it." Lina was like the light in her dark world. She would always grab her and hold on to her when she was in trouble! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina then got into the car with Hadwin Stephenson while Grace got into the black Bentley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina watched as the Bentley drove away. Then, she grumbled to Hadwin Stephenson who was next to her, "Alright, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson drove away from the police station. "Where do you want to go now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Home. Where else?" Lina said sulkily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're in a bad mood, why don't we watch a movie to cheer you up?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Forget it. No movies will work, unless you do another striptease," she blurted out. She recalled him doing it the last time she was drunk but had no memory of it! She only had a vague memory of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she felt that it was a shame every time she thought about it, and in time, it became a regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson squinted a glance at Lina. "If you want to see it, I'll do it for you when you come to my house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost choked!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What did he say? Is he gonna do&hellip; that kind of dance for me? Seriously? Isn't he the patriarch of the Stephenson family? Hasn't he always disdained such&hellip; uh, flirty gestures?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He scorned the boy bands the last time she watched them singing and dancing on TV!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really going to do it?" she asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," he answered right away. He would do anything for her as long as she could be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina gulped. Then, she thought, 'What better day than today? What if he regrets it later? I'm gonna be so upset.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today then," she said at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today?" He was slightly startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's still early&hellip; anyway. Why don't we go to your place first, and you can send me home after doing the striptease?" she said. God knew it was already after nine o'clock in the evening. It was not early at all, and it would be ten o 'clock by the time they got to his place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pondered for a moment before saying, "Alright." With that, he turned the car around and drove toward his mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina got a little thirsty on their way there, so she said, "Do you have anything to drink? I'm thirsty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have a bottle of coffee. Would you like some?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," she answered. She knew where he usually put his drinks and reached for it herself. However, she stopped as if she had thought of something when she was opening the bottle. Then, with a slight frown, she stared at the coffee bottle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina bit her lip and asked, "What if I&rsquo;m pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was stunned. Then, the sound of brakes screeching could be heard. Hadwin Stephenson had stepped on the brakes with a stunned expression to stop the car and looked at Lina in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you suddenly stop the car? It's dangerous!" said Lina as she patted her chest. Fortunately, there were few cars on the road. They would have gotten into an accident if there were more cars. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did you say? You're... pregnant?" Hadwin Stephenson stared at Lina's stomach, his voice out of tune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He rarely lost his composure, but as long as it had something to do with Lina, then such a reaction was no longer surprising.</p></div>
