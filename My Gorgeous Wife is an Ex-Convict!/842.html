        <h1>Chapter 841</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I go to Brian, at least he won't treat me as a game object..." Her voice continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop it. Stop it&hellip;' He did not want to hear any more from her about the possibility of her returning to Brian&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he lowered his head and pressed them against her lips so hard that he swallowed all her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She did not expect Jason to kiss her so suddenly. 'What's this? We've already split up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don't want a kiss like this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace struggled desperately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the harder she struggled, the harder he kissed her. He even held her hands firmly and would not let her move a muscle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was over, he pressed his forehead against hers, and in a hoarse voice, he begged in a mutter. "Don't... go to Brian, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The voice pulled her back to reality from the kiss. "Jason, who are you to say that to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The brightness in his eyes had become anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glared at her as she glared back at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There seemed to be tight tension in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a trace of pain rose from her knees and Grace could not help frowning. Her body unconsciously bent slightly, and her hand touched her knees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, he noticed it. "What happened to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... Nothing..." She bit her lip slightly and endured the pain in her knees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since the last time the pain in her knees flared up, it would come and go these days. Sometimes it was mild, and sometimes it would hurt a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly lifted the skirt of her long dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" She was shocked. The next moment, her two bandaged knees caught his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong with your knees?" he asked with a frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just an old problem. It'll be over in a minute. Mr. Reed, now that I've given you the photo, can you go now&mdash;" she had to started to say</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not even finish her sentence when he suddenly carried her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she knew it, he had carried her out of the rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, what are you doing? Put me down," she cried out, not knowing what he was up to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were pressed together in a straight line as he carried her to where the car was parked not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Put me down!" She was struggling to escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Keep shouting if you want people to come and watch," he said. His heart was filled with a fury that even he did not understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I mad about? Am I mad at her for ignoring her sore knees? Am I mad at her for not taking good care of her own body?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, Jason managed to carry Grace to the car. The driver, who had been waiting in the car, immediately got out and opened the door as soon as he saw Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason got into the back seat of the car with Grace in his arms. He told the driver, "Go to Mingde Hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the same hospital where she had been treated for joint pain and got her uterus nursed.</p></div>
