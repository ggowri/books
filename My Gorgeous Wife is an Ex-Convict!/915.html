        <h1>Chapter 914</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What place do I occupy in her heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this uncomfortable feeling some kind of jealousy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you have come to me if something hadn't happened to her?" he asked as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was silent and said nothing, but her expression said it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A tense atmosphere immediately filled the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, the restaurant staff began to serve their food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A series of exquisite dishes appeared on the dining table, and they looked like the food in posters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace had no desire to eat at all. All she could think about was Kyla and Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Martin Weiss wanted to take Nelson away&hellip;' Grace thought about the last time Kyla was hospitalized with an injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin Weiss didn't even know Nelson existed. Kyla wanted nothing to do with Martin Weiss and even hurt herself. This time&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not imagine it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Eat." Jason's cold voice rang. His long fingers picked up the chopsticks in front of him before he placed some food into Grace's bowl. "Try it out. It's pretty good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said again, "Can you help me get Kyla and Nelson out first? Jason, I&rsquo;m begging you, alright? I'm really afraid something will happen to Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Beg?" He gave a little smile. "This is the second time you've said the word 'beg' to me today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip and smiled wryly, not even thinking that she would use that word on him after the breakup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to ask me. I can help you one time, but it doesn't mean I'll help you a second time," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face paled as her breathing became hitched. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He continued, "However, you have options."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Options?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Are you going to be strangers with me or be my sister?" There was a smile at the corner of his lips as if he was welcoming her into the trap he had prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered. 'Sis... Sis again?' She once thought she was going to be his sister forever. She thought she could protect him, care about him, and treat him like a brother and family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... How can I be his sister again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you choose to be a stranger with me, then I've done the best I can for you. However, if you choose to be my sister, then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice lingered as he continued, "I'll do whatever you want me to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like the most seductive charm to tempt her to agree to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to laugh, but she was sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to love her, so he wanted to break up with her. Now, over and over again, he wanted her to be his sister. She did not understand why he insisted on breaking up but was now forcing her to be his sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was contradictory and ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you going to choose? Do you want to be strangers, or do you want to be my sister?" he asked, staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked into his beautiful eyes and could even see her face in them.</p></div>
