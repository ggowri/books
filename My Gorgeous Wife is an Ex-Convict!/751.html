        <h1>Chapter 750</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My sister once said that a man like Jason can't love a woman at all! He can't trust women. He's the only one in the world he'll ever believe in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Unless Grace can make Jason have no doubts about her. Otherwise, as long as there's a little doubt&hellip;' Lily's eyes darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason is a lunatic. Sis loved him so dearly. Even though Jason didn&rsquo;t love her, she still wanted to marry him. However, Jason didn't even shed a tear for her when she died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now, I'd love to see what would happen to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's Grace who made me so miserable. When Grace gets dumped by Jason, I'll be sure to give Grace another taste of pain!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the Stevens family and the Atkinson family pulled a lot of strings and spent a lot of money, the news about Lily being blacklisted still topped the trending searches list for three days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The families got word that more than one party wanted to put the news on top of the list.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily had been completely humiliated, so to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was in quite a good mood when she saw that the news topping the trending searches list every day. She also praised Hadwin. Incidentally, she also took a screenshot of the trending searches list and printed it out, saying she wanted to make it a memento.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, the day after tomorrow is your birthday, Grace. Will you be spending it at Reed Residence?" Lina asked during the phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her best friend had said before that her birthday this year just happened to be the day after the 49th day of her grandmother's death, so she did not want a big celebration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Just come with Hadwin. If he's free, of course," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure. Hold on. I'll ask him," Lina said and looked up at Hadwin who was in front of her. "The day after tomorrow is Grace's birthday. Are you free to go with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," said Hadwin. Grace was Lina's best friend, so of course he was going to go if he was invited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he would value the people Lina valued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll come over with Hadwin the day after tomorrow," Lina answered on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Grace. They talked some more before ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace put down her phone and turned to Jason, saying, "I've only invited Lina, Hadwin, Kyla, and Nelson to my birthday the day after tomorrow. That's all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together slightly. "Next year, I'll have a big birthday party for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. "It's alright. I think it's good enough to spend my birthday with people who are nice to me. It doesn't matter if it's a big birthday. However, I'm looking forward to the cake you'll make for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took her hand. "Alright. I'll make you a perfect cake the day after tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man like him was willing to make a cake for her by hand. She thought if Grandma was still alive, she must be glad that she found a man who loved her so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From now on, her grandmother who was in the next world need not worry about her anymore, because someone would stay by her side and take care of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's the 49th day of Grandma's death tomorrow. I thought I'd go over and see her," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll ask the driver to drive you there. I'll come and accompany you after my morning meeting," said Jason.</p></div>
