        <h1>Chapter 1706</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at Grace in confusion. "Why do you suddenly want to adopt a child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I saw that Mason kid we met at the amusement park again when I was at Kyla's store today." Grace then told Jason what had happened today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The child isn&rsquo;t related to that family, and his adoptive parents are awful to him. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll continue hitting him in the future.&rdquo; Grace did not think Mason's adoptive parents would restrain themselves after what she said to them today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, once hitting children became a habit, it was hard to change it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since they adopted the child, how about we ask them to pass him to us?&rdquo; asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason smiled faintly. "You seem to care a lot about that child. Do you like him so much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Maybe it's because he's about the same age as Mick and Jasper." Grace hesitated a little before saying, "Plus, there's something special about the kid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Special?" Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "What's so special about him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He's not as ignorant and capricious as the average child. Even though he had bruises all over him, he said it didn&rsquo;t hurt. But it's all the more heartbreaking," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "I don't mind adopting the child, but I don't think he'll be willing. I remember that the boy is quite close to his sister. He wouldn't want to leave her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But even if we adopt him, I won&rsquo;t stop them from seeing each other again. I'd bring him to see his sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But even so, he won&rsquo;t be willing," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why?" Grace was puzzled. "If he joins our family, he won&rsquo;t be beaten and scolded. He&rsquo;ll receive better education too..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But his sister wouldn't be there, would she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But I can bring him to see his sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "But they're not going to be together every day. If he's no longer with that family, he won't see his sister when he wakes up, and he won't see her every night before going to bed. If I were him, I wouldn't want to leave that family either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">From what she had told him about that child, he knew just how important Mason&rsquo;s sister was to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was also because Mason was a child that he was purer than an adult. He would not weigh the pros and cons in making choices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since that child seemed to be indifferent to everything else but only cared about his sister, then he surely would not want to leave her&mdash;not even for a minute or a second!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace wanted to say something else but Jason said, "Why don&rsquo;t we go and ask the child tomorrow? Didn't you say he waits for his sister at the school gate almost every day? So why don't we just go to the school gate and ask him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That's... true! We have to ask him if he agrees to the idea!' Grace agreed but asked in confusion, "Are you going to ask him too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since you care about him, I care about him too. It won&rsquo;t hurt to go see him anyway," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next day, Grace took Jason to Kyla's store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla smiled after seeing Jason. "Mr. Reed, thank you." She knew that Jason had helped her a lot. If it were not for Jason, Paisley Daniels's misdeeds would not have been exposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're still not with Martin Weiss," said Jason.</p></div>
