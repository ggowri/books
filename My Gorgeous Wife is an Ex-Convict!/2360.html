        <h1>Chapter 2358</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the mahjong tiles on the square table as they had not been put away. A look of slight surprise flashed across his eyes. He walked over to Grace with a smile. "It's rare to see you play mahjong. How was it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I lost five dollars," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sum of five dollars made Jason momentarily speechless. After all, few things could render him speechless nowadays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you guys bet five dollars for each round?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, 50 cents," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the four people in front of him. Hadwin Stephenson had the most chips, but he would only get about ten dollars at most since they betted 50 cents each time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's getting late. I came to pick you up. If you don't go back for dinner, I think the two little ones at home won't eat their dinner either," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied in acknowledgment and said to Kyla, "Kyla, let me send you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you." Kyla did not refuse her kindness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as soon as the three walked out of the Stephenson family&rsquo;s mansion, they saw a car driving over. Martin Weiss got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was taken aback. She thought Martin Weiss would only come to Emerald City after a few days, but he was now here. &hellip;He even drove to the entrance of the Stephenson family's mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss walked up to Kyla and nodded to Jason and Grace as a greeting. Then, he said to Kyla, "I heard from your mother that you came here today, so I came to look for you. Are you going home now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll send you home, then," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla whispered back, "Okay." She said goodbye to Grace and Jason before getting into Martin Weiss's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched the car drive away and asked Jason, "Aren't you curious? Martin Weiss has been hypnotized, but why is he with Kyla again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I be curious? That&rsquo;s between them. I only care about you. Even if I'm curious, I&rsquo;m only curious about you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the man in front of her. Moonlight shone on his face. His straight nose, sexy thin lips, and bright peach blossom eyes made him look so gorgeous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What woman would not be moved by such tender gaze from him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after all these years, she was still struck and enticed by his beauty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you... think it's unfair?" she asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his eyebrows slightly as if he did not understand what she meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just that sometimes, I care about many people and things, not just you. But... if you only care about what's relevant to me, will you think it's unequal and unfair?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She somehow felt nervous when she asked that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gazed at Grace as he raised his hand and stroked her hair. "Maybe I would&rsquo;ve asked you to be fair in the past, but... not anymore. There's no absolute fairness in this world. Besides, I know you love me the most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's nervousness instantly turned into a surge of warmth that melted her heart when she heard that. He was changing. He was changing gradually so they could have a better time together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, thank you for loving me so much." Grace could not help embracing the men in front of her. She stood on her tiptoes as her lips kissed his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss seemed to be telling him how much she loved him.</p></div>
