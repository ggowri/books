        <h1>Chapter 1666</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason murmured, "Really? Then hopefully... she&rsquo;ll have no sympathy for Sean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence could not help feeling sorry for Sean. If Grace did sympathize with Sean, then Sean could only fend for himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Also, find out who's behind this. I want to know who's going after Grace," Jason ordered coldly. The cleaner was just a scapegoat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," answered Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Also, regarding Grace and her mentor being sued, find the best lawyer in Emerald City who&rsquo;s experienced with these sorts of lawsuits and countersue. Then look into Damian Harmon to see if he has someone directing him behind the scenes!" After all, Grace was now his wife and the mistress of the Reed family. Anyone with a bit of common sense would not go against the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, he had read the case files and Grace was right. The evidence was solid, and there was no possibility of miscarriage of justice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, was Damian Harmon making such a scene to attract media attention to get something out of it, or... was there another purpose?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes darkened at the thought of this. No matter who was going after Grace, he would protect her and not let anyone hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, Young master Reed, I'll carry out your orders right away," answered Terrence, knowing just how important Grace was to Young master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... what confused him was that Young master Reed seemed to care about Grace as much as back then. If he did not know any better, he would think that Young master Reed had not lost his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car arrived at Reed Residence. When Jason walked into the house, he saw Grace and their two children dancing in the living room. Their daughter was dancing excitedly beside her. Even their son was wiggling his body awkwardly while blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Though he seemed a little reluctant and awkward, there was a trace of joy on his face that Jason had never seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since Grace came back, their son seemed to have become more lively and cheerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace...' Jason stared blankly at the smiling woman who was surrounded by their children. The woman had promised to give him a family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had really given him one now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Grace's eyes looked his way as if sensing his gaze. She could not help but stop what she was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Daddy!" Jasper also saw Jason. She instantly rushed over to him with joy and asked for a hug.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason picked up their daughter and kissed her on her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Due to his daughter's insistence, he made it a habit to kiss her after she returned to the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "You're back. Have you eaten? If you haven't, I saved you some food."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I'll eat some," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, Grace let her son and daughter continue playing and let the maids take care of them while she accompanied Jason to the dining room. She kept him company while he ate. She happened to have something to say to him.</p></div>
