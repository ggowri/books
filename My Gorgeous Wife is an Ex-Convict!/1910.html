        <h1>Chapter 1908</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It turned out he had to suffer such pain every time he touched her. It turned out that was what he meant by giving him more time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she never really listened to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he said that he had always loved her and wanted to be with her, she just wanted to protect herself from being hurt, so she repeatedly rejected him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even when he came to the hospital and asked her if she regretted cutting all ties with him, she said no!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'How did he feel back then?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina wanted to slap herself hard as she thought of it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'How could I... hurt him like that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was also shocked to hear all of this. Her face was full of surprise. She did not expect so many twists and turns in Hadwin Stephenson and Lina's breakup. Five years later, Hadwin Stephenson took down the Jackson family and got rid of his blood curse, thinking he could finally get back together with Lina. However, she unexpectedly wanted to draw a line with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace recalled the time she went to the airport to meet Hadwin Stephenson before he left Emerald City. Hadwin Stephenson's eyes were so indifferent at that time. He must have been so hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at her best friend who was in tears. She knew how miserable Lina must feel when she loved Hadwin Stephenson so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The only fortunate thing was that Lina never aborted the baby in her belly. It was Lina and Hadwin Stephenson's baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Katherine Jackson's voice rang in Grace's ears as she was deep in thought. "Lina, this wouldn't have happened to me if it weren't for you. I'm going to give Hadwin Stephenson an amazing gift!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson said to her men as she spoke, "Give her a good beating. By the way, focus on her stomach!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson took out her phone and tapped on the camera, wanting to film the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina felt her blood freezing. She immediately understood Katherine Jackson's intention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not care if Katherine Jackson wanted to hurt her, but she would not let anything happen to the child. It was her and Hadwin's baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was the baby's mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina's hands and feet were tied. She could not protect her stomach!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Watching their fists aim for her stomach, her mind almost went blank as tears kept gushing out of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, there was a bang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the sound of punches landing, but she felt no pain. Lina stared at Grace, who had rushed over and hugged her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace took the punches for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace!" shouted Lina. Just how painful would that be?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I'm fine." Grace comforted her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'How could she be fine?' Lina hated herself. If she had believed what Hadwin said, would she have found herself in this situation and would Grace still be involved? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Since you two care so much about each other, then both of you should just suffer together!" said Katherine Jackson. If Grace was not a busybody who insisted on helping Lina, they would not have found out that she was the one who tampered with Lina's shot at the community health center. The police would not be after her!</p></div>
