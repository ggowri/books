        <h1>Chapter 1176</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The glance was like a warning for her not to say another word, or he might just have a falling out with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella clenched her teeth, looking embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stella, why don't you go home? I have the nurses here, so I don't need you to take care of me," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Stella was reluctant. "I have nothing to do anyway. I'll just stay in the hospital." It seemed to her that this was the time for her to perform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no need for that." Brian refused again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella only felt like his words were a loud slap in her face, but she could not lose her temper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... I'll go home first," said Stella before walking out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian and Grace were the only two left in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn&rsquo;t have to tell your mother that. It's only natural that she doesn't like seeing me. I understand, " said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With those dark phoenix eyes of his fixed on Grace, Brian said, "If you can understand why my mother doesn't like to see you, can you understand why I said what I said?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. How could she not understand? However... "You and I aren't&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish, he interrupted, "If you're going to reject me, then you don't need to speak it out loud. If you don't hate me to the extent where you could never fall in love with me, don't speak it out loud so easily, okay?" Brian muttered. The high and mighty crown prince of the entertainment industry was begging her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a lump in her throat, and Brian still had gauze wrapped around his body and head. He suffered all these injuries from saving her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I... peel an apple for you?" she said, changing the subject. She took a bright red apple from the fruit basket she had brought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," he said with a smile on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a small fruit knife from the table and carefully started peeling the apple for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her peeling looked clumsy because of her injured fingers, but the scene seemed beautiful to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sat quietly by the bedside. She lowered her eyes and peeled the apple little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sun shone through the glass window of the ward and fell on her body, making the scene look so tranquil and warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to keep this scene in his mind. He wanted to remember it until it imprinted in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here, done," she said, suddenly falling into a trance as she handed him the apple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had once peeled an apple for another man too. He had smiled happily as he ate the apple she peeled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" The corners of Brian's smiling lips froze slightly when he saw Grace in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said quickly, "Nothing. Eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she put the peeled apple into his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took the apple but did not eat it at once. He was still looking at her, who had looked at him earlier as though she were looking through him at someone else with some sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who did she think of when she looked at me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The question flashed through his mind, and an answer faintly surfaced.</p></div>
