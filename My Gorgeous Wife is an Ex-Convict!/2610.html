        <h1>Chapter 2608</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened as her ears heard Martin Weiss say, "I've shown you the wound you wanted to see the last time, didn't I? What's the matter? Are you still interested?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said with a sob, "I just wanted to see if your wound burst open. You carried me all the way here..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not too weak that I can&rsquo;t walk this far. Besides, do you think the wound I got more than two months ago will burst open again?" He mocked her in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla paused, finding herself foolish. It had been more than two months since his wound was sutured, and he did not feel any discomfort. He was naturally fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss ordered the driver, "Drive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car slowly drove away from Weiss Residence and headed toward the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla sat silently in the backseat and said nothing until Martin Weiss suddenly asked, "Why did you go out alone when you've hurt your foot? Did my mother contact you and ask you to leave the mansion to meet her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He learned that she had left the mansion alone after receiving news that her mother's staff had taken her to Weiss Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I only left the mansion to buy some medicine for my ankle. Then I met your mother's subordinate in front of the drugstore after buying my medicine..." While speaking halfway, she exclaimed as if she had recalled something, "I left the medicine I bought at your mom&rsquo;s house! Can you... get the car to stop at a drugstore so that I can buy a new one?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned. "The mansion has a regular supply of such medicine. How foolish are you to go out and buy it yourself? Didn&rsquo;t you ask the servants?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The corners of Kyla's mouth twitched as she said to the driver in the front row, "Driver, can you please stop if you pass by a pharmacy? I'll get down to buy some medicine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes glimmered slightly before he said to the driver, "Don't stop. Drive straight back to the mansion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I need to buy the medicine," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said we have it in the mansion. Just ask the servants for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They won't give it to you?" Martin Weiss asked as he went straight to the point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her red lips together tightly, and Martin Weiss knew he was right. "You're Mrs. Weiss. How could the servants bully you so?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The servants at the mansion don't think of me as Mrs. Weiss," said Kyla. Due to his attitude toward her, the servants did not give her the respect she deserved. They even secretly speculated when she would divorce him and leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Kyla never said the second half, Martin Weiss could figure it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you blaming me, then?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't blame you. We're supposed to be divorced, and it's only natural that you're indifferent to me," Kyla said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the calm tone of her voice made him feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car arrived at the mansion&rsquo;s entrance, Kyla opened the car door and was about to get down when Martin Weiss passed the car rear and picked Kyla up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was shocked. "I... I can walk by myself..."</p></div>
