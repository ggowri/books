        <h1>Chapter 1988</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stiffened as he looked blankly at the person in his arms. 'Yeah, Lina and Mom aren't the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Mom thinks of me as a pawn for power and wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But Lina... would never do that. Whether I'm just a young man she had met coincidentally, president of Stephenson Group, or the head of the Stephenson family, she only regards me as a person named Hadwin Stephenson.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina..." he muttered as he hugged her back. "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her face was pressed against his chest, and she was confused with his words. "What are you thanking me for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you... for coming to look for me!" he said. If she had not come to him, then perhaps they really would have lost each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the following days, all media reported that Stephenson Group could face &lsquo;drastic changes&rsquo;. The drama of mother and son turning against each other seemed to attract a lot of netizens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">People were also speculating about who would win the reelection of the president of Stephenson Group soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Judging from the news reports these days, it seemed that Emily Flowers had the upper hand. Many old shareholders holding Stephenson Group&rsquo;s shares had expressed support for Emily Flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although Hadwin Stephenson held 35 percent of the shares, much more than Emily Flowers's, if most of the shareholders were taking Emily Flowers's side, Hadwin Stephenson was likely to lose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace had been following the news these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After coming back from L City, she did not tell Jason that she had gone there. She had also told the children not to tell him. It was just a secret that belonged to them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason did not ask any questions. It was as if she never took the children away for a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you think Hadwin Stephenson will win?" Grace asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't know. You never know who will win until the last minute," Jason said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If Hadwin Stephenson's mother defeats him, should we give him a hand?" asked Grace. After all, Hadwin Stephenson and her best friend had gotten back together, so she wanted Hadwin Stephenson to win, of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did Lina ask you to help?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace shook her head. "Lina never mentioned it. She said Hadwin Stephenson asked her not to worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason smiled. "Since Hadwin Stephenson said so, he has a backup plan. You have nothing to worry about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace thought about it and agreed, so she said nothing more and got up to see if the children were asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had just gotten up when he grabbed her from behind. She could not even take her first step. She instantly fell into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter, Jay?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you miss me when you were gone?" His voice rang in her ears as his thin lips parted gently and sucked on her earlobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace instantly blushed as her ears burned. "I... I did miss you." If it were not for their agreement about not telling him whenever she went to see Mrs. Watts, she probably would have video called him from time to time when she was in L City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How much did you miss me?" His lips ran down her ears, neck, and shoulders while his fingers unzipped her dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The dress she was wearing today had a zip at the back, which made it easier for him to undo her dress.</p></div>
