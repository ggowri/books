        <h1>Chapter 2289</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gently pulled his hand away as she spoke, "Alright, I really must go home. You should rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll have someone take you home," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your mother has arranged for a chauffeur to take me home, so don't worry," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she came out of the ward, the smile on her face disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Martin Weiss had not stopped her today, maybe she would have told him she wanted to start over with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe some things were meant to be missed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe what she had not said today would never be said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she to blame for loving him too little? Was he to blame for loving her too much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like what Mrs. Weiss said, Martin Weiss could risk her life for her, but she might not be able to risk her life for Martin Weiss. She had too many things tying her down, and she did not have too much attachment to love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it would be better for both of them if it ended here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not need to be so persistent with her and could start afresh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After this, he would not risk his life nor struggle for her&mdash;let alone become so humble for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked out of the hospital with a bitter smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss... and her would eventually go on with their lives as per their original course. What had happened these days was just an interlude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla would visit Martin Weiss in the hospital every day in the next few days. She would bring him food she made and share photos and videos of Nelson on her phone with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything seemed so sweet and harmonious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, only Kyla herself understood that Martin Weiss's time in the hospital might be their last &lsquo;good&rsquo; time together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once he got out of the hospital, it... was time for her to give him an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'm going home," Kyla said to Martin Weiss after packing up her things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you go home after I fall asleep? I want you to stay with me a little longer," he said. He looked a little like a child being affectionate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how mature he normally was, he could not help behaving like a child in front of the woman he loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Kyla as she returned to the chair beside his hospital bed. "Then lie down and go to sleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss obediently lay down on the bed, but his eyes did not close. He was still looking at Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Aren't you going to sleep?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It just feels like a dream these days," he said. After all, he had never dared to think that she would be willing to sit beside him and wait for him to fall asleep one day. "Kyla, tell me. Am I dreaming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart quivered. "No, you're not dreaming."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A smile appeared on his face. "Do you think I'll get the answer I want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was silent as the hands on her lap clenched slightly.</p></div>
