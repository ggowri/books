        <h1>Chapter 143</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can't refuse, can I?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason&rsquo;s eyes flashed slightly, and the smile on his face disappeared little by little. He then slowly straightened up and looked down at her. "No, you can refuse. I can give you the right to refuse, but..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After pausing, he looked at her with a faint smile. "Sis, are you sure you want to refuse?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt that the air around her seemed to be frozen at this moment. If she agreed, she could indeed get a lot of things or even change her own destiny.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it had been someone else who had said these words to her, perhaps she would have agreed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But, Jason... She had a kind of fear towards this man. It was true that he had never really tried to deal with her. However, just one sentence from him had caused her much suffering in prison.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">During the three years of imprisonment and even the court hearing, no one dared to accept her case after hearing that it was Jason's fianc&eacute;e who had died in the car accident.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even the false evidence and those witnesses who unanimously accused her of drinking made her question whether he was the one behind it all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This man was like her nightmare who pressed her down so hard that she could barely breathe. Ever since she had discovered his true identity, whenever he had approached her, her body could not help but stiffen.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would tremble whenever she had any sort of physical contact with him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could she keep such a man by her side?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After taking a deep breath, she tried to suppress the trembling in her body and said to him, "Yes, I want to refuse."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His face fell, and his black eyes filled with coldness. "Do you really not want to stay with me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah," she replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He suddenly sneered and said, "Well, I didn't expect that one day I would be rejected by a woman. Grace, think about it carefully. If you don't have my protection, what will happen to you in Emerald City? Even if the Atkinson family doesn't trouble you in the future, do you really intend to sweep the road for the rest of your life?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She bit her lip and said, "That's my business."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His thin lips were pursed into an almost straight line, and an anger rose up from the bottom of his heart. For the first time, he had tried to do this kind of thing for a woman, but she did not appreciate it at all. Instead, she was trying her hardest to get away from him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">How long had it been since he was angered to this extent? He really wanted to strangle her, but he couldn't bear to do so.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I couldn't bear to?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't believe that that term could be used to describe himself one day. It was truly ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason then left without saying a word. It was not until this moment that Grace's tensed body relaxed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the doctor came to Grace for the daily checkup, he told her that she had recovered. The blood test showed that there was no remaining drug in her system.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Can I be discharged now?" Grace asked.</p></div>
