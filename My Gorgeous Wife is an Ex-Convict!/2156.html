        <h1>Chapter 2154</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">By the end of the week, Grace brought the triplets, William, and Veronica Barlow&mdash;a total of five children&mdash;to Lina's place. Lina looked at the five children and could not help saying to her best friend with a smile, "With all these kids out here at once, people will think you run a kindergarten."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at the row of children standing behind her and smiled. She did seem like she ran a kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, there you are!" said Kyla as she stepped forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla. Hey, where's Nelson?" Grace saw no sign of Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He's on the second floor looking at Tina. He'll be down in a minute," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough, Nelson Corbyn soon came down from the stairway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Jasper saw Nelson Corbyn, she immediately ran to Nelson with enthusiasm. After Nelson Corbyn walked down the stairs, she hugged Nelson Corbyn and shouted enthusiastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn naturally picked Jasper up. Although he was only nine years old, he had grown stronger from his training recently. He did not feel tired even when he picked Jasper up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hehe!" Jasper wrapped her arms around Nelson's neck as she giggled and kissed him on his face to show affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one liked to show affection to people she liked by kissing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Of course, now that the children were older, Grace had also taught her daughter that kissing was for family and friends&mdash;not outsiders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jasper clearly classified Nelson Corbyn as her family and friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The nine-year-old Nelson Corbyn had a better understanding of gender awareness. He instantly blushed when Jasper kissed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson, why are you blushing?" Jasper looked at Nelson Corbyn in confusion. Her eyes moved. Then, she kissed Nelson Corbyn's cheek several times as if she had discovered a secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn's face turned even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mommy, Nelson's face is so red!" Jasper turned her head and said to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not help laughing. Lina and Kyla also laughed, so Nelson Corbyn blushed even more. Meanwhile, Jasper laughed even more. Melodious laughter filled the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The other children did not seem to have much of a reaction, except for William, who looked down when he saw Jasper Reed's smile and Nelson Corbyn's flushed cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does Jasper... like Nelson Corbyn? Jasper looks so happy every time she sees Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Jasper keeps talking about how good Nelson is. It's as if he has no flaws.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If there&rsquo;s a flaw, it's only that Nelson Corbyn can't hear and he needs hearing aids. Hearing aids can help him hear but not experience music, which became Jasper's regret as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She once said, 'I hope Nelson can hear how amazing music sounds like for ordinary people one day. I&rsquo;ll play something great for Nelson. Maybe he'll think it sounds good!'&rsquo;</p></div>
