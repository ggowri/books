        <h1>Chapter 97</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I like it." Jason smiled slightly and put down the tag in his hand. "Sister, I will buy you a thousand or ten thousand sweaters in the future. You will wear them as much as you like."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"A thousand or ten thousand? How would I even have a chance to wear them all?" Grace couldn't help laughing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need such things. Come here. Please. Let me measure the size of your hand."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she spoke, she took a leather ruler and took his hand to make some measurements.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He frowned. He could feel that her hand was very cold when their skin touched. &ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t knit, your hands are too cold," he said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's okay. Hey, stay still. If you keep moving your hand, the measurements will be no good," she muttered before taking his hand and once again adjusting the positions of his fingers. "We're in the roomright now, so it can't get that cold. If it was in the early morning outside or when I was sweeping the road at night, now that's cold. Even if I wore gloves during those times, my hands would get so cold that I could barely feel them."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's eyes seemed to be covered by a thin layer of fog, which covered up the guilt in his eyes. Actually... he could have easily made her stay away from this kind of life and prevented her from doing this kind of hard work.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Perhaps in the beginning, he only felt that it was interesting, so he stayed by her side and called her &ldquo;sister." But now, ever since he started to have different feelings for her and planned to bring her under his wing, there was no need for her to do this hard work again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's done!&rdquo; she proclaimed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After finishing the measurements on his hand, she lowered her head and started knitting again. However, because her fingers had been injured in the past, her movements were not as agile as they could be. The knitting speed was also slower as a result.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It&hellip; hurt him to see her so injured.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Injuries that on some level were due to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&rdquo;Sister, today is the day of Sean's engagement to Lily." He suddenly said, "On the way back, I saw that the street where their engagement party's venue was at was still blocked. Many people ran over to see."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I know. I saw it on the Internet. There were so many people there earlier that no one could squeeze in even if they wanted to," she said. There was not a trace of oddness in her voice.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't you feel disappointed?" He watched her closely and observed her reaction.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Disappointed?" Her hands paused and she seemed a little surprised.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you hadn't broken up with Sean, the grand occasion today might have been yours," he said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Even if nothing happened to me back then and we didn't break up, all of this would not be mine. The Stevens Family had never accepted me. Even if nothing happened, I would have broken up with Sean sooner or later." Grace looked calm.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back then, every time she went to the Stevens Family, she would make great efforts to get on the Stevens parents' good side, hoping to be accepted into the family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But, the result was nothing more than a joke.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once, at a gathering, she was mocked by Sean&rsquo;s mother on the spot, who called her a sparrow that wanted to become a phoenix and said that she would never succeed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, at that time, she had to smile obsequiously and ease the atmosphere after being insulted. Thinking about it, she really didn't need to make herself go through all that. No, she would never subject herself to such treatment again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The car accident simply made her see reality more clearly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason smiled slightly as if he was quite satisfied with Grace's words. "My sister deserves better! Sean is really nothing."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's right. If Lily likes such a man, then she can go ahead and have him," Grace smiled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Did you see any other interesting news?" he asked casually.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I did. I saw Jason Reed's back," Grace said. "Speaking of which, he is quite mysterious. There are no pictures of him on the Internet. Someone posted a photo showing his back today, and it didn't take long before the post was deleted."</p></div>
