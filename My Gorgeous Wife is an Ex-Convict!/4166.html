        <h1>Chapter 4164 Let's Get Married</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I know," Chandler replied, "but I want to marry Tina. Besides, marrying her won't hinder her studies. After we get married, she can continue doing what she loves and wants to do. I won't stand in her way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So just because you want to marry, I should marry my daughter to you right now?" Hadwin gave him a look that said, "Don't even think about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina couldn't help but speak up, "Dad, it's me who wants to marry Chandler as soon as possible. Chandler was forced to agree because of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin turned to look at his daughter, "You forced him to marry you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes," Tina quickly nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin frowned, "What sweet words did Chandler say to you that made you speak up for him? Let me tell you, a man's sweet words are the least trustworthy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina had the urge to comment, did Dad forget that he himself was a man?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And she heard from Mom that Dad used to say sweet words to Mom too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Um... I swear, Chandler really didn't say any sweet words!" Tina quickly raised her hand to assure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Then why do you want to marry Chandler as soon as possible?" Hadwin said impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Because I might already be pregnant, Dad. Don't you want your grandchild to be born out of wedlock? Or do you want me to get married with a big belly?" Tina touched her belly and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin almost choked on his breath and it took him a while to extend his hand, pointing at his daughter, "What did you say? You're pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Um... there's a possibility," Tina added, after all, she still didn't know if she was actually pregnant or not, "But in the Hunter family, I had sex with Chandler without protection, so..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although Chandler told him that his mother drugged her in the pastries, so she acted that way after eating them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But in fact, she felt that even if there was no drug, maybe she wouldn't be able to resist anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The drug simply unleashed her desires, and she had always hoped to marry Chandler and have children early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So Tina wasn't really against Auntie Adele drugging her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, the other party did it with the hope that Chandler could resolve this source of pain sooner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But before Tina finished speaking, Hadwin had already grabbed Chandler by the collar, glaring at him angrily, "Is this how you followed my instructions?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm sorry," Chandler apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You should be sorry!" Hadwin punched Chandler directly in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler staggered back a few steps, his cheek red and his lips bleeding, showing a hint of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was dumbfounded, watching her father about to throw a second punch. She quickly stepped forward and stood in front of Chandler. "Dad, I... I already said it earlier. It was me who forced myself on him. Chandler was coerced."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin sneered, "If he didn't want it, could you really force him? Tina, move aside!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Men understand men the most. In Hadwin's eyes, Chandler deliberately seduced his own daughter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Enough!" Lina, who had been standing by, suddenly spoke up. "If Tina and Chandler truly want to get married, then let them!"</p></div>
