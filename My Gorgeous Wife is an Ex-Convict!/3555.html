        <h1>Chapter 3553</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, I'm William. You must be Roger," William greeted the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I'm Roger," the other person replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you for accompanying Jasper today. I hope she didn't trouble you," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's eyes flickered slightly. William's words seemed to imply a sense of ownership, as if he was telling others that Jasper belonged to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whether or not she caused trouble for me is between her and me. And as for saying thank you, even if someone should thank someone, it should be her thanking me, right?" He spoke, looking towards Jasper. "Do you want to thank me for accompanying you this afternoon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Jasper suddenly felt a bit speechless. It seemed like she was the one accompanying him this afternoon, and he was just doing experiments with chemical reagents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in front of the two boys, she still awkwardly said, "...Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're welcome," he replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William pursed his thin lips and said to Jasper, "Let me walk you back to your dorm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." She replied, then said goodbye to Roger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching the backs of the two as they walked into the campus together, a shadow passed over Roger's handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had always been like this for him. They were like people from another world, and he was completely different from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, do you want to be friends with me?" Roger suddenly spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's footsteps suddenly stopped, and he turned to look at the other person in surprise. "Are you willing to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lifted his feet and walked step by step towards her. With a slight smile on his lips, he said, "You said everyone in the school thinks we're friends, right? Well then, let's be friends. It's not a bad thing to be friends with the princess of the Reed family, is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, she felt a hint of disappointment. Was this person only willing to be friends with her because she was the so-called princess of the Reed family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, if you don't want to, then forget I said anything," Roger continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper pursed her lips and took a deep breath. "I don't mind. We can be friends from now on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great, we're friends now!" he said, extending his hand for a handshake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated for a moment, but then reached out her hand and the two hands clasped together. William, who was standing beside them, saw this and a hint of worry and unease flashed in his eyes, gradually spreading in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This Roger, regardless of whether he is Lawrence or not, is having an impact on Jasper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afterwards, William accompanied Jasper to the entrance of the girls' dormitory. "Do you really intend to be friends with Roger?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there any reason not to?" Jasper replied strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if he's not Lawrence?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That can also be a friend," she replied. "He plays the guitar very well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned, his worries and anxieties mixing together and causing him to blurt out, "Do you only make friends with people who play the guitar well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was like that, Lawrence was like that, and even Roger was like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was nothing else important to her?! This made him even more anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, not really," Jasper blinked. "I like people who play the guitar well, but not everyone who plays well can be a friend. And even if someone doesn't play the guitar, they can still be a friend. Not all of my friends play the guitar."</p></div>
