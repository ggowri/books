        <h1>Chapter 3894</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mother felt that he lacked emotions more than Mason, and that it was due to the five years she was not with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't think there was anything wrong with his personality or psychology.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the welcoming ceremony, Mick finally had some time to rest and walked to the hotel's backyard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, because of his younger brother's wedding, the hotel was exceptionally lively, but the backyard was relatively quiet, which allowed his ears to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leaning against the corner wall, he looked up and could see the sky through the huge transparent glass above the courtyard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wedding... it's really tiring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From now on, a man and a woman will build their own family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The love of parents and the commitment to marriage have never made him take marriage lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that person is not the one he will love for life, then he will not easily get married!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason and Jasper, the people they love, grew up with them since childhood. Their love was a long-lasting one, and everything seemed to fall into place naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other hand, Mick didn't have any special childhood friends. Even if he wanted to find one now, he's too old for that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about this, Mick couldn't help but laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was he thinking about, childhood friends? Did he really need one?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like love, some people need it, but it doesn't mean everyone does.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if someone never falls in love in their lifetime, does that mean they will have a regretful life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a crisp slap interrupted Mick's thoughts in the courtyard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned his head and saw two girls at the entrance of the courtyard. One of the girls had a red mark on her face, obviously the one who was slapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other girl had her back to him and was cursing, "You have no shame, following your mother here. I warned you not to come! Can you even attend this wedding today?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My dad asked me to come," the girl who was slapped said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shut up! You have no right to call me dad. You're just a burden brought by your mother! You better leave now. If you show up at the wedding banquet, you'll only embarrass my family!" the girl who slapped her shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick raised an eyebrow. Wedding... as far as he knew, there was only one wedding being held at the hotel today - the Reed family's wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Were these two girls also guests attending the banquet?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Mick was startled because the girl who was slapped was looking at him through the girl who was standing in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This girl saw him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two locked eyes, but the girl's gaze only showed a moment of surprise before returning to normal. She didn't look at him again, but instead lowered her eyes and said, "Fine, I won't attend the wedding banquet. But you should apologize for slapping me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Apologize? You want me to apologize to you? Who do you think you are?" the other person said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then should I go to the wedding with this swollen face? What will everyone think? It will only be more embarrassing. I can handle the embarrassment, but can you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person glared at her fiercely, almost stomping their feet in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the girl who was slapped just stood there quietly, like a hunter waiting for prey.</p></div>
