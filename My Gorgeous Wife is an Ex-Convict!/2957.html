        <h1>Chapter 2955</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And upon hearing Zelda's words, Ginger looked at Valda with a hint of disdain in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really want to wear some branded clothes, why don't I give you some of my old clothes instead? Although I've worn them before, each piece is worth several thousand yuan. Ginger bought them for me. Whenever I want to buy clothes, Ginger will buy them for me without considering the price."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda is giving Valda her old clothes as if she's giving charity, while also showing off their affection, implying a significant difference between the two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda first saw her old classmate, she thought Zelda was pretty good. But now, she feels completely indifferent towards Zelda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need, you can donate your old clothes to those in need. I have my own clothes," Valda refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda looked displeased for a moment and was about to say something when suddenly a man's voice interrupted, "Valda."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda looked up and saw a man wearing a white shirt and black pants walking towards Valda. It was clear that he knew Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is this the friend that Valda was talking about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda felt a twinge of jealousy as she gazed upon the man's impressive appearance before her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, she and Valda both came from poor families. She was abandoned by her parents and left to live with her grandparents, while Valda had to rely on the kindness of others for a place to stay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda's grades have always been better than hers and she is one of the top students in the class. Additionally, Valda has a talent for drawing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And she, her grades are at the bottom of the class, and she doesn't have any particular talents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The teacher often compares her to Valda, saying that Valda is good at both academics and drawing, while she is not good at anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After graduating from high school, she didn't get into college and went straight into society. Later, she used connections to obtain a fake diploma and then helped Ginger, her current employer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Ginger became wealthy overnight due to the demolition of her rural family's home, which brought her several million yuan, she is still unhappy with her age and appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But for her, this kind of partner is already quite good. In the past, when she met with her old friends, they would always look at her with envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She has always been very satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, looking at the man standing next to Valda, she suddenly felt a little uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I met a former high school classmate," Valda said to Brian. "You go ahead and sit first." She clearly had no intention of introducing Brian to Zelda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian naturally understood Valda's meaning, and with a casual glance at Zelda and Ginger, he sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda took a step forward and addressed Brian, who was already seated in the chair. "You're Valda's friend, right? I'm Zelda, her high school classmate. Valda is a really nice person, even though she comes from a less privileged background. She worked hard in school, and I think she wears knock-off designer clothes just to impress you. I hope you don't mind."</p></div>
