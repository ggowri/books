        <h1>Chapter 2735</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think children... are important. A mother can risk her life for her children," Valda Theller muttered suddenly. Her mother had done so too. She gave her life to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If her mother had not held her tight in her arms at the time, she would have died too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think it's right to do so?" he asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "It's not whether it's right or not but whether one&rsquo;s willing to or not. If I ever have children, I&rsquo;ll do anything for them when they&rsquo;re in danger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pupils constricted as if he had not expected her to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were so clear, and her voice held no hesitation. They seemed to tell him silently that she was telling him the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. I want some silence for a while," Brian snapped before closing his eyes again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pressed her lips together and said nothing more. The car suddenly became quiet again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car drove to the apartment compound where Valda Theller's apartment was, Valda Theller got out. She wanted to say goodbye to Brian, but Brian&rsquo;s eyes were still closed. It looked as though he had fallen asleep. She said nothing in the end and only closed the door carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car drove away slowly, Valda Theller sighed and walked into the apartment compound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, the dark phoenix eyes slowly opened with a hint of self-mockery. 'What's wrong with me? I felt indescribably flustered when facing Valda Theller that I could only pretend to be asleep.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was only an ordinary woman, but when she said it was not about whether it was right or not but whether one was willing, he could not even look at her in the eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This woman is really...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Head back to the mansion," Brian coldly instructed the driver in the front row.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the driver answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked out the car window at the receding scenery. Grace should believe that he and Valda Theller were really dating after today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted him to love someone else, so he would show it to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Weiss Residence, Mrs. Weiss looked at her son and said, "I heard from the lawyer that you haven't given him the divorce papers yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss turned the cup of tea in his hand and indifferently replied, "Yeah." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since Kyla has signed the divorce papers, why aren&rsquo;t you ending the marriage sooner?" Mrs. Weiss said disapprovingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had caused her son to donate his liver to her twice. He almost died on the operating table. Even though Kyla had given birth to two children for her son, she still wished Kyla could stay far away from her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's up to me to decide when to divorce," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss frowned before her expression changed suddenly. She asked, "Do you still have feelings for Kyla and can't bear to get a divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said coldly, "Mom, I told you I don't have any feelings for her anymore. How could I have let her go if I still have feelings for her?"</p></div>
