        <h1>Chapter 2137</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The crowd looked at the boy in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The boy continued mumbling, "If the only way to be with Tina is to get married, then I'll marry her when she grows up. She can't marry anyone but me! I'll save her if you agree!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Master, do you really want to save her?" Uncle Andy was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy ignored Uncle Andy. He just looked at Hadwin Stephenson. "Do you agree to that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he agreed, would his daughter have to marry this boy in the future? He knew nothing about the boy. If he agreed, he would bind his daughter to this boy for life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she did not like him and liked someone else, then he...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the child before him was his last hope to save Lina. He could not let Lina become a vegetable and lie on the bed for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay! If you can save Lina, then I'll let Tina marry you after she grows up!" said Hadwin Stephenson as he gave him his word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy nodded. "Then lead the way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They hurried to Lina's ward with the little boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy looked at Lina, who was lying on the hospital bed. Her face was pale, while all sorts of equipment were attached to her body. She looked half-dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Take off all the equipment!" the little boy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The crowd looked at each other. In the end, Hadwin Stephenson found a nurse to remove the equipment attached to Lina's body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy opened his hand to Uncle Andy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Uncle Andy understood and asked for a clean bowl. Then, he took out a dagger and said to the little boy, "Young Master, bear with it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I got it!" the little boy said impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The dagger cut the boy's forearm while carefully avoiding the meridians. Blood gushed out and dripped into the bowl. Uncle Andy only stopped the bleeding and bandaged the boy when the bowl was half full.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Feed her this blood. It should help," the little boy said. Then, he said something that shocked everyone. "She had difficulty delivering because someone injected a substantial amount of toxins into her body that made it difficult for her to give birth. But the toxins metabolized quickly. It&rsquo;s difficult to detect in blood tests."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" Hadwin Stephenson seemed startled, not expecting this to be the reason for his wife's difficult labor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Injected toxins? Who is it? Was it the hospital&rsquo;s doctors or nurses? Or was it the person taking care of Lina?' Countless speculation flashed through Hadwin Stephenson's mind for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy seemed very pale and a little weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Uncle Andy quickly picked up the little boy to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Uncle Andy said to Hadwin Stephenson before leaving, "Don't forget your promise today. If you break your promise, the entire Hunter family will make the Stephenson family suffer!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After they left, the crowd in the ward seemed to finally regain their senses. Hadwin Stephenson looked at the bowl in his hand that was half-filled with blood. He carefully fed Lina the blood without any hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would find out whoever tried to hurt Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was careless back then, causing Lina to get seriously hurt and lay in the ICU ward while he had to give in to the Jackson family! Now, he was careless yet again.</p></div>
