        <h1>Chapter 4407: Unexpected</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Harley gasped, before he could even react, he was already dragged onto the bed by the other person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... feel so uncomfortable..." Calvert's voice murmured, his body heavily pressing down on Harley. His eyes were hazy as he looked at her, and his feverish body kept rubbing against </span><span>hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was startled by Calvert's sudden move. But then he realized what was pressing against his body. It was his...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, his body is just reacting to the medication right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is a normal occurrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley, can you help me..." His voice was hoarse, and his beautiful black eyes were full of mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thought crossed Harley's mind, recalling Karen's words. Could she really handle it if he were to be with other women in the future?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it really right to be together, unbound by anything, all in the name of selfishness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just how much did she like him? At this moment, his actions didn't bother her at all. In fact, she even wanted... to knock him over, to see him moved, to be the only one reflected in his eyes...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even... they want to make him cry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of sick joke is this?! Harley thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me... I feel so awful... so awful..." Calvert's voice continued to echo in her ears, the mist in his eyes growing thicker, as if tears were about to burst forth at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley took a deep breath, as if making some kind of resolution, "Alright, I'll help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand slowly moved down, touching his vulnerable spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't even shared a kiss yet, but now, she had touched him there. This... was probably a triple jump, Harley thought to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nuzzled into her palm, his eyes involuntarily closing, a soft hum escaping his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feeling comfortable?" She was quite curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So...so good, I really...like...Harley...can you touch me more..." Calvert pleaded, the burning heat in his body seemed to lessen a lot at this moment, due to such touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so comfortable, so comfortable that he didn't want to wake up from this dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only in her dreams would she help him like this, their bodies intimately intertwined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After satisfying his physical desires, Calvert suddenly shivered. His previously hazy thoughts gradually became clear, and the sensation was still so vivid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be... are you saying, this isn't a dream?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Still not feeling well? Why has your face suddenly turned so pale?" Harley's voice echoed in Calvert's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body shivered, his eyes still tightly shut, his entire body becoming incredibly tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those weren't just dreams... then what he had done before was undoubtedly a desecration to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even went as far as to... on her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will she get mad? Will she make our previous agreement null and void?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was afraid that once she opened her eyes, all the beauty would vanish into thin air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really not feeling well? Is it your eyes that are bothering you? You've been keeping them closed. I can take you to the hospital right now." As her words trailed off, it seemed like she was about to get up and leave him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for the hospital!" He suddenly opened his eyes, grabbing her in one swift motion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm okay... just... I'm sorry, I'm sorry..." He apologized to her in a flustered manner, "I thought it was just my illusion, that's why I treated you like this... If I knew you were real, I would never have..."</span></p></div>
