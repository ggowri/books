        <h1>Chapter 3214</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper said to Grace, "Mommy, I won't bully Lawrence. If he really doesn't want to play the piano for me, I'll think of another way to make him want to play for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper spoke confidently, as if he had some incredible method up his sleeve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace couldn't help but laugh. When she arrived at the agreed place, she finally saw the little boy playing the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He appears slightly shorter than Jasper, very thin, wearing obviously worn-out clothes, and a pair of cheap cotton shoes. Standing beside the little boy are a couple who are likely his parents. Judging from their clothing, they also seem to belong to the lower strata of society.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the situation, Grace was a bit confused. After all, a piano is not a cheap thing to play. Even for a regular piano lesson, it would cost around 200 yuan per session. And if Jasper can play the piano well enough to be called good, then she must have studied for a considerable amount of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can this family afford long-term piano lessons? Or have they already exhausted all their resources to pay for their child's piano lessons?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you sure you haven't got the wrong person?" Grace asked Jason in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason smiled slightly, "Do you think there's a possibility that I got it wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was speechless, well, it seemed like there really wasn't that possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Jasper had happily run up to the little boy, "You were playing the piano that day, right? But why did you run away? I wouldn't have done anything bad to you. If you hadn't run away that day, we would have met earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little boy lowered his head, looking somewhat timid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you still keeping your head down? I'm Jasper. Mommy said your name is Lawrence, right?" The crisp voice rang out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy named Lawrence finally slowly lifted his head, and what he saw was Jasper's brilliant smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of smile made Lawrence dazed for a moment, until his mother's voice rang out, bringing him back to reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence, say hello to Miss. Reed!" Wilona urged her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">You know, the ones who appeared in front of them today were Mr. and Mrs. Reed of Emerald City, and their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Emerald City, many people who wanted to curry favor with Mr. Reed couldn't do so. However, now, because the little princess of the Reed family listened to the son playing the piano, she wants to meet him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For families like theirs, this is nothing short of an opportunity. If they can really win over this little princess, their fate will change and they can escape their current impoverished life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence stuttered as he spoke, "I...I'm called Lawrence." Other than that, he couldn't think of any other words to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona sighed inwardly at her son's reticence and lack of communication skills. He was extremely introverted and she wondered if this personality trait would make it difficult for him to win the favor of the little princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That day, I heard you play Liszt's Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige and I really liked it. Can you play it again for me?" Jasper looked at Lawrence with bright, sparkling eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I don't play well..." Lawrence said, feeling a bit awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't think so. I think you play very beautifully, with a unique flavor that sets you apart from others," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence blinked his eyes, a different taste, what could it be?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He doesn't understand what she means by these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the side, Wilona May turned to her son and said, "Lawrence, Miss. Reed wants to hear you play the piano. You should play for her now!" This is a great opportunity to show off his skills!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence looked even more confused, as he had heard his parents talk in private about how this was a chance for their family to turn their fortunes around if Miss. Reed really liked his piano playing.</p></div>
