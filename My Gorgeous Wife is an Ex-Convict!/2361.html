        <h1>Chapter 2359</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they got into the car, Grace said, "I have something I need your help with."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have to ask me for help? Just tell me what you want and I'll get it done," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, it's about Jacqueline Bowman..." Grace talked to Jason about the solution she came up with. Jason frowned slightly. "If it's like what you said, it's feasible. But it's going to involve so many people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't want Jacqueline Bowman to get away with it. I know that maybe we can find other ways to send her back to prison even if she does get probation. But I don't want people like her to look down on the law," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled. He understood her sense of justice and respect for the law. Otherwise, why would she choose to be a lawyer after everything that had happened to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll take care of it. It&rsquo;ll be as you wish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Kyla found that Martin Weiss was not driving toward the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you going?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's have dinner first. I&rsquo;ll take you somewhere after dinner," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I told my mother I'll be home for dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And I told your mother I'll be having dinner with you outside," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was instantly speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had come to Emerald City, which also meant their deal was about to begin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Live... like a normal married couple for over a year? A normal married couple...' The thought of it confused Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had already imagined all kinds of embarrassing conditions he might put forward before she went to beg Martin Weiss. One could say that Martin Weiss had given her enough dignity by making such a request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least he did not hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car stopped in front of a restaurant in Emerald City. The two got out and asked for a private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What would you like to eat?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anything's fine," she said. All she could think about was how a &lsquo;normal married couple&rsquo; should behave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss ordered the food and stretched out his long arm to pour Kyla some tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why do you keep looking at me like that? I would think you love me if I didn&rsquo;t know how indifferent you are to me." There was a note of sarcasm in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly came back to her senses as her face reddened. Flustered, she picked up the teacup in front of her, wanting to drink some water to conceal her embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her hand trembled, and the water from the teacup shook and spilled all over her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Kyla exclaimed as the teacup in her hand fell to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly got up and nervously took Kyla's hand. He quickly pulled her to the bathroom in the private room and splashed cold water on Kyla's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cold water was splashed onto the back of her hands, and Kyla whispered, "The water... was lukewarm. It's not too hot." In other words, it did not matter even if it spilled on her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss froze, finally realizing that Kyla&rsquo;s hand was not red or swollen. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;In the heat of the moment, he did not notice whether the water was boiling hot or not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss turned off the tap awkwardly and said gruffly, "Be more careful next time."</p></div>
