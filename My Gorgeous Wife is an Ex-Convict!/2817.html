        <h1>Chapter 2815</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't need to thank me all the time," said Brian. He then looked at Valda Theller and asked, &ldquo;Are you doing anything later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head. "No, I have nothing planned for today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Accompany me somewhere later," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are we going?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll see," he said and checked the time. "We can have our lunch there if we go now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got back in the car, and Brian drove toward the north of tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only after driving for more than half an hour did Valda Theller's expression change. This road... She remembered it to be the way to the canyon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got into an accident on this road. This road had appeared hundreds of times in her dreams!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where... Where are you taking me?" murmured Valda Theller as she paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The canyon," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She grew paler at the sound of those words. "No, I don't want to go there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That place was a sin to her. The accident would never have happened if she had not insisted on going there and making a fuss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's where your problem is. In that case, why don't we solve it?" Brian said. Speaking of which, he had never been someone who would meddle in other people's business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his heart broke when he saw her trying hard to smile while crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could see that she had not gotten over the incident and was still haunted by it. He wanted to help her dispel it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The canyon is nothing to be afraid of. It was a journey that your parents wanted to accompany you on. Since the journey stopped before you reached the destination, it's better to complete it now," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Complete the journey?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can I complete it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car approached the accident site, Valda Theller's pupils widened as she felt her blood freezing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was pale, and her eyes filled with fear as her drooping hands clutched at the hem of her dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The violent crash, her father's scream, and her mother's shriek kept ringing in her ears. Blood seemed to spread before her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Whose blood is it? Is it Dad's blood or Mom's blood?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could see was blood... Her body began to tremble, and even though she tried to stop it, she could not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't... Don't go any farther. No! No!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her consciousness seemed to be screaming desperately. When the car finally arrived at the accident scene, she could not help shrieking. Then, there was the screech of the emergency brake.</p></div>
