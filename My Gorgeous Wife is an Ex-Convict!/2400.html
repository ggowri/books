        <h1>Chapter 2398</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had done some research beforehand, so she specifically talked about how she balanced her career, marriage, and children to have more common topics to talk about with Whitney Herrera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang out. "I don't know if all this is true. Who on earth are you? What's your agenda for approaching Whitney at this party?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head and saw Louise Mitchell speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's eyes flickered with jealousy. Grace's elegant and luxurious outfit was worth a fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She probably borrowed everything she&rsquo;s wearing using some connections!' Louise Mitchell thought to herself. She remembered Grace as one of the three people who barged into Amber Mitchell's ward that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Agenda?" Whitney Herrera and the rich wives nearby were surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." Louise Mitchell approached Whitney Herrera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What had happened between Amber Mitchell and Herman Moss was suppressed by all three families. Although she was Amber Mitchell's sister, there was no permanent enemy in business. Moreover, she was the young madam of the Gregory family, so she socialized a lot with the Moss family. She would often talk to Whitney Herrera at parties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Louise Mitchell saw Grace talking to Whitney Herrera, the first thing that came to her mind was Amber Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This woman probably approached Whitney Herrera to learn more about Amber Mitchell!' With that in mind, Louise Mitchell suddenly panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must not let anyone bring up what had happened back then. Otherwise, some problems would probably arise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled slightly.."Oh? I do wonder what agenda I have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell narrowed her eyes. She could not say she saw her in the mental hospital in public, so she said, "You&rsquo;re dressed up like some aristocratic lady today. I wonder what your family does? I can see you're not from Deer City. Your outfit probably cost a fortune, though. I suspect you spent a fortune to dress up like this just to join this party.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's questioning was aimed to embarrass Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The aristocratic ladies who previously talked with Grace were also watching. Whitney Herrera even looked at her suspiciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm from Emerald City, and my husband is also a businessman in Emerald City. My husband prepared this outfit for me. I don't know how much this cost." Grace was telling the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason learned that she was attending a party, he contacted the couture boutiques and jewelers in Deer City to help her choose a gown and matching jewelry to wear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, so your husband bought it for you?" Louise Mitchell asked with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if he did?" Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How dare you lie? Do you know how much these things costs? Or... are they knockoffs?" Louise Mitchell said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those gathered around them now looked at Grace with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, these aristocratic ladies and socialites disdained knockoffs the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So it's just to keep up appearances!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong with this party today? Can any random person attend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This person is probably here looking for some opportunities to suck up to the wealthy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone around them discussed. Louise Mitchell was so smug that she was just waiting for the woman to leave in disgrace.</p></div>
