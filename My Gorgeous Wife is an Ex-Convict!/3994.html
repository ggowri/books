        <h1>Chapter 3992</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick picked up a nearby bottle of alcohol and drank from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had done something foolish because of Nancy, allowing a stranger to hug him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door to the private room was pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out, I want to be alone," Mick said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, I...I just wanted to check on you," Irene's gentle voice sounded as she walked into the room and closed the door behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the news that Mick was coming to the hotel today, she kept an eye on this private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw that everyone else had left the room, she took the opportunity to come in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone with her current status, it was very difficult for her to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And since the last time she went to the company to look for him, the people below wouldn't even let her in now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick had given orders not to let her step into the company building again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she could only seize the opportunity now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick looked up and saw Irene walking towards him. A hint of disgust flashed in his eyes. "I told you, I'm not your brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene pursed her lips and showed a pitiful expression. "Brother, do you still dislike me? But I like you so much. I will never betray you. I can do better than Nancy, a thousand or ten thousand times better. Brother, can you give me a chance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she raised her hand and began to take off her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" Mick's eyes were cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, do you feel a little hot now? I can help you." Irene hinted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had previously mixed into the team of waiters and came in with the drinks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she had added some drugs to the drink that Mick was going to have when no one was paying attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calculating the time, the drug should be taking effect now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick frowned, "You--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just like you, brother. Once you try it, you'll find that I can give you a lot of pleasure," Irene continued to take off her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!" Mick's voice became even colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Irene was only left in her underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a triumphant smile on her face. "Brother, it wouldn't be good for you if I went out like this now. Others might think that you have bad intentions towards me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene took a step towards Mick. "Are you feeling uncomfortable now, brother? I can help you with that. And afterwards, I won't say anything to anyone. Brother, I just want to be closer to you, even if it's only once..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she had that one time, she would have a hold over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she came in, she secretly brought a small camera for recording.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since there was no surveillance in this VIP room, she could record their intimate moments and use it as a weapon by editing the footage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she asked to spend time with him and he still didn't have feelings for her after a while, she could destroy the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Mick didn't want to be involved in any scandal, spending time with her would be the simplest solution. Mick should agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she had the opportunity, she would make Mick more and more dependent on her!</span></p></div>
