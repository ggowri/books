        <h1>Chapter 1798</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh? Then why didn't you go in?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She rolled her eyes at him. "I'm pregnant. You know how loud a concert can be. What if people bump into me and squeeze by me after I go in?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Doesn't he know this when he has accompanied me to many concerts?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes softened. "Were you afraid that the baby in your belly might get hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I..." She froze and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's voice rang in her ears again. "Anthony Sherman thinks I refuse to take responsibility after getting you pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He misunderstood!" she said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well then, do you want me to be responsible for you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyes met his, and at that moment, she felt as if she were drowning in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you? Do you want me to be responsible for you?" His voice was so mesmerizing that she wanted to nod and say yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No... No!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had never wanted him to take responsibility like this...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina shook her head, and the pressure around her instantly reduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes dimmed almost unmistakably. &ldquo;Does that mean you don't want to marry me? Would you rather be scolded by your parents and let your child become a bastard than have anything to do with me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She bit her lip with her teeth and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He approached her again. "Lina, do you hate me that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She turned her head to not look at him. Looking at him would only make her more and more flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because even she had no idea what was the best thing to do next!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If I died one day, would you be sad and regret not being with me in this life?" Hadwin Stephenson asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina felt an instant pang in her heart. She instantly turned her head around and asked quickly, "Why would you die? Aren't you alive and well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who knows what tomorrow will bring? Maybe there are certain pains and agony that will kill you if you can't endure it," he murmured with a self-deprecating smile on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just like how she had no idea how much pain he was in when he held her hand. The blood curse on his body made the pain come in waves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The blood curse on him had not been lifted yet. He still had to undergo two more sessions. He could only get rid of the blood curse after getting through them. If not, he would die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What about you? Do you want me to be alive and well?" he asked her in a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's unnecessary for me to want anything. You now have complete control of Stephenson Group. With so many people protecting you, the Jackson family is no threat to you. If you ever get sick, you can also find the best specialists to treat you," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson still asked persistently, "I'm just asking whether you want me to live?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her throat seemed to burn. Lina took a deep breath. "I want you alive and well." She had never wanted him to die. All she wanted was for them to put the past behind them and live their own lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A smile rose from the corners of his lips, and it spread to his eyes. For a moment, those dark night-like eyes shone like they were dotted with stars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay. If you want me to live, I'll live. I'll stay alive no matter what!" he said as he wrapped his arms around her and embraced her.</p></div>
