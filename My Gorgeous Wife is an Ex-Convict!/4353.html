        <h1>Chapter 4351 The Annoying Person</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley turned around and saw Laurel Blair. The Blair family and Harley's mother were distant relatives, so she had known Laurel since they were kids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had only met a few times when they were kids. It wasn't until middle school when the Blair family leveraged their relationship with Harley's mother to get a job at Hart Group, that they moved to Emerald City. Only then did she start seeing Laurel more often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Harley didn't really like the Blair family. In fact, the Blair family was from the same village as Harley's grandmother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, since Harley's mother was an orphan, Harley's grandmother was actually an old lady who had saved Harley's mother back in the day. Later on, Harley's mother started to consider this old lady as her own mother and brought her to live together in Emerald City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Harley's grandmother has passed away, Harley's mother still cherishes the kindness she received from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's grandmother was buried in the village cemetery, so every year, Harley's father would accompany Harley's mother to the village to pay their respects to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blair family, on the other hand, was constantly trying to establish a relationship with the Hart family, leveraging their distant kinship with Harley's grandmother and the favor they had once done for her. They even went around boasting about all the kindness they had shown to the grandmother in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later on, Harley's father arranged a cushy, high-paying job for Laurel's father at Hart Group. This finally brought some peace to the Blair family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley once asked his father, "The Blair family only owes a small debt of gratitude to our grandmother. At most, they could just give some money. So why did you arrange things this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just to make your mother feel better, she doesn't want your grandmother to owe anyone any favors. So, why not give them a bigger favor instead? Whether it's money or a position, it's all trivial to me. Since it's a small matter, why not do it in a way that makes your mother happy?" That's how Harley's father answered her at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't like how Laurel is always sticking to me, acting all sycophantic," Harley said unhappily. The way Laurel looked at her always gave her the feeling that he was up to no good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, just try to avoid him as much as possible. Also, it's great that you can distinguish between genuine intentions and ulterior motives. As the heir to the Hart family, </span><span>many people won't be sincere with you, simply because you're beneficial to them. But don't feel sad about it. In life, everyone can't treat you with sincerity. Finding just one person who does is actually enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, faced with Laurel's somewhat lecherous gaze, a hint of disgust flashed in Harley's eyes: "What a coincidence, I'm here to have dinner with a friend, so let's not chat for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get going, Calvert," Harley said, eager to leave. She really wasn't in the mood for small talk with Laurel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to leave, but there was no way Laurel was going to let Harley just walk away like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurel immediately stepped forward, blocking Harley's path: "Since it's just a meal, why don't we eat together? Coincidentally, I'm also having dinner with a few kids who are my dad's colleagues today. They're all employees of the corporation, so we're practically family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurel tried to hold Harley's hand with a smile, but Harley dodged it directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know exactly who my family members are," Harley said. "And, I just wanted to have a meal alone with my friend today. I don't want anyone unrelated to interfere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurel's face fell, "Do you think I'm irrelevant? We're relatives, after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, someone who had been dining with Laurel came out. Seeing Laurel in conversation with Harley, they immediately walked over.</span></p></div>
