        <h1>Chapter 1857</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After his father died, Old master Reed bought the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old master Reed bought the house, and everything in it remained the same. According to the old master, it was so Jason would never forget what had happened!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wanted him to remember how his father died and how his mother abandoned him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car slowly drove toward the old house, and Jason once again closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I just fooling myself? Will I eventually turn out like my father? Will the love I think I have turn out just to be my own wishful thinking?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace returned to Reed Residence, but Jason had yet to come back. When she called him again, his phone was switched off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Where the hell is Jay?' Grace was anxious, but she could not find out anything when she asked Terrence. Uncle Kwan could not give her any answers either when she asked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the children came home, Grace had to fake a smile and pretend nothing had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason still had not returned when it was time for dinner. Jasper asked curiously, "Where&rsquo;s Daddy? Is Daddy not coming home for dinner today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Daddy's busy with work today. He's going to be late, so let's eat first," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper did not suspect anything but insisted on saving some food for her father. That way, he would have food to eat if he came back hungry. However, doubt flashed across Mick Reed's peach blossom eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William only kept his head down, quietly eating his meal as if all this had nothing to do with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, he was just an outsider. Even though he now lived in the Reed family&rsquo;s house, he was still an outsider.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew he was only Jasper Reed's toy. He could be thrown away when his owner got tired of playing with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... he could not help but hope that Jasper would not be tired of playing with him so soon and would be interested in him... for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because he seemed to enjoy being around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he was too young to understand what this feeling was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When it was time to sleep at night, Jasper quickly fell asleep with William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While Grace did not involve the children in the adults&rsquo; grudges, she still thought it was inappropriate for her daughter to sleep with an unrelated boy. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, she thought she should be teaching her children certain things about gender at this age. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when she mentioned it to Jason in the past, he did not seem to care much about it and said, "The fastest way to make a child lose interest in a toy is to let her play with it as much as possible. She&rsquo;ll slowly lose interest once she gets bored."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But William isn't a toy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He's just a new and interesting toy to Jasper."</p></div>
