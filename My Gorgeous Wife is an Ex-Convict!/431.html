        <h1>Chapter 430</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want to take a stroll here?" Grace was still somewhat incredulous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there something wrong?" Jason retorted, "Didn't you also take me to a night market last time? It's similar to this place."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But, I didn't know your identity at that time," Grace said. If she had known he was Jason, she would not have taken him to the night market to buy clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the difference? No matter if it's in the past or future, I'm your Jay." Jason looked at her thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That look on his face&hellip; Ugh, it was like nirvana to Grace! "Then&hellip; you go ahead and take a stroll." She pursed her lips. Nevertheless, she still followed him around the food court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, when Grace was still in college, she used to visit the place often with her classmates. However, once she started working, she naturally stopped frequenting it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, after being in jail for three years and being released, she struggled to find food and clothes. What more was the idea of taking a stroll in the area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already evening at this time, and the crowd in the area was gradually beginning to build up. Grace and Jason walked around and bought snacks and skewers as they filled up their stomachs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a food street market, but there were also many other stalls that sold clothes, accessories, gadgets, and knick-knacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each item was priced cheaply and affordably; most of the people who were shopping around the area were students.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they walked, Grace noticed that many young women had a tendency to look at Jason from time to time. In the eyes of the ordinary women, Jason was a handsome guy who&rsquo;s looks were comparable to top idol stars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she went to the night market with him previously, his bangs were let down, and they almost covered his eyes. This time, Jason had combed his bangs backward. Consequently, his forehead was revealed, and it made his handsome face even more apparent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two passed by a hair accessory stall, Grace said, "By the way, I need to buy a few hairbands." The hairbands she had were losing their elasticity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, the hairbands she usually bought were cheap ones that were sold at around five bucks for a bundle of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace would usually buy them online. However, now that she could buy them at a stall, she might as well buy them here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glanced at the hairband on Grace's hair, and upon taking a closer look, noticed that the white rubber band within the black colored hairband had made its way to the surface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace squatted down in front of the stall, looked at the hair ties for sale, chose the cheapest one, and started bargaining with the stall owner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could finish bargaining, Jason pulled her up to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, I'm not done negotiating on the price yet," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll buy it for you," Jason said. There was a trace of constraint in his tone. He had never noticed that the rubber bands she used were cheap and had become worn out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, even though hair ties were dirt cheap, she still had to bargain with the stall owner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, there was an indescribable feeling in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I..." Grace wanted to say something, and Jason halted his footsteps abruptly. Jason turned his head around and asked, "Grace, is it really that hard for you to accept something from me?"</p></div>
