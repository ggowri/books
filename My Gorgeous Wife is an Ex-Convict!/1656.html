        <h1>Chapter 1654</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her daughter would not be called a homewrecker if Hadwin Stephenson and Katherine Jackson had already broken up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Sweeney said, "Probably. Alright, alright, this should be the end of this matter. We'll ask the bodyguards here when we can go back later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But if Katherine Jackson and Hadwin Stephenson broke up long ago, does that mean Hadwin is still in love with Lina? Lina, why don't you and Hadwin&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mom, didn't I tell you before? It's not gonna happen between us. Forget about it!" Lina said quickly, stopping her mother's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Sweeney could not help but sigh. She was quite fond of Hadwin Stephenson. Although she was furious that Hadwin Stephenson dumped her daughter back then, she could not help thinking that Hadwin Stephenson seemed to still have feelings for her daughter, who had remained single for the past five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, alright! What's so good about that Stephenson boy? He dumped Lina when she got into that accident. We don't want him even if he's rich and successful now! My daughter will certainly find someone else to marry!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I was just saying," muttered Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, alright. Mom, Dad, I'll have nothing to do with Hadwin Stephenson after it's all over. We should be able to go home in a couple of days," Lina said quickly, scared that her parents would quarrel over her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when they asked the bodyguards when they could leave, they said, "Mr. Stephenson hasn't given us the orders, but you three can go back once he permits it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Can you contact Hadwin Stephenson and ask him?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Sweeney, you can contact Mr. Stephenson yourself. Mr. Stephenson said he has never changed his phone number. You can contact him at any time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina fell silent at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She stared at the phone in her hand. She was alone in her room that night but did not dial Hadwin Stephenson's phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had deleted Hadwin Stephenson's phone number from her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, that number had long been imprinted in her mind. Even if she tried hard not to think about it and forget it, his phone number was still so vivid in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Should I contact Hadwin Stephenson?' Lina hesitated. She did not make the call but buried herself in the covers like an ostrich.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She constantly told herself, 'Even if Hadwin Stephenson isn't engaged to Katherine Jackson anymore and they have no feelings for each other, it's not going to happen between him and me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Hadwin Stephenson is just my ex-boyfriend!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina gradually fell asleep as she thought about it in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She only opened her eyes when she felt thirsty. She got up to get a drink. She picked up the glass by the bedside table and took a sip from the water she had not finished drinking before falling asleep earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was still drinking when her sleepy eyes met another pair of eyes in the room. They instantly widened. She choked on herself and coughed drily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ahem... Ahem, ahem..." Lina awkwardly put the glass aside, staring blankly at Hadwin Stephenson who was sitting on the chair in her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The moonlight fell on his face, making him look cold and lonely.</p></div>
