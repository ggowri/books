        <h1>Chapter 3298</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper..." Lawrence said with a mix of embarrassment, pleading, and guilt. "Can I still continue learning the piano with you? Even if you don't want to be friends with me anymore, I still want to learn the piano with you. I can play many songs, whatever you like, I'll play it for you. Is that okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pleading voice was even choked with a hint of sobbing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper hesitated for a moment, but then she remembered the things she had heard before. She made an effort to pull her hand back from Lawrence's fingers and said, "No need, I don't want to listen to you play the piano anymore, Lawrence. I don't like being used by others, and I don't like others using my family. I used to enjoy your music, but I won't anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Jasper finished speaking, he got into the car with the driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A black sedan slowly drove away from Lawrence's sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence stared blankly at the car that was gradually moving away. His thin body trembled with a great fear that swept over his entire being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">You must really dislike Jasper, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, will he no longer be able to play the piano or attend classes with Jasper? Will he even be unable to see Jasper anymore?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever he thinks about this, he feels very uncomfortable, even more so than being scolded or beaten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona walked out of the house and saw that Jasper was gone. Her son was standing still in the same spot. She immediately ran up to him and asked, "Where's Jasper? Why didn't you let her come in and sit down? Did you not treat Jasper well just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence finally came to his senses and looked at his mother with a red nose. "Jasper said that I don't have to please her anymore, and she doesn't want to hear me play the piano anymore. She won't like my music anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona was shocked, "What did you say?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mummy, Jasper already hates me. Does that mean... I won't be able to see Jasper anymore?" Lawrence choked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what followed was a loud slap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His young face was immediately swollen and red from the beating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona was shaking her son's small shoulders as if she was going crazy, asking, "What did you do to Jasper? Why does she hate you? Don't you know how important she is to our family? Our family's future depends on Jasper. What will happen to us if you keep acting like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Wilona cried and hit Lawrence repeatedly, she even forgot to consider that Lawrence is just a ten-year-old child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although his body was in pain, Lawrence endured his mother's beatings silently without uttering a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because for him, these pains are simply not worth the discomfort he is feeling right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was clearly most afraid of being disliked by Jasper, but why... the thing he feared the most still happened?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He only had his music to make her happy, but now even his music doesn't please her anymore!</p></div>
