        <h1>Chapter 2960</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;I prefer a daughter,&quot; Brian said seriously, &quot;How about we have a daughter first? As for a son, it&#x27;s up to you.&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;I can&#x27;t do something like giving birth all by myself,&quot; She casually remarked.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Mm, I know, so I&#x27;ll help you with it,&quot; he said.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Her face suddenly turned red. </span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;I...I&#x27;m not ready to...to have kids yet,&quot; she stuttered, quickly burying her head in the photo album and continuing to look at the pictures.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Well, just let me know if you want to. I&#x27;m always there for you,&quot; Brian uttered.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda&#x27;s face turned even redder. She felt that Brian had become more talkative since they started dating again, and he often said things that made her blush.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">The photo album was a vivid chronicle of Brian&#x27;s journey, from a fresh-faced elementary school boy to the high school teenager he had become. In those early elementary years, he radiated a youthful innocence.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">By middle school, Brian had grown taller. His boyish charm was slowly replaced with a more aloof demeanor, a spark of teenage rebellion flickering in his eyes. </span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">In his high school photos, you could see the man he would become. His gaze had matured, more reserved yet still penetrating. His face, handsome and boyishly charming, was framed with bangs that fell across his forehead. His straight nose and inviting lips added to his appeal. He stood tall, almost the same height he was now, although his frame was leaner then.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Now, Brian was mature and charming, but Valda couldn&#x27;t take her eyes off the younger version of him.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">To her, he should be the hottest guy in school that nearly all girls had a crush on. And when she stared at the photo, she suddenly had some inspiration.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; Brian asked. He was a little puzzled when he noticed that she had been staring at the page for a long time.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">To him, the pictures on this page were just a few ordinary photos from his high school days, nothing special.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Wait, I...I have an idea!&quot; Valda suddenly exclaimed. &quot;Can you lend me these few albums?&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">After speaking, she picked up the albums and hurried towards her room.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Wanting to know what idea she had in mind, Brian followed along and only saw Valda go back to her room. </span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Then she</span></span></span> <span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">took out a pen and sketchbook and started drawing.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">The character she drew on the sketchbook was purely cartoonish, but it had a hint of resemblance to Brian when he was in his high school days.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">The character was wearing a school uniform. And Valda drew a lot of versions of the character from different angles.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">At the sight, Brian finally realized that she was designing the character&#x27;s profile.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Just like that, Valda kept drawing, occasionally flipping through those albums.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">At this moment, her attention was completely focused on the painting, and she didn&#x27;t even notice that Brian was also in the room.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Brian found it amusing to see her so focused on her work like that.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">It seemed to be the first time he had ever been ignored like that. After all, even without his wealth and background, just his appearance alone made him the center of attention wherever he went.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">But at this moment, she didn&#x27;t even spare him a glance. And he couldn&#x27;t help but keep his eyes on her serious face.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">The more Brian looked at her, the more he wanted to keep staring at her. </span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">With her by his side, he finally didn&#x27;t feel lonely, as if the hole in his heart was mended.</span></span></span></p></div>
