        <h1>Chapter 2480</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps Jason was confident that even if he allowed Grace to stay in Deer City, others would not be able to change Grace's mind?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, there&rsquo;s indeed nothing to worry about. I was overthinking," Brian said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Brian turned around to return to the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian!" Grace stopped him. "Thank you for helping Amber Mitchell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled. "Don't mention it." It was never Amber Mitchell he wanted to help. It was just her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she had things she wanted to get done, he was willing to give anything to help her get it done. However, it was pointless to tell her his concern now as it would only add to her distress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was good as it was...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they returned to the living room, they heard Daley Moss say to Amber Mitchell, "What you said today had better be true. If someone did plot the accident, I&rsquo;ll find out who was responsible and help my eldest brother get justice. But if what you said is false and you just don't want to face the fact that you killed my eldest brother as you fear retaliation from the Moss family, then&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Daley Moss could finish, Amber Mitchell said, "If what I said is false, I&rsquo;ll pay for Herman's life with mine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The statement surprised everyone in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly said, "Amber Mitchell, won't you fail Herman Moss's intention to save you by saying that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell smiled wistfully. "But Herman doesn't know how much I want to be with him. If I can't find out the murderer and the truth, it's a good idea for me to be with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her dark eyes were full of determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Amber Mitchell's affection for Herman Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Grace felt her throat burning. She did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the Moss family&rsquo;s house, Grace accompanied Amber Mitchell to an apartment. The apartment was small, only about 50 square meters. However, it was big enough for Amber Mitchell to live in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ve paid the rent for a year, so you can stay here first. I've also transferred a sum of money to the online account linked to your phone. It should be enough to support you for a while," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you leaving Deer City?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll probably stay for one more week to tie up some loose ends. I was worried about you being alone in Deer City and wondering whether to invite you to Emerald City. But you still have some unfinished work to do. Besides, it concerns the Moss family. I'm relieved you're working with the Moss family now. If you&rsquo;re done with things here, come to Emerald City whenever you want! Kyla and I will welcome you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, how is Kyla doing?" Amber Mitchell asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's been resting well. She'll have a C-section when she&rsquo;s unable to hold on anymore, but... no one can tell what will happen then,&rdquo; said Grace. She wanted to return to Emerald City as soon as possible to see Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Guilt took over Amber Mitchell's face. "She wouldn't be in this state if weren&rsquo;t for me.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It has nothing to do with you. Kyla's pregnancy this time was difficult to begin with. The doctors had recommended she abort the baby, but she was reluctant to do so. She had prepared for the worst when she decided to have the baby," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the key now was Martin Weiss. Even if Martin Weiss was willing to save Kyla... Martin Weiss himself would be in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Should they let Martin Weiss exchange his life for Kyla's?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Kyla survived, she would probably be unhappy all her life.</p></div>
