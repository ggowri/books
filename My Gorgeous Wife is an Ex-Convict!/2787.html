        <h1>Chapter 2785</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost bumped into him, making his teeth ache slightly. However, his senses then focused on the soft touch of her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kissed him earnestly, giving him a strange feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, he never liked to kiss. Though he had dated many women, he had never let anyone kiss him... In his opinion, kissing could only be considered a simple touch of skin, and he would not kiss people randomly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was not repulsed by her kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, her lips finally moved away from his lips. However, her head tilted and rested on his shoulder. She fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Valda Theller helplessly, not knowing how much she could remember when she woke up tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting the blood test report, Brian returned to the consultation room with Valda Theller in his arms. After confirming that there was nothing wrong with her, Brian returned to the car with Valda Theller in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Head back to the mansion," Brian indifferently ordered the driver in the front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." The driver drove slowly to Brian's private mansion. On the way there, Brian looked at the woman&rsquo;s sleeping face and could not help falling into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Can I possibly fall for this woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or should I ask myself if I can fall for anyone else? If possible, I hope I can fall for Valda Theller.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller only thought she had a very long dream. She dreamed that Brian had appeared and saved her from danger when she was suffering the most&hellip; Then, she seemed to be touching him and saying a lot to him&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt like a wonderful dream!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, all she had when she woke up was a headache!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help moaning. Just then, a voice rang out. "Are you awake? I'll have someone bring the hangover soup over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller tried hard to sit up as she half-opened her eyes to see Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What are you doing in my house?" she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This isn't your house. It's my mansion. You got drunk yesterday, and I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to take care of you if I went to your house, so I brought you here," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Drunk?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her confused mind finally recalled yesterday's events, and her face turned pale instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he saved her last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But then what? What happened? Why don't I remember anything?' If she tried to think about it, the pain in her head would feel like it was about to explode.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah..." She moaned again as she frowned deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is the headache terrible?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she muttered. Then, she felt fingers touching her forehead and around her temples. They pressed with moderate force to relieve her headache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about this? Do you feel any better?" Brian asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I seem to feel better," muttered Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian continued to massage her temples, and Valda Theller's uncomfortable moans gradually turned into comfortable grunts.</p></div>
