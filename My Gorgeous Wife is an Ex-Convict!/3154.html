        <h1>Chapter 3152</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite knowing how others would attack, they did not avoid it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This courage is admirable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it takes this kind of courage to stand by Brian in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To Valda, Amber sends sincere blessings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few women talked about partying during Valda's latest live stream. They ultimately decided to congratulate her on her new home once it's decorated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the video call ended, Valda received a call from Camille. "Sis, you were amazing today! There are posts online about you, and in your circle of friends, there are a bunch of big shots' wives protecting you. No one will dare to mess with you in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda found Camille's words amusing, "But luckily, today went pretty smoothly, so this matter should slowly settle down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your side is fine, but Tracy's side may not be as easy. She has been heavily criticized online and someone has even released her past scandals. In short, she's completely finished this time!" said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda listened and felt no sympathy towards Tracy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, my new home will be ready soon. Grace and the others said they want to come together to celebrate my housewarming. Will you come and join us?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, of course you should come!" Camille quickly said, "When you say Grace, do you mean Jason's wife Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, in addition, there are those big shots' wives you mentioned, and also the future big shots' mommies..." Valda joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille chuckled, "From now on, I bet no one will dare to criticize you online. Before they do, they'll have to think about the group of wives behind you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them chatted for a while before ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda put down her phone and raised her hand to rub her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Feeling tired?" A voice sounded in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, a little bit." She nodded. Although today's events went more smoothly than expected, she had been tense every day for the past few days. Finally relaxing today, the exhaustion that had been accumulating for days suddenly surged up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian pulled Valda into his arms and said to her, "Close your eyes, I'll give you a massage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." She obediently closed her eyes, and his fingers began to massage her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It felt very comfortable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His movements were gentle, and his breath filled her nose, giving her a strong sense of security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if she didn't have to worry about anything with him by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda completely relaxed, leaning against Brian's arms. She faintly heard his voice murmuring, "Valda, I won't let anyone hurt you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was his way of protecting her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda fell asleep, and Brian looked at her sleeping face in his arms. His eyes deepened, and after a moment, he picked her up and walked back to the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He carefully placed her on the bed, afraid of waking her up.</p></div>
