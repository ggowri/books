        <h1>Chapter 3569</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, during lunch with William, Jasper couldn't help but look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As everyone in the dormitory had speculated, does William like her? Not the kind of liking between childhood friends, but rather...a romantic interest?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She is now 19 years old, and although she is inexperienced in matters of the heart, she is not completely ignorant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Why have you been staring at my face all day?" William's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper snapped out of her thoughts, realizing that she had been caught staring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hesitating for a moment, she decided to be direct and asked, "William, do you have someone you like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was taken aback, not expecting her to ask such a question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she looked at him with an open and honest expression, as if genuinely curious about the answer to her question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her clear and candid gaze made him feel as though any lie spoken in front of her would be a desecration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he admitted honestly, his voice slightly hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, he liked her. He had liked her for over a decade, ever since he first laid eyes on her. And as time passed and they experienced various ups and downs together, his feelings for her only grew stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To him, she was his redemption, the person who saved him from the shadow of his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, it was because of her that he returned to the Barlow family and became William instead of Randall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to become someone worthy of her and to one day get what he truly wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So...do I know the person you like?" She asked the second question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes flickered slightly, "Yes, you do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This answer made Jasper's heart inexplicably nervous. Could it be that...what their roommate had guessed was true? They had talked about almost everything since childhood, even when they were in different cities, they often had video calls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the people she knew, she had never seen him particularly interested in any girl, and even their conversations rarely touched on other girls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper took a deep breath and asked her third question directly, "So, am I the person you like?" She didn't want to beat around the bush or guess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted a clear answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze fixed on her, her question was unexpected yet somehow expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he smiled and answered with a gentle voice, "It's you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From beginning to end, it was always her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stared blankly at the person in front of him. So... does he really like her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They have been together for so long that sometimes, even appearance can be ignored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person in front of him has a handsome face, looks gentle and refined, and when he smiles, it reminds people of the spring scenery!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No wonder he is popular in school with such qualities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, now he says that she is the one he likes. So how should she respond?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, Jasper and William were caught in a staring contest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I admit that I like you, but I'm not asking for an immediate response," he said, sensing her hesitation. "You can take your time to think about it and give me an answer later. And until you've made up your mind, you don't have to give me an answer at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She blinked, "But then, won't you... have to wait forever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm willing to wait, and you don't have to feel any pressure," he said. "Jasper, everything between us is still the same. Nothing has changed except that you now know that I like you."</p></div>
