        <h1>Chapter 1067</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've set up a stall to make money while I'm here to buy some food. Whether I can finish it is none of your concern," said Martin Weiss. Then, he walked over to one of the empty tables and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was so out of place in all his glamor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn did not expect Martin Weiss to come here and order food! 'What does he want?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She cooked with her head down while her mind whirled with thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Plate after plate, she served the food to the small square table in front of him, and before long, plates of food had already filled up the small square table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was glad her stall only had ten dishes in total. Otherwise, the small square table would not be able to accommodate all the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Kyla Corbyn was serving the last dish, Martin Weiss suddenly said, "You're a much better cook than before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn shivered a little. "People change."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she stayed the same, maybe she would not be able to raise Nelson at all! She no longer applied all sorts of skincare products like before and only applied light makeup when she went out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she would apply a face cream that cost a few dollars when it was cold. Makeup&hellip; was almost a distant thing to her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before this when she wanted to learn how to cook, her hands were covered with hot blisters. Even if the blisters had now faded, there were some scars left, and her palms were full of calluses too. They were nothing like before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Kyla Corbyn went on to serve the other customers. Martin Weiss looked at her busy figure, his eyes darkening. Even though the woman was tired, she still smiled at her customers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... her smile seemed so humble and so different from the bright smile she used to have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss picked up his chopsticks to take the food in front of him and began to eat bite by bite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He ate each mouthful slowly as if he was carefully tasting it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn tried her best to ignore Martin Weiss and just regarded him as an ordinary customer. However, as the day got later, the people on the road lessened and he seemed to stand out more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was still eating slowly in his seat. He looked so elegant and gentle, forming a great contrast to his surroundings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he caught a lot of passersby&rsquo;s attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of them was a woman wearing a revealing outfit. It was as if she had just come out of a nightclub. She walked to Martin Weiss's table, drew a chair, and sat down. She said seductively, "Would you like me to join you, sir? I&rsquo;ll do anything you want tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was clear what she was implying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was saying such words to Martin Weiss. How could a person like him take a fancy to a woman like her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss glanced coldly at her and only said, "Go away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said it in a light tone, but it made the woman shudder as if she might never see the sun again if she stayed a second longer!</p></div>
