        <h1>Chapter 2793</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Yes, we&rsquo;ve met several times. Martin Weiss did love Kyla very much back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Back then?" She was stunned. "Doesn&rsquo;t he love her now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not sure. I know that Martin Weiss left Kyla and returned to L City after he donated his liver to Kyla a second time. I'm afraid I don't know what happened between them, but Martin Weiss probably won't separate with Kyla if he still loves her," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never leave the person he loved most if it were him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had only met Kyla once but had a good impression of her. "I hope Kyla has a happy marriage. They have two children together... And her husband has donated his liver to her twice. I don't think average couples can do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If she hadn&rsquo;t given birth to the second child, Martin Weiss wouldn&rsquo;t have needed to donate his liver twice. Kyla nearly died on the operating table to give birth to the second child. Do you think she was selfish or selfless?" Brian smiled sarcastically as he stared at Kyla's short news report that was on loop on the phone screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That... That's just because she wanted to keep the baby," muttered Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else is there to talk about if you lose your life for your children? Kyla is fortunate to have Martin Weiss willing to risk his liver to keep her alive. If Martin Weiss hadn't risked donating his liver a second time, Kyla would already be six feet under." Brian sounded agitated. He was so different from his usual indifferent self.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the second time he had expressed disapproval of women taking risks to have children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you worried about Grace?" The soft female voice rang in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian froze instantly and stared blankly at the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller gently said, "I know you're worried about Grace's condition because Grace is also insistent on giving birth to her unborn child. Women not only risk their lives to have children because the babies are their blood and human life but also because they love the father of their children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she whispered, "The more you love them, the more risks you&rsquo;re willing to take. The deeper the love, the more risks you&rsquo;ll take."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Love?" Brian burst into a wry smile. "Yeah, Grace... loves Jason very much. She... loves him very much..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His smile looked forlorn, making Valda Theller's heart suddenly clench. "I... I'm sorry. I... I shouldn't have said that." She should not have upset him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not wrong. What is there to apologize for?" he said as he looked down gently. His long lashes seemed to cover his eyes. "Don't you think it's unfair? I met her first, but she fell in love with Jason."</p></div>
