        <h1>Chapter 2588</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Veronica Barlow was willing, Grace would not mind bringing Veronica Barlow to live with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that was a story for another day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Veronica Barlow bit her lip. Grace's answer was neither good nor bad for her. At least she could still live with Mason for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Goodbye, aunt Cummins," said Veronica Barlow before returning to the corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only taken a few steps when she suddenly stopped. Mason's tiny figure was standing not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you wait for me at the elevator?" Veronica Barlow asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't leave this place. Sis, I'll go wherever you are!" Mason said expressionlessly, but his eyes flickered with determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Veronica Barlow froze. "Did you... hear what I just said to your mommy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Veronica Barlow became a little embarrassed. "But she's your mommy. You gotta move back home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said no, so I won't," he said. He stretched out his little hand and held Veronica Barlow's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Veronica Barlow felt Mason grabbing her hand. She bit her lip and said, "I don't want you to leave either, but... we're only kids..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were only kids, so it was pointless even if they were reluctant, grudging, and unwilling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how her mommy had died. She did not want her daddy and stepmother to move into her mommy's old house, but... it was pointless. All she could do was accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Similarly, she wanted to stay with Mason, but what could she do if aunt Cummins wanted to take Mason home?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was only a kid! There was nothing she could do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't leave. I won&rsquo;t leave even though I&rsquo;m a child," said Mason. His childlike voice sounded so confident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Mason, who was shorter than her, speaking so affirmatively, Veronica Barlow could not help laughing at herself. She was two years older than Mason. Mason was not worried, but she kept feeling worried. She was the elder sister!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, we'll try to stay together no matter what. If we do separate, we can get back together when we grow up." In her opinion, they could do many things when they grew up and became adults.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They did not need to rely on adults and could make their own decisions!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll never separate!" Mason corrected her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just speaking metaphorically, okay? I'm just saying if that were the case..." Veronica Barlow explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then don't speak metaphorically. We won't separate," he said stubbornly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." She did not know what to say suddenly. She could only stare at him. After a while, she burst into laughter. "Alright, we won't separate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In any case, Mason was her most precious brother, and she would be a good sister!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her smile, and a faint smile appeared on his expressionless face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He liked to see Sis smile. He felt content to see Sis' smile!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
