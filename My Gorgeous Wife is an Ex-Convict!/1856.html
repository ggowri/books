        <h1>Chapter 1854</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he interrupted her, "Grace, how much do you love me? Perhaps you don&rsquo;t love me as much as I thought!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At the end of the day, he had only been deceiving himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Since you&rsquo;re kneeling in front of me for this woman, then I&rsquo;ll stop here today. But there&rsquo;s no next time. I won't let this woman off. If you really want to stand against me for this woman, then it means that's all there is to your love for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason turned to leave as soon as he finished speaking, and his bodyguards followed suit. Mrs. Watts collapsed on the ground. Old Lawyer Watts immediately grabbed his wife and asked in a panic, "Are you okay? Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts's face was pale, and her forehead was red after she bled from all the kowtowing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jason hates me. He hates me..." Mrs. Watts did not answer her husband. Instead, she repeatedly said this as tears streamed down her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts helped his wife to her feet. "This isn&rsquo;t something you can resolve overnight. Maybe he&rsquo;ll slowly forgive you in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Forgive?" Mrs. Watts smiled wryly and said, "He won't forgive me. He won't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stepped forward and said, "Let's get out of here first. Mrs. Watts needs to have her wound treated first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts responded. Mrs. Watts looked at Grace with a face full of apologies. "Grace, I'm sorry for making you argue with Jason for me. Don't plead for me anymore. I deserve whatever Jason chooses to do to me! I owe it to him and his father!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Watts, stop talking about this. Let's deal with the injury on your forehead first," Grace said, but she could not stop thinking about Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The disappointment in Jay's eyes when he left just now seemed to have imprinted in her mind as it would not go away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew that she had hurt him badly today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The three walked out of the cemetery, but as soon as they got out, Jason's men stopped them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace took a look around and saw Terrence among them. He said to Old Lawyer Watts and Mrs. Watts, "Sir, Ma&rsquo;am, Young master Reed has arranged accommodation for you. Please come with us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts snapped. "What are you trying to do? Are you going to imprison us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Old Lawyer Watts, calm down. You may leave if you don't want to follow us. But... when your wife left back then, she was guilty of committing murder and intentional injury. Although many years have passed, it has been reported to the police and a record was made. You're a lawyer, you must know the meaning of this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you mean murder and intentional injury?" Old Lawyer Watts snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She murdered Young master Reed's father, of course. Besides, before your wife left, Young master Reed was admitted to the hospital and almost died because of a serious injury. You can check the hospital records for this," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts's tears welled up again when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So, do you want to go to the accommodation that Young master Reed has arranged for you, or should we go straight to the police station?" Terrence asked nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts looked at his wife next to him and said with a sigh, "But I need a doctor to examine my wife first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Someone will help treat her wound," said Terrence as he opened the car door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts helped Mrs. Watts into the car, while Grace asked Terrence, "Where are you taking them?"</p></div>
