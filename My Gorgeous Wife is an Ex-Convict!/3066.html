        <h1>Chapter 3064</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think Valda only wanted to save the child? What she really wanted to save was..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Jason could finish his sentence, Grace interrupted him with a scolding, "Jason, don't say anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason paused and looked at his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pleaded with him, "Jason, please stop. It's our fault, everything is our fault! Valda disappeared because of us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Jasmine in Grace's arms was crying loudly, frightened by the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly comforted her daughter, "Jasmine, don't cry. Uncle Brian didn't mean to scare you just now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Brian and said, "I won't let you lay a finger on Jasmine. If you really want to harm Valda, you can come after me instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fill my destiny?" Brian suddenly laughed, but with that mournful laughter, two lines of clear tears flowed from his reddened phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, he is the one who deserves to be sentenced to death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In fact, I'm the one who should die, it's all my fault! I'm the one who let Valda down! It's me who deserves to die!" Brian shouted, feeling a sharp pain in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, the pain seems to have already enveloped him, even to the point where it's so intense that he feels numb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was never a "most painful" before, only "more painful"!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he was so numb from the pain that he couldn't feel it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now... he feels the pain again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ouch! The pain was so intense that he clenched his fists and repeatedly pounded his chest, saying "It's me, it's all my fault..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, don't do this!" Grace handed the child to Jason, took a quick step forward, and grabbed Brian's hand. "Don't do this. If Valda finds out you're acting like this for her, she'll be hurt and upset."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Feeling sad?" Brian murmured, "But do you know? I've made her feel sad too many times. Why...why was I so foolish before? Why didn't I treat her better when she was by my side? Why did I always make her feel sad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian keeps blaming himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I knew exactly what she wanted to hear from me, didn't I? I knew she had been waiting for me to fall in love with her! She was so eager, but I didn't say anything! I had already fallen in love with her a long time ago, but I foolishly thought I hadn't! Hahaha... Is there anyone in the world more foolish than me? Why, why did she have to fall in love with a fool like me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was crying in pain, his body trembling and curled up like a desperate beast. It seemed that for him, the remaining time was just waiting for death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace couldn't stop crying. In front of her was Brian, and she didn't even know what she could say to help him pull himself together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe... only Valda can do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason beside her, but he just shook his head slightly, his eyes telling her that nothing needed to be said right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because...saying anything now is useless!</p></div>
