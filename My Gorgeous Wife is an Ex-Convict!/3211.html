        <h1>Chapter 3209</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, when Valda woke up, she was already on Brian's private plane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you awake? Do you want to sleep a little longer?" Brian asked Valda, who had just opened her bleary eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Umm..." Valda yawned, still feeling a bit groggy. "Brian...what time is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's 11 o'clock," Brian said, checking the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda suddenly shuddered and sat up abruptly. "It's 11 o'clock? Then the boarding time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm already on the plane," Brian said. "Didn't you notice?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blinked and didn't react at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a few seconds, she looked around and was stunned. "This is...the plane?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When did I get on the plane? I was clearly..." she stammered, feeling a bit disoriented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the morning, I saw that you were sleeping soundly, so I didn't wake you up and just carried you onto the plane," Brian explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt like she couldn't breathe. Oh my god, so he carried her out of the villa, and then...carried her into the airport and onto the plane?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if they were on a private plane now, many people must have seen him carrying her into the airport and onto the plane. What did she look like then? Did she drool or talk in her sleep?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about this, Valda suddenly wanted to find a hole to bury herself in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if he could read her mind, Brian said, "Don't worry, no one saw your face. I wrapped you in a blanket when I carried you, and your face was almost buried in the blanket. Others shouldn't have seen what you look like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Valda was skeptical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, why would I lie to you?" Brian asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed plausible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda finally relaxed a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, are you hungry? Wash up first, there's a meal prepared on the plane. Once you're done, you can eat," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh," she replied and went to the restroom on the plane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were plenty of toiletries available.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She freshened up and combed her hair, finally looking less disheveled than when she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her gaze fell on the top button of her clothes. She had left two buttons undone, revealing her collarbone and the skin around it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And on that pristine skin were some red marks... from last night...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about last night's scene, Valda's face flushed again. She quickly buttoned up her clothes tightly and then left the restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the table inside the cabin, the meal has already been set up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda sat down and realized that she was truly hungry, so she began to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How much longer until we reach our destination?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian checked the time and said, "We'll be there in 40 minutes. Just grab a little something to eat to hold you over. Once we get off the car, I'll take you to try some local delicacies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh," she responded, feeling sweet and happy inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While eating, she watched Brian sitting next to her flipping through a travel brochure that introduced the destinations they were going to visit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Brian, and saw the wedding ring on his hand. This man was really her husband now. From now on, they would be together forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" He seemed to notice her gaze and turned his head to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... It's nothing." She smiled awkwardly. "I just think you're really handsome."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are also very beautiful, Mrs. Hart," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she heard the three words "Mrs. Hart", the sweet feeling in her heart became even stronger, almost overflowing with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, she is Mrs. Hart now, she is his wife!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After getting off the plane, Valda turned on her phone again and saw several messages from Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She opened it up and saw her friend saying, "I said Valda, congratulations on making the hot search again." There was also a screenshot.</p></div>
