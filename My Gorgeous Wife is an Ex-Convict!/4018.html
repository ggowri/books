        <h1>Chapter 4016</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, I know I've done some wrong things, and it may be difficult for you to forgive me, but...I beg you, don't cut ties with me like this," Mick knelt down in front of her hospital bed and pleaded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was low and filled with indescribable pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Nancy suddenly felt a sense of absurdity, as if their roles had been reversed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, she had begged him for forgiveness, but now, he was begging her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it because you think I jumped off the cliff and saved Jasper that you're doing this?" Nancy whispered, looking at him. "Mick, you don't have to do this. Regardless of whether I jumped or not, we would have both fallen off the cliff in the end. The only difference is whether I did it voluntarily or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face suddenly changed. "Do you really think I wouldn't have chosen you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled bitterly. "In that situation, anyone would have chosen Jasper. Even Irene had already chosen Jasper. Only when Jasper was taken hostage did she have a chance of safety. If Jasper fell into the sea, Irene would have had no cards left to play."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because she was just an insignificant little person, she had seen this clearly from the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So you jumped into the sea by yourself? Have you ever thought about what this means for me...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I did it for the Reed family, for you," Nancy said. If Mick were to make the choice, he would inevitably feel guilty and self-blame towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had tasted this feeling before and didn't want him to experience it too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think this is good?" Mick said harshly. "Is this what you call repayment? I never needed you to repay me in this way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's eyes dimmed. Even if she wanted to repay Mick with her life, it was unnecessary for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was all just her own wishful thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry, I was being presumptuous," she said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sense of inexplicable annoyance enveloped him. "Damn it, I don't want you to apologize. I just don't want to see you not valuing your life, Nancy, your life is important! Please don't make me worry and be afraid again, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even during this time, he would often dream of her resolutely jumping down at midnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then he would wake up in a cold sweat, unable to tell if it was sweat or tears on his face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at Mick in surprise. "I...I don't understand what you mean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She understood every word, but the combination of words made her feel like she didn't understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It couldn't be what she thought it was. Maybe it was just Mick's gratitude for her pulling Irene and saving Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or maybe it was because he felt guilty for her injury?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or maybe there was another meaning?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't understand? Then let me make it clearer," he raised his hand and gently held hers. "Nancy, I love you. I don't need you to repay me, I just want you to be safe and live well! Do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was completely stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Falling in love... Mick fell in love with her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How is that possible?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He used to despise her so much!</p></div>
