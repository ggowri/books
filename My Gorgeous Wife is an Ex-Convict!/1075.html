        <h1>Chapter 1074</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He muttered, "Yeah, we&rsquo;ve broken up. Breaking up with you is the thing I regret the most, so I won't let myself regret it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to love him again and to love him so much that she could not leave him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat on the couch in her room at night and looked at the purple floral gown in her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The gown was torn from the neckline to one side of the sleeves. Even after mending, it would never be the same again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little upset seeing what was once a perfect gown turning out like this. After all, it was something that Bryn gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Brian did not know it was her and even if Brian did not mean to give her the gown, it was like a series of coincidences that made all the promises they made when they were little come true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Biting her lip a little, Grace got up and went to a nearby cupboard where she took out a sewing box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had taken a closer look around the room when she was free today and accidentally saw this sewing box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sewing box looked quite old. It contained a few needles and an ancient but delicate thimble. Although some of the silk thread inside had faded, they were still sturdy and would not break in one pull.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was this sewing box left by someone who lived in the room before? It's probably a woman because the thimble is about the same size as my finger.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was not used to wearing a thimble, especially since her knuckles were slightly deformed. It only added to the inconvenience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a small ball of purple thread, took another needle, and began to mend the gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the gown was torn and could no longer be worn, it was still a childhood promise and a gift. She did not want to let the gown stay torn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stitch by stitch, Grace carefully fixed it. She would carefully think about every stitch as if she was mending their childhood promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door was pushed open and Jason walked in. His deep eyes instantly narrowed when he saw the gown she was mending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Didn't you say you don&rsquo;t love Brian? Why would you mend the gown he gave you?" he asked with obvious jealousy in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had also mended his clothes under the lights back in the small rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she was mending the gown Brian gave her. 'What is she thinking? Is she thinking of Brian?' He felt a pang in his chest at the thought of it. It was as if something was stuck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a gown," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't even tolerate a gown." He bent down and stared at her. "Grace, you and Brian are not meant to be. Otherwise, you wouldn't have forgotten him for so many years and he would not have mistaken your cousin for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her expression changed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled lightly and said, "Tell me, Brian keeps saying that he misses you, but he mistook you for someone else. How much does he really miss you, then? He can give the gown to you today and another gown to Stella another day, no?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was something playful and sarcastic in his smile. It was as if he was telling her that the gown in her hand did not mean anything.</p></div>
