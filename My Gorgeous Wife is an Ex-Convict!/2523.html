        <h1>Chapter 2521</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They thought their daughter hurt herself when she had a mental breakdown!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell only stated she knew nothing about it. She always thought her sister was ill, so she often visited Amber Mitchell in the hospital. During those times, Amber Mitchell had behaved like a real mental patient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All in all, the case was indeed as tough as Lawyer Gan said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if the final chain of evidence could prove that the Mitchell family committed bribery and that Amber Mitchell was abused in the hospital, Louise Mitchell could still get acquitted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trial lasted three days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the third day of the trial, the judge sentenced Mr. Mitchell and Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s stepmother to three years in prison, while Louise Mitchell was acquitted on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's face instantly burst into a smirk. Sure enough, she was not found guilty in the end! George Gregory still had some tricks up his sleeve!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She still emerged as the winner!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Gan, who was at Amber Mitchell's side, consoled Amber Mitchell by saying, "In any case, at least two people have been sentenced now. As for Louise Mitchell, we can sue her again if we find new evidence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell replied in acknowledgment, but she knew that George Gregory must have made full preparations since he was helping Louise Mitchell with the lawsuit this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her father and stepmother took all the blame to &lsquo;clear&rsquo; Louise Mitchell's name. She could tell that her father and stepmother had also bet all their hopes on Louise Mitchell, believing they would be released from prison sooner as long as Amber Mitchell was safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything that the Mitchell family owned could also be preserved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the trial ended, Louise Mitchell came over from the defendant's table, looked smugly at Amber Mitchell, and said in a voice that only they could hear, "What a pity, Sis. You couldn&rsquo;t get what you wished for. Even the law has proven I'm innocent. Maybe you need to find another way to send me to jail, Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked at her coldly. "You know full well whether you're innocent or not, Louise Mitchell. You can escape once but not twice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? Let's see whether it&rsquo;ll be you or me who will suffer, Sis." Louise Mitchell smiled faintly before turning around and walking to George Gregory's side. She took George Gregory's arm affectionately, looking like a loving couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory glanced indifferently at Louise Mitchell but did not reject her intimacy in front of everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was instantly smugger as she gently pressed her face to George Gregory's arm. "George, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory then walked out of the court with Louise Mitchell, but his eyes still glanced at Amber Mitchell when they left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even he could not explain it. The outcome of the case was exactly as he had expected, but he felt no joy at all. Instead, he felt guilty as if he had committed a crime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather, he had indeed committed a crime. He knew who was responsible for making Amber Mitchell a mental patient, but he was still trying to exonerate and save that person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When George Gregory and Louise Mitchell walked out of the courtroom, a crowd of reporters instantly surrounded them and bombarded them with questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell pretended to look sad. "I'm sad. Both parties are my family. I think my father and mother might have other reasons for what they did to Sis. But for what it's worth, I believe that the law is fair. Since Mom and Dad did Sis wrong, they should be punished by the law."</p></div>
