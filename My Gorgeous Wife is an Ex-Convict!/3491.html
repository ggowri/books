        <h1>Chapter 3489</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you find your way here?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hesitating for a moment, Mason said, "I just stumbled upon some clues and decided to follow them. I'm sure it won't be long before my people and the police arrive here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't tell her that he had installed a tracking device in her necklace, it was an instinct that made him avoid telling her the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Veronica murmured. Perhaps due to her previously high-strung nerves, she now felt completely exhausted. "I don't even know how Lionel is doing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's okay now. When I went into the warehouse earlier, I fought the person who was guarding him. He only got a few hits and wasn't seriously injured," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is he really involved in this kidnapping?" When she and Jasper woke up earlier, the person guarding them said that it was planned by his own brother Lionel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And at that time, it was indeed Lionel who led them to the private room and even caused them to faint!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everything will be thoroughly investigated by the police," said Mason. "Veronica, I'm glad you're okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Jasper, she doesn't know how she is now," Veronica said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper should be fine. I ran into her on my way here. She will find a safe place and wait for the Reed family and the police to arrive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so? That's good then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica finally feels a bit relieved at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He carried her on his back, taking each step steadily. She realized that the boy she used to protect had grown broad shoulders, and being carried by him felt so secure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the two arrived at the foot of the mountain, Veronica only saw several cars parked not far away, including police cars. Some police officers rushed towards them upon seeing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Are they safe now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica thought this and at that moment, her body completely relaxed as if she couldn't hold on any longer, and she fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt like she had just woken up from a very long dream. In the dream, she was constantly running in a dark and endless space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know where she was running to or where the finish line was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She just kept running, wanting to escape the constant sound of footsteps behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, her feet seemed to trip on something and she fell hard to the ground, with someone pinning her down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A feeling of fear spread through her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No...no..." she shouted desperately, trying to push the person off of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her hands were grabbed and a voice whispered in her ear - "Veronica...Veronica..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ahh!" Veronica suddenly opened her eyes to a bright room and a familiar face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was...Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at him in shock before realizing that she had just had a nightmare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, did you have a terrible dream?" Mason asked, tightly holding her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica took a deep breath and said, "I had a dream... I was so scared that I kept running."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't be afraid," he said, lifting his hand to gently wipe away the tears that had welled up in the corners of her eyes. "Everything is okay now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... what about the kidnappers?" she asked urgently.</p></div>
