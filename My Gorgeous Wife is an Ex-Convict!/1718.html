        <h1>Chapter 1716</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She instantly paused and turned around, only to see Hadwin Stephenson standing ten meters away! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He's... still here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was dumbfounded. Then, she saw Hadwin Stephenson approaching her step by step. "Are you looking for me?" he repeated the question earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina finally came to her senses, took a deep breath, and said, "Yes! Did you hurt yourself when you fell down the escalator today? Where did you hurt yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His dark eyes gazed at her before a sarcastic smile appeared on the corners of his lips. "Are you worried about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what if I am? Why are you here at this hour when you&rsquo;re injured instead of resting at home?&rdquo; How long would he have stood there if she had not opened the window?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her heart could not help but tremble at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He chuckled as his lashes drooped a little. "Would it move you if I said I came here because I wanted to see you? Will you be moved enough to get back together with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, I&rsquo;m serious!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"And who are you to say I'm not serious?" he retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She froze and looked at him in silence, her hands by her sides gripping the hem of her pajamas. "I... won't get back together with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had no idea if he would abandon her again for ambition, money, and power if the Stephenson family had another crisis!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that time, maybe not only her but her parents would also suffer a harder blow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore... even though she still had feelings for him, she dared not take a chance again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... "I'm very grateful to you for saving my life today. If it hadn't been for you, I would've been the one injured. I might have even ended up in a hospital. But..." She bit her lip before mustering the courage to say, "Hadwin Stephenson, you don't have to save me again next time. Since we have nothing to do with each other anymore, you don't need to keep saving me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes froze, and the look of sarcasm in his gaze grew thicker!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Are you afraid you'll keep owing me and it&rsquo;ll be impossible for you to get away from me?" His piercing eyes seemed to see right through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina stiffened, only to hear him continue saying, "So what if you continue to owe me more and more? Will it make it difficult for you to be with Anthony Sherman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her heart quivered. 'He thinks that... Anthony Sherman and I...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Well, people will easily misunderstand it if I don't make it clear.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, believe it or not, you'll keep owing me..." His voice sounded so clear at night. "...unless you marry another man and become his wife one day. In that case, I'll disappear and never meet you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina seemed startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He spoke with such determination that she felt as though there was a sharp sword mercilessly stabbing her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Pain burst out of her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She thought that they would no longer be involved with each other but did not think that they would not even see each other again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had even imagined countless times that they might meet by chance on the streets and smile at each other when they were old, looking back at their past sufferings as pleasant memories.</p></div>
