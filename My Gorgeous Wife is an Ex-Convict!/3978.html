        <h1>Chapter 3976</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only have two sisters, Jasper and Jasmine. As for you, you left the Reed family a long time ago and have no connection to it whatsoever!" Mick said with disgust in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This disgust deeply hurt Irene. "Why do you treat me like this? You can like someone like Nancy, why can't you like me? You used to treat me differently--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene's voice suddenly stopped because Mick's hand was now choking her neck. "Shut up. Don't mention that name in front of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene suddenly found it difficult to breathe, but she still managed to say, "Why...can't even that name be mentioned? She used you like that, and you let her go. But me...everything my mother did to the Reed family had nothing to do with me. Why do you hate me too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her mother had been smarter in her actions, Irene would still be living a life of luxury as a rich young lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she was living a miserable life of poverty after leaving the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So many times, Irene hated the Reed family, but she hated her own mother even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Irene, you better shut up. I don't want to hear anyone mention that name or anything related to it in front of me again. If you keep making the same mistake, don't blame me for banning you from ever setting foot in Emerald City again!" Mick threatened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more he made these threats, the deeper Irene's jealousy grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her impression, Mick was always indifferent to everything, as if nothing could catch his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, because of that despicable woman Nancy, he kept saying harsh words. This only meant that Nancy still had a place in his heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me a...a chance, please. Let me prove that my feelings for you...won't be used for any gain!" Irene pleaded desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After so many years, she finally had the chance to get close to him again. She couldn't give up now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't have any chance, and I don't want to hear any more of your nonsense. Get lost!" Mick shook off her hand forcefully, causing Irene to stumble and almost fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick turned his head towards the corner where Nancy was hiding. "Who's there? Come out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy walked out of the shadowy corner with an embarrassed expression. She had purposely hidden there to avoid an awkward encounter with Mick and Irene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the situation had become even more awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nancy emerged, Irene's face turned incredibly ugly. Not long ago, she had just insulted Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Nancy had witnessed Irene's pitiful scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene left in a hurry without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only Nancy and Mick were left in the hallway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy stood frozen in place, her mind once again becoming blank. Her throat, which was already dry, seemed even thirstier!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why...did she have to run into Mick here again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even afraid of meeting him, afraid of seeing that coldness in his eyes once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she faced his coldness and disgust, it only made her feel more pain.</span></p></div>
