        <h1>Chapter 3857</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people even revealed that Veronica had moved out of the Barlow family four years ago and had been living alone in a small apartment left by her biological mother. Over the past few years, she had been working hard to pay for her tuition and living expenses while studying and doing part-time jobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In contrast, the rest of the Barlow family had been going in and out of high-end places, buying various luxury brands. On Lionel's birthday, Archer and Rosalind's son, they even rented out an entire nightclub and spent millions of dollars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These pieces of negative information kept being exposed online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, the direction of public opinion gradually began to reverse. Many people believed that the Barlow family was simply sucking the blood of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was bad enough that they were sucking blood, but they were also damaging the reputation of the Reed family. Cutting off ties with Veronica and the Barlow family was indeed the right decision. It was really unlucky to have such family members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a while, the Barlow family became the target of public criticism.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, the Reed family didn't have any negative news. After all, in the eyes of ordinary people, there was no need to maintain such a relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people even applauded the Reed family online, saying that such in-laws should not be indulged. Otherwise, if this kind of parasite is allowed to continue, the entire Reed family may be dragged down in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at the reversed public opinion online and finally confirmed that things didn't develop in the terrible direction she had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now you can rest assured," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think my father and stepmother will be willing to live like this?" Veronica still felt uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After this incident, they won't be able to cause any more trouble. In the future, no one will dare to lend them money. If they don't want to have a miserable future, the best way is to live a down-to-earth life," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica couldn't imagine what it would be like for her father and stepmother to live a down-to-earth life, but her half-brother was still young. Because of her father and stepmother's behavior, he ended up like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If her brother could really work hard and succeed in the future, she would still be willing to help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, don't think too much about it. The trial will start in a few days, and there will probably be many reporters surrounding us again. During this time, don't go to school. Wait until the storm passes," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Veronica obediently agreed. She knew that she had become a hot topic now, and if she appeared in public, she would be surrounded by people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the Reed family was big enough. Even if she stayed in the Reed family, she wouldn't feel bored. There was a dedicated cinema, entertainment room, study, and so on in the Reed family mansion...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In addition, Grace took the time to explain to Veronica some things to pay attention to in court, as well as how to answer questions briefly and avoid falling into some traps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, the fact that Daniel committed a crime is already very clear, and the chain of evidence is sufficient. You just need to answer truthfully, and don't worry too much about anything else," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What sentence will Daniel receive?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Most likely, he will receive a life sentence, and there is a small chance he will receive the death penalty," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Death penalty?" The moment these two words entered Veronica's ears, her body trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can't bear to hear it?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica shook her head. "Not really. If it weren't for Mason risking his life to save me, I would have died long ago. Daniel not only wanted my life, but also Mason's. I don't feel any sympathy for him. It's just that hearing about the death penalty gives me a strange feeling."</p></div>
