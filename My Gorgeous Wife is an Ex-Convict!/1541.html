        <h1>Chapter 1539</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm your older sister. Look, Daddy called Mommy 'Sis' just now!" Jasper corrected him with a mumble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was sweating profusely. Jason calling her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; had nothing to do with their birth order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">While Grace was having a headache over who was the older sibling between the two kids, Dr. Guzman was giving Jason a check-up in the other room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After determining the severity of Jason's previous headaches and the timing of the onset, Dr. Guzman said, "It must have stimulated some parts of your past. As you said, it's because... your wife said something that reminded you of a similar conversation in the past."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he said this, Dr. Guzman's heart was in a flutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had been dumbfounded for a while when Jason told him that the woman in the living room was his &lsquo;dead&rsquo; wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Young master Reed's wife isn't dead? I can imagine what turmoil Emerald City will be in if the public learns about this news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Young master Reed's wife... will be the most respectable woman in Emerald City. Those socialites who still had ideas for Young master Reed will probably be heartbroken.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"In other words, if she says anything similar again, I might be triggered and get a headache like today?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Guzman said, "That's the idea. You got a headache because you were recalling some memories of yourself and your wife. Now that Mrs. Reed is back, it's naturally easier to trigger those memories."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So it's possible that I can recover my memories?" Jason asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's possible, but..." Dr. Guzman hesitated a little, pausing when he had something to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But it's painful to recover your memories this way. You&rsquo;ll suffer a severe headache when some images recur to you after being triggered. If you keep getting triggered, the pain will worsen and no one knows how much it&rsquo;ll hurt," said Dr. Guzman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, everyone had a different constitution. The way one recovered memories was different as well. Some people might immediately recall them without too much pain after being triggered, while others might experience the opposite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Guzman referred to his previous cases and speculated that Jason was probably the least likely type to recover his memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would often recall some snippets of the past or some conversations they had in the past. Then, he would suffer a headache as if these memories were suppressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason gently looked down. 'Pain... If I want to recover my memories, how much will it hurt?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He used to not care about these lost memories. In his opinion, since he lost those memories, it meant they did not matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... he now had an impulse to restore his memories. He wanted to know about the scenes that flashed across his mind and find out what kind of past he had shared with that woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Reed, how about I give you some of the medicine you used to take to calm you down and ease the trigger if you have another headache?" asked Dr. Guzman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said lightly, "Ease the trigger... Does that also prevent me from recovering my memories?&rdquo;</p></div>
