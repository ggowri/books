        <h1>Chapter 1041</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up into those dark phoenix eyes. The outer corners of those deep, narrow phoenix eyes turned slightly upward. It seemed those eyes could easily seduce people when they were focused on someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow Grace's nose felt a bit sore. Maybe because he was Bryn, or maybe because he was suffering the pain with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to endure the pain alone, but she had someone to suffer with her this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't be so nice to me, Brian. It's not worth it," she murmured. 'I can't afford your kindness.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "It's not for you to decide whether it's worth it or not. It's for me to decide. I think it's worth it even if it hurts!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at him blankly, and for a moment, it was as if something passed through her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After sending Grace back to her place and watching her disappear from his sight, Brian looked down at the bandage on his right forearm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace..." he murmured her name. His lips gently kissed the bandage as if with endless affections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never expected to be so attracted to a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even wanted to cherish the pain she gave him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you love me?" he asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always been good with women. He could have any women he wanted except for her, who left him in doubt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I want her to love me and be with me forever.' The idea was growing stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian restarted the car and drove off slowly, though he still glanced in the rear-view mirror with a faint glimmer of coldness in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian's car finally pulled away, the two men in a nearby black sedan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Reed had ordered them to protect Miss Cummins in secret. Naturally, they had been following Miss Cummins and the crown prince, secretly taking some photos to report to Mr. Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they kept feeling that they had been discovered several times during their stalking today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Finally, we don't have to follow the crown prince anymore," one of them muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it seems the crown prince's more discerning than we imagined. However, is it alright to send those photos to Master Reed?" said the other one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It should be... fine. We're just following Master Reed's instructions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's true." They looked at each other and said no more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the Reed Group's board meeting, everyone heard the president's phone ringing. After the president looked at his phone, his face immediately darkened and the atmosphere in the conference room fell to the freezing point. In an instant, the air was filled with tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The senior executives in the meeting could not help looking at Terrence who was sitting next to the president. They were hoping that Secretary Jackson could give some hints.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, they saw Secretary Gao's expression changing as well. There seemed to be a touch of worry and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People began to wonder what the president had seen on his phone. 'Did one of the company's businesses mess up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I haven't heard of anything yet!'</p></div>
