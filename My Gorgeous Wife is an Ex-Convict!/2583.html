        <h1>Chapter 2581</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What... What she wanted was him, the Martin Weiss who loved her deeply!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, maybe she would never see Martin Weiss again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is he&hellip; Is Martin Weiss okay?" Kyla could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lawyer hesitated slightly before saying, "Mr. Weiss's doing okay and is still busy with his work as before." It was not the case. However, Mr. Weiss had told them to say that everything was fine if Kyla did ask about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Kyla murmured and looked at the divorce papers before finally saying, "I'd like to amend the divorce papers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, go ahead," the lawyer replied quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I accept the shares and child support he wishes to give the children, but I don't need any alimony. He doesn't need to give me any properties either. As for the matter of child support, open two bank accounts and deposit the money there. I'll only withdraw what I need every month. The children can manage the extra money themselves in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lawyer froze, not expecting Kyla to make such suggestions. 'She's simply rejecting the money! What normal person would do that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The alimony and the properties are Mr. Weiss's generosity. You don't have to reject them," the lawyer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I married Martin Weiss. He owes me nothing, so there's no need to give me these. I have no reason to take the alimony and properties. Please convey that to him for me. I have no opinion on the rest," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A-Alright then. Hold on," the lawyer said before turning around to enter another room. They called Martin Weiss and told him about Kyla's requests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person on the other end of the line was silent for a long time before saying, "If she thinks it's a good idea, let's do it her way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, Mr. Weiss," replied the lawyer before returning to Kyla and saying, "Miss Corbyn, Mr. Weiss said the agreement can be revised according to your wishes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took a deep breath and said, "Okay, revise the contract, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla walked out of the law firm, she seemed to be in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked down blankly at her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How did that happen? The agreement had been amended as she wanted, but she still hesitated when the lawyer asked her to sign it. Her hand that held the pen would not land on the paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, she could only say to the lawyer, "I... want to go back and think about it. I'll contact you after thinking it through."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, you can think about it. I'm sure Mr. Weiss will do his best to satisfy whatever requests you have," the lawyer said respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the statement did not make her happy at all.</p></div>
