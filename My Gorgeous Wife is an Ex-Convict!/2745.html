        <h1>Chapter 2743</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression changed suddenly. "What do you mean by that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said ruthlessly, "You rushed over and blamed her as soon as you found out something had happened to Grace. Anyone can tell that you don't love her! Kyla and I could tell. Do you want Grace to tell that too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stiffened instantly. "Jason, what do you know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "I don't know anything, but I can guess, can't I? We both want what's best for Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression turned furious suddenly. "If you want what's best for Grace, why did you get her pregnant? You know she almost died giving birth to the triplets! Why did you put her in this position?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Remorse flashed across Jason's face. Then, he stared at Brian and said, "It's indeed my fault, so I&rsquo;ll live and die with Grace! If she can't survive this, I'll die with her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Brian's eyes flashed with shock, but then it became clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yeah, he would have done the same if it were him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said coldly, "Grace isn't doing well. She can't have mood swings and will have to stay in bed until she gives birth. Brian, since you started this and let Grace know that you already have a lover, you should keep doing it to the end! I don't want Grace to have another mood swing because of you and get in danger again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long silence, Brian finally murmured, "I want to see Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, but she's asleep right now. Don't wake her." Jason turned around and walked toward the ward after saying that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After entering the ward, Brian looked at Grace who was sleeping on the hospital bed. His eyes watered slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked pale and fragile as she slept. The time before she gave birth was the most worrying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had another mood swing, it could put her and the baby at risk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would hate to see her in any danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If his feelings put her in danger, then... he was willing to get rid of them. He would do anything for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope you won't let Grace know what's going on between you and Valda Theller. Even if it's a lie, at least don't let shatter it in front of her!" Jason's voice rang in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyelashes quivered slightly as he gazed at the person lying on the bed. Moments later, he said, "I know what to do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller ran out of the hospital. When she got on the bus, tears could not help gushing out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect herself to cry like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She frantically wiped the tears from her face, desperately trying to stop them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's there to cry about? I already knew Brian cares for and loves Grace. It's natural for him to blurt out such things!'</p></div>
