        <h1>Chapter 1390</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, he had not even dared to take a second glance. He felt as if he had committed a betrayal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, who had he betrayed? He and Paisley were getting married soon, so it was nothing even if they did have sex.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, he and Paisley had shared a bed before Kyla Corbyn went to prison. However, after Kyla Corbyn went to prison, he somehow became more accustomed to sleeping alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he and Paisley were a couple and were even about to get married, he would feel guilty whenever he did something intimate with Paisley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even he could not explain the reason why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because of Kyla Corbyn? But who is Kyla Corbyn to affect me like this? Since I could testify against her in court, it means that I never loved her at all!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could this happen? My poor child!" Mrs. Daniels was already lying beside Paisley Daniels and crying her eyes out. "How can Kyla Corbyn be so ruthless? Hurting you once wasn't enough and she&rsquo;s hurt you a second time now. Two babies! Two lives!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, stop... Stop it..." Paisley Daniels, who was already pale after her surgery, looked even more pitiful as she burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was already difficult for you to conceive after the miscarriage last time. Now that you've finally managed to get pregnant, Kyla Corbyn ruined it again! She did it on purpose! She's afraid that her son won't be able to inherit the Weiss family if you're pregnant. That's why she did this to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss trembled a little and seemed to say in disbelief, "Kyla Corbyn... also knows about Paisley's pregnancy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley told Nelson... that he&rsquo;ll have a baby brother or sister soon. Paisley was kind enough to bring Nelson to see us today, wanting us to treat both children equally in the future. Who knew... Kyla Corbyn would deliberately push Paisley..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Daniels cursed Kyla Corbyn with such hatred that it was almost as if she wanted to eat her alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Daniels also said with a look of grief, "Martin, Paisley tolerated everything for you. Kyla Corbyn previously caused her to lose her baby and hurt her health. When Paisley finally got pregnant again, this happened. She'll probably never have another baby. Kyla Corbyn has cost the Daniels family and the Weiss family two children. We can't let her off so easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened, and his gaze fell on Paisley Daniels who was still crying and blaming herself. Mr. Daniels's voice continued to ring in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley has been kind to you. You can't let Kyla Corbyn off just because she's Nelson's birth mother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know. I'll give Paisley an explanation no matter what," Martin Weiss said in a deep voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Paisley is... the woman I've sworn to protect all my life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had saved his life by donating her bone marrow to a stranger like him without asking for anything in return! He had only survived because of her, and it gave him a chance to revive the Weiss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not be what he was today without Paisley!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Paisley was hurt again and again because of Kyla Corbyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been too kind to Kyla Corbyn, causing Paisley harm! If he had been more merciless to Kyla Corbyn, this kind of thing would not have happened!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
