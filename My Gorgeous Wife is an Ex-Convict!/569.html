        <h1>Chapter 568</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She did not expect today's guest to be Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Roadshows sometimes invited guests to the event as a surprise for the audience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they usually invited big names, and Evelyn was only a D-list actress in the entertainment industry before she became Brian's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her popularity was all due to Brian. During this time, Evelyn had gotten a lot of good resources because of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, aside from a few published commercials, other TV dramas and singles were still in production and had yet to be released.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Evelyn had not starred in any real films. To put it bluntly, the reason she could be the guest was because of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina turned to her best friend with a look of embarrassment and apology on her face. "Sorry, Grace. I didn't know that Evelyn would be the guest today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had known, she would not have bought tickets for this roadshow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. "What&rsquo;s there to be sorry for? It's none of your business. Besides, we came to see Howell Webb today, not Evelyn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina still could not get over it, so much so that she did not pay much attention to the film when it started playing. She was still thinking about Evelyn being the guest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the end of the movie, Lina did not urge Grace to help her find Howell Webb for a photo. Instead, she said, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't want a photo with him?" asked Grace in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll tell you later." Lina shrugged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on, let's try it out." Grace knew how much her best friend had been looking forward to getting a photo and autograph today. She did not want to let her down because of Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she called Jason on the phone, "Can you get Howell Webb's contact information for me, Jay? Or his manager's contact information? I'm now with Lina, and I want to find Howell Webb for a photo again. It won't keep him too long... Um, all right. I see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace ended the call, she looked up and saw her best friend's eager eyes. She smiled and said, "All right, Jason said he&rsquo;ll get in touch with them and ask them to contact me, so I just have to wait for their call."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wow, that's great!" Lina was shocked. At first, she just wanted to take a chance. She also thought that maybe she and Grace could not get near Howell Webb at all. After all, there were so many fans here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect a shortcut like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Grace's phone rang, and it was Howell Webb himself who called. After asking for her exact location, he said he would send someone to take them to the lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"God, I'm going to faint!" After Grace ended the call, Lina said with a dramatic expression, "Howell Webb called you! Do you have Howell Webb's personal contact information now? Do you know how many people want Howell Webb's phone number?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a bit confused. "Maybe later when you see Howell Webb, you can ask if he&rsquo;ll give you his phone number too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'd love to, but..." Hadwin's warning earlier flashed in Lina's mind. Then, she trembled and said, "I'd better not."</p></div>
