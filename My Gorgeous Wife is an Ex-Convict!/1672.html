        <h1>Chapter 1670</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Looked on coldly... I looked on coldly for the Reed family too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She doesn&rsquo;t forgive Sean but... she forgives me? Has she really forgiven me, or... is it fake? Is it just because she hasn't gotten her memory back, so she has no idea?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason suddenly dared not think about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a pause, Grace said, "Sean saved my life this time. I'll thank him and repay him, but that's all. It would be the same if a stranger had saved me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What about me? Will you... feel sorry for me and care about me?" His hoarse voice escaped his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked at him, a little amused. "Why do you ask? You're my husband. I love you and care about you, but sympathy... Isn't that inappropriate? Are you comparing yourself to Sean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She took his cheeks in her hands as she spoke. "Jay, I&rsquo;ll never hold Sean in my heart. He's just part of my past and doesn't mean anything else. You're the person I care about the most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, her lips pressed hard against his. The tip of her tongue gently pried open his mouth and entered, wrapping itself around his tongue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Their saliva and breathing... fused and merged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wanted to tell him just how much she loved him! She wanted him to feel assured and not be uneasy or scared like five years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, I love you. I love you no matter what happens in the future!" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, I just want you to love me forever!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And... never leave me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the third day, Grace went to the procuratorate and answered a series of questions, including questions about her relationship with her mentor&mdash;Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace answered honestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as the questioning was almost over, one of the female staff members suddenly said, "Lawyer Cummins, as far as I know, you&rsquo;ve had an impressive law career in L City in the past two years. Many of your connections were introduced by Lawyer Kang Milo. You even moved into Lawyer Kang's apartment for a while. Is there anything else going on in the relationship between both of you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace narrowed her eyes and stared at her. The staff was about her age, in her early 30s. She wore a gray business suit and had an average-looking face that seemed a little hostile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace glanced at the badge on her chest... Li Peiyuan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Prosecutor Li, your question is out of line. You can only ask me questions relevant to the case, not personal questions about my mentor and me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But Damian Harmon reported that you have an illicit relationship with your mentor, so he deliberately lost the lawsuit. Shouldn't you explain your relationship with your mentor?" she said hostilely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I've already told you everything I need to say about my relationship with my mentor. I don't have to tell you anything irrelevant unless you can prove what you're asking is relevant to the lawsuit and it&rsquo;s going to constitute a complete chain of evidence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You... Grace, you're being questioned right now!" roared Li Peiyuan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But I'm not a prisoner! Prosecutor Li, I can bring this up to your supervisor if you continue to make things difficult," Grace said calmly.</p></div>
