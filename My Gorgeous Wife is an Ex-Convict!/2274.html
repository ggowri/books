        <h1>Chapter 2272</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked up to the French window and looked at Martin Weiss on the operating table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From her point of view, he was surrounded by doctors and nurses in the distance. All she could see was his profile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were closed, and some of his hair had been shaved off. His pale face was so obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a terrible fear that he would continue sleeping and never open his eyes again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, don't worry. Nothing will happen." Grace gently pat Kyla on the shoulder and said, "There are many experts here, and Martin Weiss has always been in good health."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla replied in acknowledgment as she continued to stare at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After about ten minutes, a voice suddenly came from the surgery room. "The patient has lost a lot of blood and needs more blood, but his blood type is rare. There&rsquo;s no such blood type in the hospital's blood bank, so we need to go to tMason Swansonty's blood bank to get it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can take my blood. I have the same blood type as him!" Kyla spoke almost without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said quickly, "Kyla, you're pregnant. How could they draw your blood? Even if you're willing, no doctor will dare to do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. She just realized that she was pregnant and could not give Martin Weiss her blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gave his life today to save her, yet she could not do anything for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace also said, "Kyla, don't panic. They'll get it from the blood bank immediately."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason contacted Emerald City's blood bank, but moments later, he frowned slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The blood bank only has 400ml of this rare blood type in stock, which is not enough," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly seemed to recall something. "There should be blood in Municipal Women's Hospital. It's Martin Weiss's own blood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Municipal Women's Hospital?" Grace froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had no time to explain. She only said to Jason, "Please contact Municipal Women's Hospital and ask them to send the blood Martin Weiss stored there previously!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason then asked his staff to contact Municipal Women's Hospital. Moments later, the reply they got was that Martin Weiss had 1,000ml of blood stored in Municipal Women's Hospital. The blood was on its way now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was relieved to hear the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace and Lina had many doubts, it was inappropriate to ask about it in the current situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's surgery lasted for three hours. When Martin Weiss was wheeled out of the surgery room, he was still in a coma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla insisted on accompanying Martin Weiss to the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's ward was next to hers, and the two wards seemed to have been deliberately arranged this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, the doctor said Martin Weiss's wounds are a little serious, but he&rsquo;s not in any danger and the injuries are nothing serious. They've given him a blood transfusion for his blood loss. He should wake up in a minute, so why don't you get some rest too? Martin Weiss has caretakers and nurses looking after him." Grace tried to advise Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head. "I'd like to stay here for a while. Why don't you go home first? Thank you for today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you..." Grace said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My mother will be here with Nelson later. Besides, you said there are caretakers and nurses here, so I'm just going to sit here," said Kyla. As if afraid that her best friend would worry, she added, "I won't exhaust myself and disregard the baby in my belly!"</p></div>
