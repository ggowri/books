        <h1>Chapter 953</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Grace looked at Curtis Row with a headache. Curtis Row was a different person from the man she faced that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins, just take it. It was my fault that day. I shouldn't have ignored you and left you standing there for so long. I've been meaning to come and apologize to you in person for a long time, but... I just haven't quite figured out how to show you my sincerity. I've finally bought something suitable to make amends. I don't know what to do if you don't accept it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row's tone was downright humble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Grace had not seen what was in the box, she guessed that it was not something cheap. "You don't have to give me anything. Besides, you already sent me yellow roses to express your apology, haven't you?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not understand why Curtis Row had suddenly sent another batch of yellow roses and even came to apologize in person after so many days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I want to show you my sincerity. Just take the gift as my apology." Curtis Row tried his best to push the box to Grace. He could only feel at ease when she accepted it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, he would be stuck in a wheelchair for the rest of his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little speechless. She had a feeling that Curtis Row was afraid of something. Even his hands that were giving her the gift were trembling faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. It's fine!" She declined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row was close to tears. It was the first time he was giving a woman a gift only to be rejected by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins, just take it. If you don't, I... I'm going to get down on my knees," said Curtis Row.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must be kidding me, Mr. Row," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kidding... I'm not kidding!' Curtis Row was so stung by her words that he was about to vomit blood. 'It's not easy to even apologize these days.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row wanted to slap himself even more at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Out of all people, why did I ignore the woman Jason and Brian both want to fight for? A wiggle of the finger from either of them could kill me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not even rely on the Row family to protect him as they would be ruined together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Curtis Row and Grace kept pushing back and forth, a figure suddenly rushed into the firm. When they saw Curtis Row and Grace standing among a bunch of yellow roses, they shouted, "Well, well, Curtis Row. You've got good taste now. You&rsquo;ve even come to a place like this to have fun. How are you going to explain yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row was dumbfounded. 'Why... Why is You Keer here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz, who was watching them not far away, was also dumbstruck. 'What&hellip; What is You Keer doing here? Although I've included the address so that You Keer could find Grace... this is too fast!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had only been less than ten minutes since she tagged You Keer in her post!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz did not expect that You Keer happened to have something to do nearby when she saw someone tagging her online account. Upon seeing the photos, she immediately got angry and rushed over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Andrea Schwartz's shock was followed by excitement. Since You Keer was here, the whole affair would get even more interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz could not help picking up her phone to secretly film the scene unfolding before her. She just hoped You Keer would make it worse and Grace would be screwed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You Keer rushed to Grace and raised her hand to wave it in Grace's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace grabbed her hand before it could reach her.</p></div>
