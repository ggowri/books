        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You admit it so readily," Lawrence sneered. "What about me? When we were young, didn't you say you liked me a lot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I did like you a lot. At that time, I liked your piano playing and I liked you because you were pure and gave people a very clear feeling, so I genuinely liked you and wanted to be friends with you," Jasper said, with Lawrence's childhood appearance flashing before her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you genuinely liked me back then, do you not like me at all now?" Lawrence asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed her lips. "I did genuinely like you back then, so when I heard your mother say that she wanted you to befriend me on purpose, to gain more benefits from the Reed family, the feeling of betrayal was so strong. That feeling of betrayal really made me uncomfortable, so I couldn't listen to your explanation. But if you ask me now if I like you even a little bit, then...I can tell you very clearly that the answer is no."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand that was holding her chin suddenly tightened. "You're being very direct! Aren't you afraid that I might do something cruel to you in this closed laboratory?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I don't want to deceive you," Jasper said. "You wouldn't like it if I lied to you, right? I feel guilty, regretful, and disgusted towards my feelings for you now, but there is no longer any love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disgusted?" He raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, disgusted. Because you made my family the target of revenge and almost caused them to die. I came to find you today not only to ask about the situation between you </span><span>and Daniel, but also to hope that you will turn yourself in," Jasper explained her intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surrender?" Lawrence chuckled, "Do you think that just because you expressed a hope, I will surrender? Besides, I don't think I have anything to surrender for. Is there any evidence of my crime?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper remained silent, realizing that she had been too naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Lawrence had really encouraged Daniel to commit a crime, currently, Daniel's testimony was the only evidence, and the police had no proof that Lawrence had actually done anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, in the end, the only one who would be sentenced was Daniel, while Lawrence could continue to evade the law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Jasper sighed and looked directly at Lawrence, "From now on, you are an enemy of the Reed family, and I will no longer feel guilty towards you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finished speaking and tried to pull away the hand that was holding her chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lawrence held on even tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, don't you think you're cruel? It was you who brought me into your world in the first place, and now you say you have no guilt towards me. Why do you have the right to abandon me like this, and why do you make me feel..." His voice abruptly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn't say was, why did she make him love her so much?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now she had made it clear to him what her feelings were, and the deeper his love for her, the more he was just humiliating himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was your actions that led us to this point. Now, there's no point in saying anything more," Jasper said, "Lawrence, let go of me. You're hurting my chin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No point? A hint of crimson appeared in his eyes. "Is your pain greater than mine, Jasper...? I hate it... Why did you have to bring me into your world back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly lowered his head, his lips getting closer and closer to hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't played the piano and she hadn't heard him, if she hadn't come looking for him, then the trajectory of his life would have been different. His parents would still be alive, but... he would never have met her!</span></p></div>
