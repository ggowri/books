        <h1>Chapter 1321</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason replied, "Okay. You'd better go to bed now. Stop overthinking it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I seem to be a little hungry," Grace said abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll have someone make you some food," he said as he rose to his feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's late. It's not very nice to wake someone up just so they can make me food. Besides... I'm in the mood for some fruit soup. I'll just go to the kitchen and make it myself," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll make it for you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You?" She was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just fruit soup. It'll be quick," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, Grace left the bedroom with Jason and they went to the kitchen together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sitting in a chair at the kitchen bar, Grace could not stop the smile from appearing on the corners of her lips as she watched Jason take out some fruits from the fridge, peel them, cut them, and then make soup with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed more approachable now. It was as if the gap between them was slowly closing. He no longer gave off that high and mighty feeling from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace placed her chin above her hands and looked at Jason who was busying himself. She liked the way things were right now very much. It was quiet and warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, the fruit soup was ready. Jason filled a bowl and put it in front of Grace. "It's still hot. Let it cool a little before eating. Otherwise, it'll burn your mouth," he warned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," she replied, stirring the spoon slowly in the bowl to let the heat evaporate faster. "By the way, Jay, what do you want for your birthday?" she asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly stiffened. 'Birthday... Yeah, my birthday is coming up, but... her birthday was such a mess last time.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, all he could think about when it came to birthdays was the time he had broken up with her on her birthday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had not broken up with her, they would not have gone through all those ups and downs. He would not be feeling heavy-hearted every time he thought of these either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sensing Jason's silence, Grace, who had hung her head low, looked up at him. "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hesitated a little before saying, "You don't need to prepare anything... for my birthday. Let's just have a simple celebration."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if we&rsquo;re just going to have a simple celebration, I still want to prepare a present for you. What would you like? You can ask for anything as long as I can get it," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes fluttered a little. "I... don't need any presents. Having you by my side is already the best present for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because of my previous birthday... that you&rsquo;re worried about yours?" Grace speculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his lips together and said nothing, so she knew she was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I did have a pretty awful birthday, but we wouldn't have the present if some things hadn't happened back then. Maybe we&rsquo;ve learned to cherish our time together more because we've lost it before," Grace said frankly.</p></div>
