        <h1>Chapter 1223</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You looking at me like that will give me the idea that you have deep feelings for me and that you love me very much!" Jason said as he suddenly looked up and stared at her with his dark peach blossom eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was embarrassed. "I'm just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Just what? Just looking around? Or do I just think he looks really good today?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that neither answer was appropriate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know what to say for a moment, so she could only look at him with her almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said lightly, "If you don't love me, don't look at me like that again. It&rsquo;ll only make me misunderstand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I see," she said in a hurry and lowered her head to eat the food in her bowl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How did I look at him just now? Why would he misunderstand that I love him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do I still love Jason? Do I still love the man I used to love so deeply?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason and Grace went to tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau after breakfast. It was not a special day, so there were not many people around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason waited for their turn as they sat on the chairs in the waiting area after taking their queue number. There were still three couples in front of them waiting to get married... or divorced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Divorces and marriages were handled at the same counter and waiting area, which was somewhat awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the fact that Jason had to wait in line was refreshing to Grace. After all, he usually did not have to queue for anything. Everything would be taken care of for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, they had taken a queue number just like members of the general public and were waiting for their number to be called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a young woman sitting next to Grace approached her and asked, "Are you here to get married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can tell by the matching outfits you're wearing. Your husband is so handsome. He's even more handsome than celebrities," she complimented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing the word &lsquo;husband&rsquo;, Grace blushed as if a little uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason seemed to hear it and looked at the flush on Grace's face. "Not used to the word husband?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not... Not really." Rather than being unaccustomed to it, it was just that she had never experienced it, so she was suddenly at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's for the best. You have to get used to it," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes. Madam, husband, and wife. She had to get used to some titles after changing her status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand to caress her flushed face. "Soon, we'll truly be husband and wife. We&rsquo;ll never separate again, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words were so soft and gentle, but they hit her heart like a boulder that began to cause ripples.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand could not help caressing her belly. She only felt her cheeks burning more, and her heartbeat seemed to intensify.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The young woman's eyes lit up immediately. She only felt that the scene before her was like a scene in idol dramas. It was so beautiful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially that man... Was he not an idol?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman secretly took her phone out and took a photo as she thought of this. She sent it to her friend, who was an entertainment reporter familiar with most celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she sent the photo, it was not long before they replied to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Entertainment Reporter: [Where did you get the photo of this man? Oh my God! Do you know who he is?]</p></div>
