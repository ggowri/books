        <h1>Chapter 2403</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss immediately froze and looked up at Grace with a half-smile. "You should ask Jason that. After all, he was hypnotized too, wasn't he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla isn't entirely devoid of affection for you. I don't know what you're thinking, but whatever it is, I hope you won't hurt her. She's had a hard enough life," murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly smiled sarcastically. "Grace, you're wrong. She's the one who hurt me. She refused to give me a chance and wanted to separate from me, yet you're asking me not to hurt her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She didn't want to hurt you. She was only trying to protect you!" she blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look of sarcasm on his face deepened. "Protect me? Do I need her to protect me? What makes her think she can protect me? Grace, aren't you a lawyer? Since when did you start making things up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace helplessly shut her mouth. Martin Weiss&rsquo;s misunderstanding was too deep. Besides that, his feelings for Kyla had also faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, watching how Martin Weiss tucked in Kyla made her think that perhaps Martin Weiss still had feelings for Kyla even though he had been hypnotized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace left, Martin Weiss turned to look at Kyla, who was still sound asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her arched eyebrows furrowed again as if she was having another bad dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's probably dreaming about Amber Mitchell again,' Martin Weiss thought to himself. Amber Mitchell, her children, her mother, her friends... There were too many people who were more important than him to her. He was nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She begged him when she needed him and kicked him away without mercy when she did not need him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me. Between us, who hurt who?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, only the air answered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Grace received a phone call from Whitney Herrera, who wanted to consult her about some legal issues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had given Whitney Herrera her business card when she talked to her at the party that day, she did not expect her to contact her so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace arrived at the private room Whitney Herrera had reserved, she found Brian sitting beside Whitney Herrera and her assistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins, you're Mr. Hart's friend, so I can trust you. After all, I don't want the outside world to know about my comeback yet, so I&rsquo;d like to consult you about some contract terms and legal matters," Whitney Herrera said to Grace with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew she was trying to befriend her only because she knew Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, why would she consult an unknown lawyer like her when the Moss family had their own legal team?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled back. "Sure, I'd be happy to answer your questions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the meal, Grace learned that Whitney Herrera was planning to make a comeback and wanted to have a stake in the Hart family's newly established film and television company. Brian came to Deer City this time to prepare for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera said she asked Grace to dine with her to consult with her regarding some legal issues, but she did not ask anything about any legal issues during the meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I have a plot that I&rsquo;d like to turn into a film. Even though it's just a film and any similarities would be purely coincidental, I thought I'd better talk to the Moss family about it first," Brian said suddenly.</p></div>
