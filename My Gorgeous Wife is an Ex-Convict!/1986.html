        <h1>Chapter 1984</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At the same time, her stomach growled as if to remind her that she had missed dinnertime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you hungry? I'll ask the chef to prepare dinner. We'll go home right now. WE should be able to eat when we reach," said Hadwin Stephenson as he made a phone call to Stephenson Residence. He relayed what he wanted for dinner, took Lina's hand, and walked out of the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, instead of heading to the main entrance like usual, they went to the side entrance. However, the side entrance was also packed with reporters. Fortunately, Hadwin Stephenson had arranged many security guards here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although the reporters tried to squeeze over, they could not get close to Hadwin Stephenson and Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson protected Lina as they walked forward, and the reporters kept asking all sorts of sharp questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, a female reporter asked a question. "Mr. Hadwin Stephenson, Miss Lina was your girlfriend five years ago. Do you want to make things up to her because of guilt? Is that why you won't say anything? Even though she&rsquo;s fooling you, are you still going to be kind to her and not expose her in front of others?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stopped in his tracks as he glanced at the female reporter coldly. The reporter could not help wincing as she felt like she had nowhere to hide under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if he had seen right through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Is it as I said?" The female reporter went on as she bit the bullet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina gripped Hadwin Stephenson's right hand as she pressed her lips together tightly. She hung her head low as if all the commotion around her had nothing to do with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Only Hadwin Stephenson knew how nervous and flustered she was. His fingers hurt faintly from her grip. Her body was tense as a layer of cold sweat broke out on her palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The way she looked broke his heart. He had failed to protect her back then and could only watch her get hurt. Was he still going to fail at protecting her this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All these years, he kept making himself stronger by conspiring and plotting. All he wanted was to be able to protect her, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I can tell you that the baby in Miss Lina's stomach is mine. They're going to be the heir of the Stephenson family whether they're a boy or a girl!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was an uproar around them as soon as he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If Hadwin Stephenson had only acknowledged the baby, they could say that he was guilty or trying to make amends. However, if he was going to hand over the Stephenson family to the baby in Lina's stomach... Then there was only one possibility!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The baby in Lina's stomach was indeed Hadwin Stephenson's!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, no man would give his family fortune to a child who was not biologically related to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, Hadwin Stephenson was still young and at his prime age. If he wanted children, plenty of women would be willing to give him a baby. He had no reason to give his family fortune to a child with unknown blood ties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina also looked up in surprise. She stared blankly at Hadwin Stephenson as if she could not believe what she had just heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said nothing else after that, and he led Lina into the car.</p></div>
