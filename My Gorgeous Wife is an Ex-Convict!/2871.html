        <h1>Chapter 2869</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had sketched them secretly, or when he modeled for her, or just based on her imagination... She was almost halfway through the sketchbook and planned to wait until it was full before giving it to him as a present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the sketchbook had now become a consolation for her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller flipped through page after page of the sketchbook. In the sketches, he was either looking down, reading a book while leaning against the window, or smiling back at her. They were all stunning... She loved every sketch of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thud! Thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly realized she was crying when tears fell on the sketch paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hurriedly, she wiped the tears from the paper with her sleeve before wiping the ones on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't cry! Don't cry!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She desperately said to herself in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, tears continued pouring out of her eyes. She could not stop them no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? You broke up with Brian?" When Camille Strickland came to Valda Theller's home the next day, she saw her best friend's swollen eyes and heard the shocking news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, we broke up," said Valda Theller, her voice hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did it happen so suddenly? Wasn&rsquo;t your relationship doing well?" Camille Strickland was confused. As if she was suddenly reminded of something, she said, "Did he misunderstand you after seeing the videos of you online? Does he think you're a mean and selfish person who doesn't care about your family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Valda Theller shook her head. "No one is right or wrong in this breakup. We're just not the right one for each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was flabbergasted. The words &lsquo;not the right one&rsquo; could mean different things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who suggested it?" Camille Strickland could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I did," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Camille Strickland sighed. She could see that her best friend did not want to talk much about it. In that case, she would not ask too many questions. She would listen whenever Valda was willing to share.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm stupid, aren't I?" Valda Theller sighed. "I had such a powerful boyfriend whom I could show off, but now, I have only myself to rely on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're stupid, but you can still rely on me. Come, come, you can rely on me!" Camille Strickland answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both tried to defuse the subject's weight in a lighthearted tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I'll be here for you whenever you need me," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled faintly. "Camille, thank you. It's nice to have a friend like you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea how long it would take her to forget her feelings for Brian, but at least she had to get used to the fact that the man was no longer with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was rare for Patrick to see Brian so drunk. A bunch of empty wine bottles had filled the mansion's coffee table.</p></div>
