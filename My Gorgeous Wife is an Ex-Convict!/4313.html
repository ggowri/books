        <h1>Chapter 4311 Proposal to Annul the Engagement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is she hoping for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is she hoping that he also genuinely likes her as much as she does?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the answer he just gave is the most realistic one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chances of two people like Chandler and Tina, who have been engaged since childhood, actually liking each other are already very slim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she used to envy Tina a lot, envying the harmony between Tina and Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they were both engaged at a young age, their feelings for each other were completely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tina lost her memory and the news of her divorce from Chandler came out, she felt regret and sadness for a long time, as if something beautiful in her heart had been shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Tina has now taken steps forward again, heading towards Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hopefully, this time, Tina and Chandler will truly have a good outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to take me, I can take a taxi back to school myself," Harley tried to force a smile, hiding her disappointment, not wanting him to see any clues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Harley turned around, intending to leave the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could take two steps, Lornell grabbed her arm, saying, "I'll take you to school. Otherwise, if something happens to you on the way, I wouldn't be able to explain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were just ordinary words, but as Harley listened, her heart sank even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If something happened to her, would he only be concerned about having to explain? Instead of being sad, worried, or anxious for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, does that mean he truly doesn't love her, or rather, he has no desire for her at all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is there really a need to maintain such a marriage contract?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does their engagement mean to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley didn't say anything else, but obediently followed Lornell to the front of the car and got in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They remained silent throughout the journey, and as the car was approaching the school, Harley suddenly spoke up, "How about we call off the engagement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's body suddenly stiffened: "What are you saying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, how about we call off the engagement?" Harley repeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's thin lips tightened, but she didn't say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car continued to drive forward as if she hadn't said anything just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence was filled with an inexplicable sense of repression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the car stopped in front of the school gate, Lornell suddenly spoke, "Why did you call off the engagement? Haven't you always loved me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, if she had asked to get married immediately after reaching the marriageable age, he wouldn't have been surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she insisted on breaking off the engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at Lornell in disbelief and suddenly smiled bitterly. He had known all along!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell had always known that she had a crush on him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I have always liked you," she took a deep breath, "but I realized that your feelings towards me may not be what I want. The engagement between us has become a kind of bondage, so I want to break it off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have never said that this engagement is a bondage to me," he said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head and thought to herself: That's because, to him, this engagement is the best shield, blocking the entanglement of those women who annoy him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can get out of the car. I can pretend that I didn't hear what you said today. The Quentin family's engagement is not something that can be undone just by saying it!" Lornell said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I..." she wanted to say something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's face became even colder: "Get out of the car!"</span></p></div>
