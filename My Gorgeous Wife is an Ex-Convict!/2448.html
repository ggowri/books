        <h1>Chapter 2446</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was anxious, but George Gregory had already spoken up. If she insisted on opposing, her action would undoubtedly humiliate George Gregory and make others more suspicious of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell could only force herself to calm down and stand beside George Gregory as they waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Time ticked by. About more than half an hour later, the consultation room door was suddenly pushed open. The nurse wheeled Amber Mitchell out as she was sitting in a wheelchair, then came along the doctor who had diagnosed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's heart sank when she saw the doctor, who was a famous psychiatrist in Deer City. She did not expect them to arrange for this psychiatrist to diagnose Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Amber Mitchell was wheeled out, she saw many people and flashing lights in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On her way over, she recalled Grace saying to her, "The road ahead might be rough, and all sorts of things could happen, but I hope you'll be as calm as possible. What you need most right now is to stay calm. The best response when facing an enemy is to be calm and not lose control of your emotions. We'll try our best to help you as well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Calm down... It's all I have to do now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to be the high-spirited heiress of the Mitchell family after being released from prison, but she had suffered immensely in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell glanced at the people not far away. She saw Grace, who had brought her here, and Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was heavily pregnant, but she looked at her eagerly and anxiously as she stood in the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's eyes instantly watered. 'Kyla...' She did not expect her to insist on finding her and do anything to save her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she would spend her whole life in that hopeless hospital and maybe choose to end her life when she could not stand it one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just as she was getting increasingly desperate, Kyla and her friend showed up to give her hope!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a reporter tried to break through the bodyguards in front and shouted at Amber Mitchell, "Miss Amber Mitchell, is it true that you were abused in the hospital? Can you answer our questions in a clear mind now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then came a barrage of questions from more reporters. "Miss Amber Mitchell, do you have anything to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you lose your finger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How were you abused?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell rushed forward to approach Amber Mitchell. "Shut up. My sister is still a patient. Is this how you treat a patient? I'm going to get to the bottom of this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she tried to walk up to Amber Mitchell, one of Jason's bodyguards stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell glared at the bodyguard. "Get out of my way. I'm my sister's guardian. Who are you to stop me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a voice rang out. "I think whether Amber Mitchell needs a guardian is controversial. At least according to my preliminary diagnosis, Amber Mitchell is normal. Despite spending so many years in a mental hospital and faced with so much stress, she's normal and not a mental patient."</p></div>
