        <h1>Chapter 3059</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He desperately reached out his hand, wanting to pull her back to the shore, not wanting her to die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda... don't... don't... I won't allow you to die... You can't die, no matter what..." He shouted desperately, and his hands were reaching out desperately, but he couldn't grasp anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Suddenly, he abruptly opened his eyes, only to find a white ceiling in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda!" In front of me, it feels like my dreams and reality are constantly intertwining.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sat up abruptly, wanting to rush out of bed to save the woman who was about to be engulfed by the waves...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, you can't get out of bed right now." Someone held him down, preventing him from getting up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go of me, I have to save Valda, let go of me!" Brian shouted desperately, trying to push the person stopping him away. "If we don't save Valda now, she'll be washed away by the water. I have to go, get out of my way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, he could no longer distinguish between reality and dreams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Until a voice suddenly sounded, "Brian, snap out of it. Valda has already been washed away by the water. If you keep struggling like this, you'll only make your condition worse. Do you want to collapse before finding her?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This voice made Brian's struggle come to a sudden stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared blankly at the person in front of him, "Valda... she's been washed away by the water?" The words seemed to be squeezed out of his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, the police and the people around me are all looking for Valda's whereabouts." Jason said, "Even if you really run to the river now, what can you do with your current physical condition? Everything you can do is being done by professionals!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's body suddenly trembled, and he closed his eyes abruptly. So it turned out that reality was even more cruel than his dreams. So it turned out that Valda had already been washed away by the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long have I been unconscious?" After a long time, he finally asked, his voice hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's been a day and a night," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So... you've been looking for Valda for a day and a night too, right?" Brian muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A day and a night, and you still haven't found her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not finding her can be good news sometimes," Jason said. In other words, if they haven't found Valda's body after a day, it's possible that she's still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good news?" Brian suddenly laughed, but the laughter was tinged with endless sadness. He suddenly opened his eyes and stared at Jason, "You're saying it's good news? Why? Why did she have to die? Why couldn't it have been..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice suddenly stopped, choked with bitterness!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he didn't finish his sentence, it was already enough to understand what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, it's the Reed family that owes her," Jason said. He rarely apologizes or admits fault, but he was saying it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry? Jason, I don't want your apologies, I just want Valda, give her back to me!" Brian's eyes were bloodshot as he glared at Jason, screaming in agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was also shocked as he looked at Brian's expression.</p></div>
