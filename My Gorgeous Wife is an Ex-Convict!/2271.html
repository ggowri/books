        <h1>Chapter 2269</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying this, Martin Weiss moved the dagger in his hand and cut a wound in his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert laughed at the sight of it. "Good, good! Chairman Weiss, you're such a sentimental person! But Kyla has two wounds on her neck. Shouldn't you cut yourself one more time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pursed his thin lips, and a second wound instantly appeared on his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tears in Kyla's eyes finally could not help falling. &lsquo;He knows Mr. Lambert is up to no good, yet he did it anyway. What a fool!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Isn't he a businessman? Isn't he supposed to be calculating? Why...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears made him panic. "Don't cry. I'm not in pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the blood on his neck kept running down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, since you don't feel pain, cut your neck a little deeper to see how much it takes to make you feel pain! If you don&rsquo;t do it, I'll cut this woman's neck!" Mr. Lambert shouted arrogantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss raised his hand and left the third cut on his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The red blood made his face look paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I forbid you from doing that again!" Kyla shouted as she wept, the pain spreading in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out she would be in so much pain seeing him get hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was no use. Her voice had no effect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a fourth wound on his neck now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, that's enough! If you're sorry and guilty, you've done enough to make it up to me. It's enough!" Kyla shouted at the top of her lungs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Kyla, smiled slightly, and said nothing. His eyes seemed to be telling her silently that he was not doing all these things out of feeling sorry for her or regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just because... he loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved her, so his life would always be at her disposal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could do anything to make her suffer less. It did not matter how humiliating or torturing it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With more and more wounds on Martin Weiss's body, Mr. Lambert laughed more and more complacently. He did not notice the two young men beside him exchanging a look. Just when Mr. Lambert got carried away and the dagger he held was slightly farther away from Kyla's neck, one of the young men suddenly attacked Mr. Lambert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other young man pulled Kyla aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss and the police also rushed forward. Martin Weiss immediately protected Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police quickly subdued the three men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two young men shouted, "Mr. Weiss, Police, we made up for it! Mr. Weiss hinted that we could have our sentence reduced if we helped!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, we'll write it down and pass it to the court as evidence!" a policeman said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another policeman came over with gauze and hastened to stop Martin Weiss and Kyla&rsquo;s bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face was ghastly pale because he had lost a lot of blood. He looked like he was going to faint at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla nervously asked the police tending to Martin Weiss's wounds, "Is he okay?"</p></div>
