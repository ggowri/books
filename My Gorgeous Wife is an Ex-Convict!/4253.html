        <h1>Chapter 4251 I won't be mad at you</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This desire and longing made him want to break free from here and find the person who could make him feel no pain, to hold that person tightly in his arms!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't do that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His remaining sanity was desperately suppressing this desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina, now that she has lost her previous memories, doesn't remember his curse or her promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, everything that happened in the past no longer exists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to tell her everything she had promised in the past, including his curse, it would only be a kind of shackles for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of her, a sharp pain surged in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cares more about Kit than he imagined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He initially thought that she would erase that man from her heart after witnessing her determination toward Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he knew that she hated being deceived by others. Even though she had lost her memory, this fact hadn't changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he believed that Kit would never have another chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't until he saw her protecting Kit in the alley that he realized he had been too simplistic in his thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the person who had been with Tina all those months was Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During that time, Kit was the person Tina relied on the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Tina, who had no memories, Kit at that time was a kind of redemption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such an existence, even though he had deceived her, how could he possibly treat it as if it didn't exist?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he accompanied Tina to the hospital, he felt jealousy gnawing at him. If he stayed any longer, he was afraid he wouldn't be able to control that jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his pain was about to flare up, which is why he hurriedly returned to the Hunter family in the middle of the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how much time had passed, but the pain in his body gradually faded away, and Chandler felt completely exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closer he got to Tina, the harder it became for him to control himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would constantly recall the love she had shown him before and then feel extremely upset because of her lack of love for him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After coming out of the medicine bath, he cleaned himself up and put on his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he stepped out of the room, a servant approached him and said, "Mr. Hunter, Ms. Hunter is here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was taken aback. Ms. Hunter mentioned by the servant could only be one person - Tina!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is she?" Chandler asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The old Mr. Hunter has already arranged for her to stay in a guest room," the servant replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was momentarily stunned, then understood why she had been assigned a guest room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These past few days were the days when his pain flared up. Grandfather knew he didn't want Tina to know about his physical condition, so he gave her a guest room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Chandler arrived at the guest room and saw Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you come?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I couldn't reach you on your phone. When I found out you were back, I came to look for you!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just came back to see Grandfather and my parents," he made up an excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you mad at me?" Tina asked directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at the person in front of him affectionately. "Tina, I'm not mad at you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After experiencing the pain of losing her, how could he still be angry with her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only be angry with himself, angry at his own mistakes, angry that he couldn't make her love him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chandler's words didn't make Tina feel any better. Instead, they made the heavy feeling in her chest even more pronounced.</span></p></div>
