        <h1>Chapter 3754</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Mason took out his phone directly, dialed a number, and said to the other end of the phone, "Driver Zack, come to the second teaching building of the school now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Mason put away his phone and looked at Vanessa with a cold and indifferent gaze, "You can see the confrontation you wanted to see soon, but after that, you will also have to pay the price for what you said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An uneasy feeling enveloped Vanessa. What was going on? Why was this little white face so calm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To find Veronica's financial backer for a confrontation, how could this be possible? This was a lie that would be exposed with just one poke. Wasn't this little white face afraid of being even more embarrassed later?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are, saying these things..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Vanessa could finish her sentence, the voice of the head of the department rang out urgently, "You must be Mason. I didn't expect you to come to our school. The school will deal with the rumors about Veronica as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The department head walked quickly to Mason's side, speaking warmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa's eyes widened in surprise. Did the department head know this "little white face"?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know him, sir?" Vanessa couldn't help but ask. "He's the kept man of Veronica's outside. Don't let them fool you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The department head was furious at this accusation. "Do you even know what you're talking about?!" he scolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The term "little white face" made the department head feel dizzy. If he angered Mason from the Reed family, who knows what kind of consequences the school would face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially with so many people around to hear the term "little white face"!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" the department head rebuked. "I don't know how you can speak so casually like this. Mason is from the Reed Group and has nothing to do with what you're saying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement caused a commotion among the surrounding crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Reed family was famous in Emerald City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Mason from such a wealthy family be a "little white face"?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa was stunned, her eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is it possible that Veronica knows someone like him?" Vanessa blurted out her thoughts without thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at her coldly. "Why couldn't she know someone like me? It seems you haven't learned your lesson from last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy tone and disgusted gaze made Vanessa shiver, remembering the scene of being dragged out of the restaurant that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That scene had once been a great shame to her, but now it seemed that even more unfortunate things were waiting for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the person in front of her is really the Reed family Mason, Vanessa can hardly imagine what her fate will be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, did you call me over for something?" a man walked up to Mason and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As this man arrived, the murmurs of the onlookers grew louder. Vanessa stared at the man in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was the one who was keeping Veronica, but now he was addressing Mason as Mr. Mason?!</span></p></div>
