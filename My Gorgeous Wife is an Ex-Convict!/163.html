        <h1>Chapter 162</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back then, the gossip news had gone all-in when talking about how much Brian doted on Emily. If Emily had wanted to become the leading actress in a film, then she would get the role. If Emily hadn't liked the director for a film she was starring in, then he would replace the director. If Emily wanted her birthday banquet to be held at the most luxurious hotel in Emerald City, he would reserve the entire hotel...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">With such attention and care from him, it was no wonder that everyone thought that Emily would marry into his powerful family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, who would have thought that it would turn out like this in the blink of an eye?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though Emily was begging him like this, there was no sign of pity on his face. No, it could be said that there was no emotion in his eyes at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whether it was towards Emily or her!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although it seemed that he was trying to help by teaching Emily a lesson, the way he looked at her was indifferent and distant.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if no one could really get close to this man. Even if they just got close to him temporarily, they would never be able to break through the barricade around his heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emily realized that pleading with Brian wasn't working, so she turned to Grace and said, "I was wrong just now. Please forgive me... Please... Please help me put in a few good words with Brian. I'm begging you. Now that Brian dotes on you so much, he will agree to whatever you say."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What she was afraid of was not that Grace might slap her again, but Brian's displeasure. She was scared that after the slap, she might be completely blacklisted within the entertainment circle.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace looked at Emily and said, "You have mistaken me for someone else. I am not Brian's current girlfriend, so I can't ask him for anything."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After that, she raised her head to look at Brian and said, "She slapped me, and I slapped her back. We're even now, so I don't need to hit her anymore."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is that so?" Brian said faintly. There was no joy or anger in his voice.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Hart, I have also joined to today's meal. Thank you for treating me. I want to go home early, so I will have to leave first," Grace continued. After saying this, she walked past him and left.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian looked at Grace's departing back before he turned around and looked at the pale-faced Emily.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Emily's eyes were full of tears, and she looked as though she was about to start crying at any second. Her originally beautiful face seemed to have become pitiful because of her panic.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian raised his hand and brushed Emily's eyes with his finger. "You're going to cry?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Brian, I just love you too much and I don't want to lose you. I know that I was being impulsive today. I... I will never do this again in the future," Emily said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You love me too much?" Brian replied indifferently.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes... Yes, I love you. I really love you. Brian, you are the only man I have ever loved in my life. Let's not break up, okay?" Emily uttered her words one by one. Her voice was mixed with slight sobs and droplets of tears were falling down her cheeks, moving the hearts of the people who were still around.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, there wasn't the slightest hint of emotion on Brian's face. He only spat in a cold voice, "But I've never loved you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emily's body turned stiff and his voice continued to ring in her ears as he said, "I don't like women who like causing scenes."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This simple sentence made Emily's body tremble even more. He had once had an ex-girlfriend who had come to him to make trouble. She had heard him talk about that person herself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After that, it could be said that the troublemaking ex-girlfriend had disappeared from the entertainment industry. All news related to her was directly censored by her company, and she was rejected by all of the directors when applying for shoots. Later, she had heard that the woman had accumulated a lot of debt and eventually fled abroad.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for how she was doing now, she did not know, but she knew that things couldn't be going too well for her.</p></div>
