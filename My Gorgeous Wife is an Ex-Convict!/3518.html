        <h1>Chapter 3516</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason is leaving! She needs to hurry to the airport to stop him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this in mind, Veronica quickly threw off her blanket and tried to get out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper quickly stopped her and asked, "Veronica, what are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to the airport to find out from Mason what really happened with the kidnapping," she said. If he tells her that he had nothing to do with it, she'll believe him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, she should trust him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's Mason, the Mason she grew up with. But now, even Jasper sees him more clearly than she does, and she's still blindly suspicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait! Veronica, even if you go now, it's already too late!" Jasper quickly stopped her. "Mason's plane should have already taken off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take off?" Veronica was taken aback for a moment, then quickly began searching for something. "Where's my phone? My phone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here!" Jasper quickly handed Veronica her phone, which was placed on the bedside table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica dialed Mason's number, but couldn't get through no matter how many times she tried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Jasper advised, "The phone on the plane must have been turned off. Wait until Mason lands and then try calling him again, Veronica."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know where Mason is going abroad?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper shook his head, "I'm not sure either, but Veronica, once you get through to Mason on my phone, you should be able to find out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper believed that as long as Veronica wanted to reconcile with Mason, it wouldn't take long for them to make up and for Mason to come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica tightly held her phone in her hand. Yes, she thought, once she asked, she would know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, what Veronica didn't expect was that no matter how many times she tried to call Mason's phone, she couldn't get through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she went to the Reed family to inquire about Mason's situation, it was the head of the Reed family, Jason, who met her in the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason... where is he now?" Veronica asked urgently. "Is he safe? I was worried something had happened to him since he wasn't answering my calls."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason is currently in Zambia and nothing has happened to him," Jason replied. "However, he won't be returning home until the day of the trial when he will testify."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback. If he wasn't returning until the day of the trial, that meant she wouldn't see him for at least another two months!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she... she really wanted to see Mason now. She wanted to understand what had happened with the kidnapping case and hear it from Mason himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where in Zambia is Mason now?" Veronica asked, pressing for more information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not sure," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback. "Not sure? What does that mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It means that as soon as he arrived in Zambia, he got rid of the Reed family and the bodyguards who were with him. But every night, he calls to let us know he's safe. Obviously, he doesn't want anyone to know his exact location," Jason said. Or maybe he's afraid someone will go looking for him and it will affect his decision?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason naturally understood his son's thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica fell silent. Did she really have to wait two months for the trial to begin before she could see Mason again and hear the truth about the case from him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Jason handed a stack of documents to Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is something you're interested in, I think you'll want to take a look," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica took the files, but her eyes widened suddenly when she saw the first page. It was...the investigation materials and testimonies from everyone involved in the kidnapping case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These...shouldn't be visible!</p></div>
