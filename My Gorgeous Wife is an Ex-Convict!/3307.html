        <h1>Chapter 3305</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did Taelyn meet Valda in the restroom and then had a conversation with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Brian thought of this, his face changed and he rushed straight into the bathroom, afraid that Taelyn might do something harmful to Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, when he was in a relationship with the other person, he provided them with some resources. However, after they broke up, Taelyn's resources gradually decreased and he was no longer as successful as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he and Taelyn had a peaceful breakup, it has been many years since then and Taelyn's life is currently going well. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would go after Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, whenever something involves Valda, he loses his ability to make rational decisions and only wants to rush to her side as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian rushed over to the sink, he saw Taelyn reaching out her hand towards Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly rushed forward and stood in front of Valda, "Taelyn, what are you going to do?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taelyn was stunned, her hand even frozen in mid-air. "Brian?! You...you're here too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What exactly do you want to do to Valda?!" Brian questioned again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Taelyn was still a bit stunned, but Valda peeked out from behind Brian and said, "Brian, Miss Taelyn didn't do anything to me. We were just talking about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, Brian was stunned, "Talking about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, like where you used to like going, what your hobbies were, and uh, how many women used to chase after you..." Valda said, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Facing his ex-girlfriend, she couldn't resist her gossiping heart and asked about his past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because that was the him she wasn't familiar with! It was the him before they met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to know more about him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian pursed his lips, looked at Valda, then at Taelyn, "Is that all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What else could there be?" Valda muttered, "Do you want to fight when you meet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words made him feel a bit helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taelyn looked at the two in front of her and said to Brian, "Long time no see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It has been a long time," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just saw your wife and couldn't help but start a conversation with her," Taelyn thought for a moment and said, "I guess I was really curious about what kind of woman could make you want to marry her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian stared at Taelyn with cold, piercing eyes, as if he was scrutinizing the truthfulness of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taelyn couldn't help but feel even more emotional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, he was still as cold and distant as he was back then, but... just now, seeing him rush in with a worried expression on his face, it was difficult for her to connect him with the person he is now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or perhaps it should be said...his anxiety and concern were only for Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And for others, in his mind, they don't carry that same weight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just had an interesting chat with Mrs. Hart. I think I understand why you married her," Taelyn chuckled. "I wish you both happiness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "So, let's talk again when we have the chance," to Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, okay," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taelyn walked away, and Brian turned around to face Valda. Suddenly, he bent down and rested his head on her shoulder, wrapping his arms around her waist. He let out a long sigh and said, "I'm glad you're okay."</p></div>
