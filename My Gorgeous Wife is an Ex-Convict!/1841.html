        <h1>Chapter 1839</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The memorial tablets of Jason's father and Old master Reed were set up in the inner hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts's eyes turned red when she saw the two memorial tablets. She quickly said, "I... I'll offer some incense!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, she picked up the unused incense sticks in front of the memorial tablets, lit them up, and offered them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts glanced at his wife and followed suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Watts, are you okay?" asked Grace when she looked at Mrs. Watts's red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It&rsquo;s n-nothing. I just think it's a pity that your father-in-law... died so young," murmured Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My father-in-law loved my mother-in-law too much. He lost the will to live after losing the person he loved. Maybe death was a relief for him," Grace said with a sigh. However, her father-in-law had left his pain to the living to bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How... How did he die?" muttered Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He froze to death by the roadside. That's when Jay came back to the Reed family holding my father-in-law's ashes, "said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts turned pale and wobbled a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts immediately grabbed his wife. "What's the matter? Are you feeling sick?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, I feel a little sick. I... I want to go back to the hotel and rest," said Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll ask the driver to take you back to the hotel," said Grace as the three walked out of the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Old Lawyer Watts and his wife got back to the hotel, Mrs. Watts could not stop her tears and began crying her eyes out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts sighed too. Today was the first time he saw what that man looked like!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could have inherited the Reed family and stood at the apex of Emerald City's power and wealth, yet he died in such a way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's my fault. It's all my fault!" As if unable to contain the pain, Mrs. Watts finally shouted, "I did Kim wrong. If I hadn't left at the time, Kim wouldn't have died! I killed him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts did not know how to comfort his wife and only patted her on the shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He froze to death... A man like him ended up freezing to death. Milo, I never thought he would freeze to death!" sobbed Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For years, she had been speculating about the cause of his death but she never expected it to be this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It was because of me. It was because of me! If I hadn't abandoned him and Jay, he wouldn't have made this choice. I was corrupted with greed. I was ruthless!" Mrs. Watts kept pounding her chest. The delicate makeup on her face became streaked with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If he knows how sorry you feel, he&rsquo;ll forgive you," said Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, Kim won't forgive me. He won't forgive me..." Mrs. Watts said with agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She once thought she would never return to Emerald City or set foot in the Reed family&rsquo;s house again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she eventually learned that Jason was the husband of Grace, who was her husband's apprentice. The small child who had called her &lsquo;Grandma&rsquo; for more than two years was her biological granddaughter! After finding out about everything, she could not contain the longing in her heart anymore.</p></div>
