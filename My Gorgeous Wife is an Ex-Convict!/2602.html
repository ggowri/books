        <h1>Chapter 2600</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, Martin Weiss's voice rang out again, "You get out too. I'd like to dine alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls was shocked. "But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But?" Martin Weiss glared coldly at Shana Nicholls, instantly making her swallow the rest of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it. I'll leave immediately." She looked down and obediently left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, she felt as if he had seen through her, and fear came over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I must be overthinking,' Shana Nicholls told herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the following days, Martin Weiss did not dine with Kyla at the same table, and the servants' respect for her slowly diminished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In particular, the servants heard that Martin Weiss wanted to divorce Kyla, but she refused. Therefore, she came to the mansion to get Martin Weiss to change his mind. Everyone looked down on her even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, these things did not bother Kyla. Martin Weiss was all that mattered to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had few chances to see Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the room, Kyla headed to the mansion's yard. The mansion had a large yard with many osmanthus flowers. It was the season when the air smelled of osmanthus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla recalled how she had told Martin Weiss that she hoped their house could one day be filled with the scent of osmanthus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because they had watched a movie together where the male and female leads go to know each other due to osmanthus. Osmanthus flowers were shown throughout the movie, which also made her fall in love with osmanthus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This mansion's yard was now full of osmanthus plants. Was it because she said she loved the smell of osmanthus back then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These plants looked like they were at least five years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ever since Kyla realized the mansion's yard was full of osmanthus, she would stroll the yard every afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that even smelling the fragrance of osmanthus could make her mood better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to her surprise, she saw Martin Weiss in the yard today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was lying on a deck chair with his eyes closed as the breeze gently blew the hair on his forehead, revealing his plump forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not open his eyes as she approached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he asleep?' she thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was less indifferent but quieter with his eyes closed. His long lashes cast a shadow over the bottom of his eyes. His tall nose bridge and sexy thin lips made him as handsome as ever. However, his eyes seemed somewhat haggard. His pale complexion and his thin cheeks made him seem more sickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was sick because of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Kyla's heart sank as her gaze went to his chest. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only wearing a shirt right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The top few buttons of his shirt were unbuttoned, so the collar of his shirt hung open loosely, revealing his bewitching chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How is his wound? Is it healing like mine? Or... is the wound not doing well?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the doctor had said that the healing of the wound depended on the individual.</p></div>
