        <h1>Chapter 2262</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be careful," replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, do you know Mr. Lambert? He was the one who criticized you outside the venue of the full moon party. He&rsquo;s in hot water now. His family is almost bankrupt. He lost all his business deals and is asking around for a loan, but no one dares to loan him money," said Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla listened quietly, but her face showed no expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the corners of her eyes, Jacqueline Bowman shot Kyla a glance and said pointedly, "Mr. Lambert is suddenly so miserable because he offended Martin Weiss. Kyla, you're lucky to have married a man like Martin Weiss. He stands up for you unconditionally. On the other hand, I wasted my youth on a heartbreaker like Neal Reid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Live a good life and you'll meet your true love in the future," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? Then... why don't you introduce me to someone? There should be many eligible bachelors in Martin Weiss's company, right? Why don't you set me up with someone? I'll never forget your kindness if it&rsquo;s a success," Jacqueline Bowman said with a look of anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip. "I don't know anyone in his company, so I'm afraid I can't be of any help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? That's alright. We'll talk about it later, then." Jacqueline Bowman maintained a smile on her face, but she silently said in her head... 'Kyla, you brought this upon yourself!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they got inside the temple, Jacqueline Bowman led Kyla to offer incense and pray like she was familiar with the whole process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the solemn sitting statue, Kyla, who had never been religious, felt a surge of devoutness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If God does exist, I hope He can bless my mother, children, and friends with peaceful and happy lives. I hope I&rsquo;ll make it through this and have a smooth delivery. And I hope...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face could not help flashing across her mind. She recalled his pale face and the needle wound in his arm when she ran into him in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, there seemed to be a small voice in her heart saying... 'I hope Martin Weiss can be safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Perhaps... Martin Weiss has left a mark in my heart, after all? It&rsquo;s a mark that won't go away.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla emerged from the main hall, Jacqueline Bowman handed her an amulet that was sold in the temple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here, I just bought this. It's supposed to bless the baby. You have to wear it while you're in the temple. You can store it somewhere at home after leaving the temple." Jacqueline Bowman smiled as she held the amulet. She wanted to hang it around Kyla's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla subconsciously tried to dodge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, this is just a little token of my appreciation. Consider it an apology for what I said back then. You're not going to reject me, are you?" Jacqueline Bowman showed a look of guilt and expectation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together. In the end, she put on the amulet. A fragrance seemed to waft out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they got back into the car, Jacqueline Bowman suddenly started searching her body and bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My phone is missing. Maybe I left it in the temple. Wait for me in the car while I look for it," said Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla nodded.</p></div>
