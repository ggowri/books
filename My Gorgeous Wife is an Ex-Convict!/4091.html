        <h1>Chapter 4089</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon after, two people entered the room, chatting while cleaning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina considered revealing herself and explaining her presence, but then heard one of the cleaners say:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The young master came back today and is currently taking a medicinal bath. I heard that a servant tried to sneak in during his last bath to seduce him, but was scared off and went crazy. No one knows where they went after Hunter dealt with them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did they go crazy? Did something happen inside?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who knows? But during the young master's medicinal baths, no one else is allowed to be inside. I heard that if anyone dares to peek, their eyes will be gouged out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's...terrifying!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two cleaning maids were chatting, and Tina, who was hiding under the desk, shuddered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They mentioned Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Chandler is now taking a medicinal bath?! And it seems quite mysterious according to what they said!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, when the young master is taking a medicinal bath, no one can enter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the two maids left, Tina crawled out from under the desk, pondering over their conversation just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, Chandler is now taking a medicinal bath, and no one else can intrude!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... that's other people, so it shouldn't matter for her! Tina thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, the most important thing now is - how can she find Chandler?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fifteen minutes later, Tina unexpectedly found the place she wanted to find the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, she was just trying her luck. After all, the mansion was so big that she might have been discovered by Hunter's other people before finding Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she didn't know whether to say that she was lucky or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She actually found Chandler first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, at this moment, Tina's nose was filled with the pungent smell of medicine. She saw a familiar figure not far away, soaking in the medicinal water. The smooth back that she remembered was now covered with black lines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What's going on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get out!" A voice suppressed with pain surged from his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina's body suddenly trembled. She had never heard him make such a sound before, as if he was in pain, and even his voice was trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Is he feeling very uncomfortable?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> What happened?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And what are these black lines on his body?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Is it because something is wrong with his body that he needs to soak in this kind of potion?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> One question after another kept popping up in Tina's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her feet couldn't help but move forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Did you not hear me when I said not to tell anyone?" Another stern rebuke was followed by a splash, as if someone had stood up from the bath, and Tina felt the pungent potion splash all over her body!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, there was a knocking sound outside the door. "Young Master, we found someone breaking in on the surveillance. Are you okay? Do you need us to come in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> For a moment, Tina didn't know whether to describe the scene as chaotic or quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Outside the door, the knocking and questioning continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Inside the room, however, there was silence, as Chandler stared at her in shock.</p></div>
