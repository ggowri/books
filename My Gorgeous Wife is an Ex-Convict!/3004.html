        <h1>Chapter 3002</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not really," Brian said. "My family just owns two small factories, so we have a bit of money. The reason I said it's not ordinary is because we have some family ties with the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he mentioned it, Valda suddenly remembered that she had heard someone say something like that at the office door that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are Jason and Grace their relatives?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's quite far away, but usually, because of the family relationship with the Reed family, this family is given some face by others outside. Since we need to solve this matter now, it's inevitable that we have to say hello to Jason first," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go too!" said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced at Valda and asked, "Are you going too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, I asked for your help in this matter, so of course I should go," she said earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her and after a moment said, "Okay, let's go to the Reed family's place tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda arrived at the Reed family's doorstep with Brian in the evening, she suddenly became a bit nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She has been to the Reed family before, but this is her first time coming to the Reed family with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What if Brian sees Grace later and his attitude towards her changes? Will she feel jealous or show any strange expressions? Could this raise any suspicions from Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, a jumble of thoughts filled her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a short while, the servant led the two individuals into the house, where Jason, Grace, and two of the triplets were in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at Mick and Jasper, the twins, and found them extremely adorable. She wondered if her and Brian's baby would also be as cute as them in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no matter what, we will love our own children very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two children saw Valda and Brian. Jasper sweetly called out to them, acting familiar and friendly. Mick, on the other hand, politely greeted them but did not speak again. His small face carried a sense of indifference and aloofness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"These two children have noticeably different personalities. Oh, by the way, there's another one, right?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mason doesn't live here anymore, he lives with his foster family, but he comes over every weekend with the young lady from that family," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about Jasmine?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasmine is the daughter that Grace gave birth to at the cost of her health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace said, 'Jasmine is sleeping, let's check on her later.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay!" said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you come today to see the child?" Jason raised his eyebrows and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After he reminded her, Valda remembered the reason for their visit today. She turned to Jason and said, "Mr. Reed, Brian and I came here today to discuss something with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Jason instructed his servants to take the child out of the living room before turning to Valda and asking, "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian spoke, "Valda's high school art teacher is in trouble, and your relative caused trouble for this teacher. Although I can easily solve it, I came to say hello to you because it is your relative."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the Reed family has some relatives, they rarely interact with them. However, they didn't expect Valda and Brian to come today for a family matter.</p></div>
