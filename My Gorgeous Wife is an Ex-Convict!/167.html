        <h1>Chapter 166</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wasn't sure if she would really be able to meet Jason if she went to the office building of the Reed Group. But besides there, she didn't know where else she could find him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking about it, she knew very little about him. She didn't even know where he lived!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, when Grace arrived at the Reed Group in the afternoon, she discovered that she could not even walk through the entrance, let alone seeing Jason. She was immediately stopped by the security guards.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she said that she wanted to see Jason, she received a mocking look from the others.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If Mr. Reed were to meet everyone who just randomly shows up and asks for him, he wouldn't even have time to sleep! Every day, there are so many people like you who come here to visit him."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"When the others want to see Mr. Reed, they will at least dress up. With your outfit, who do you think will believe you when you say that you know Mr. Reed?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace lowered her head to look at the clothes she was wearing. She knew that these street vendor's clothes looked cheap and rough.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the eyes of these security guards, she was probably just a person who had come to look for an opportunity.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The only thing Grace could do was wait at the door for him. Standing to one side of the Reed Group's gate, she hugged her cotton-padded jacket.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The cold winter wind blew over her cheeks and went down through the collar into her clothes. Suddenly, her body felt a lot colder.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace rubbed her hands against each other. From time to time, she would blow some warm breath over her fingers. Her eyes were looking at the gate of the building. She hoped that she could meet Jason by waiting there.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, she knew that there was more than one entrance to the building, but the only thing she could do was wait at the gate which would give her the highest possibility of seeing him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, Grace's eyes lit up. She saw Terrence getting out of a car and heading into the Reed Group's Office Building.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Terrence!" Grace yelled anxiously. The only person she knew who was acquainted with Jason was Terrence.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence looked at the direction of the voice and saw Grace. His expression turned stern as if he was surprised.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Miss Cummins, why are you here?" Terrence stepped forward and asked politely.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I..." Grace bit her lip slightly, and her expression seemed a little uneasy and embarrassed. "I want to see... Mr. Reed. But I can't enter the building. Terrence, may I trouble you to take me to Mr. Reed?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence pondered for a moment before saying, "Okay. Miss Cummins, follow me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he spoke, Terrence led the way and Grace followed him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for the security guards who had mocked Grace before, they were stunned.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She... she went in with Terrence?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Judging from the attitude that Terrence had towards her, he seems a little respectful towards her!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Does this woman really know Mr. Reed?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The security guards looked at each other and all broke out into a cold sweat for no reason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace followed Terrence into the elevator and went all the way to the floor of the president's office.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This floor was quiet. When they arrived at the door of the president's office, Terrence said to Grace, "Wait a minute, Miss Cummins. I'll go in and report first."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright." Grace agreed. She lowered her eyes and looked awkward as she waited quietly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence went in for a short while before coming out again, allowing Grace to enter the president's office.</p></div>
