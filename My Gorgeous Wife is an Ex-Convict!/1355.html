        <h1>Chapter 1354</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body suddenly stiffened. Her voice and embrace seemed to soothe all his uneasiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My Grace...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because of her, he felt so good... to be alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had not met her, then that was all to life. He would be nothing but an empty shell. There would not even be joy or sorrow. He would only be &lsquo;alive&rsquo; without ever experiencing the joys of life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, don't shatter my dream," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It won't be a dream. The beautiful times we have are all real. It won't be as unreal as a dream," Grace said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So Jay, your dreams won't shatter. We're just going to have more real beautiful times together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly looked up, and those eyes gazed deeply at her. Then, he lowered his head and kissed her lips deeply. "Okay, it won't be a dream anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would their future be what he imagined it to be? He only hoped that there would never be a day when his dream shattered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was only a beautiful dream for her to stay with him forever, he wanted to live in this beautiful dream until he died!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace received a phone call from Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney, saying that Lina had woken up. She rushed to the hospital immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes turned red as she looked at her best friend in the ICU through the transparent glass wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had now woken up, she could only open her eyes and give some reactions. She could hardly speak, let alone tell them how she got hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace arrived at the hospital, Lina had only woken up for a while and fell asleep again. After all, she was still too weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now that she has woken up, she'll get only get better from here on out," Grace said to Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney nodded. Mrs. Sweeney could not help crying again as she said, "You weren't here, so you didn't see her opening her mouth as soon as she woke up. She was trying so hard to say something. We had to read her lips for a long time before realizing she wanted to ask about Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We had to lie to her that Hadwin is safe, but he has a lot to deal with the Stephenson family, so he's not in Emerald City and will come back to see her in a few days. It was only then she finally calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know how Hadwin is doing right now and whether he's dead or alive. If something has happened to him, how would Lina overcome it in her current condition?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson isn't dead," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? He's not dead? Have the police found him?" Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney were immediately stirred up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... just heard someone saw him in J City, but the police haven't officially found him yet, so... Let's just wait for the police to inform us," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She deliberately omitted Hadwin Stephenson's intimacy with the &lsquo;real&rsquo; heiress of the Jackson family, not wanting Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney to be more worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, they had not figured out everything yet. No one knew what on earth was going on with Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Lina had woken up. They still had to find a way to contact Hadwin Stephenson to set Lina's mind at rest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went to see Lina the next day, she had just fallen asleep.</p></div>
