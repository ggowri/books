        <h1>Chapter 3396</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he never even considered that after getting engaged to her, he would have to do even more boring things in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he really did these things, then others would probably laugh their heads off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... Lornell looks at Chandler again and it seems like Chandler did these things without anyone from the Crypt families mocking him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned his head and looked at Harley's hopeful black eyes, suddenly feeling a bit shaken again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If we have to endure it eventually, then let's endure it sooner rather than later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who wouldn't want her to die! If she can obediently listen to him in the future, then he can tolerate it for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell's mood has finally improved slightly with some self-comfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After staying in the hospital for over a month, Harley can finally be discharged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The marriage contract of the Quentin family has also been sent to the Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda gazed at the ancient yet imposing wedding document, feeling a sense of weightiness in her heart. The document appeared very old and was written on a special type of paper that looked like neither paper nor silk. It was said to be fireproof and resistant to insects, and its color would not fade for decades.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The marriage certificate only required Harley to write his name and press his fingerprint, Samir and his wife did not appear. However, Lornell came along with the certificate and it was clear that he intended to write his name and press his fingerprint as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was no engagement ceremony in between, which actually relieved Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, along with the marriage certificate, there were also many gifts that were said to be small trinkets from the Quentin family, given to the future lady of the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Valda heard the words "future mistress of the house" from the gift-givers, she was stunned for a moment before realizing that her daughter would be the future mistress of the Quentin family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when Valda looked at the so-called "little trinkets" that were sent over, even though she had seen many precious jewels and her taste had improved over the years, she still gasped at the sight of these things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the sets consists of twelve zodiac animal figurines carved from jade, with each animal decorated with precious gems such as gold, silver, agate, and jade. The animals are carved so vividly that they look lifelike, and the craftsmanship is of a very high standard. Even though Valda is not an expert in this field, she can tell that the jade and gems used are of considerable value.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Brian's vision is much more precise. After seeing the small things that were sent over, his face couldn't help but become serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The value of these items, although the Hart family can afford them, the Quentin family's gift has two meanings. Firstly, it showcases the Quentin family's wealth, and secondly, it expresses the Quentin family's attitude towards the engagement to the Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This also means that if the Hart family wants to cancel this engagement in the future, it may not be so easy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked serious, and Valda naturally noticed her husband's unusual expression, so she asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much," Brian shook his head. "Let the two children finish the marriage contract first, so that the Quentin family's people can go back and report."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda nodded, after all, the Quentin family's messenger who delivered the marriage proposal was still waiting.</p></div>
