        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, she and her law firm colleagues had often come here to have a meal after work. For her at that time, eating here was like having a work meal.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, it had become a luxurious event that could only be enjoyed every once in a while.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She tried not to dwell on that too much.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She&rsquo;d taken many things for granted in her &lsquo;prior&rsquo; life. If she was smart, she would appreciate every little thing. Life was too fickle for anything less.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's good. I&rsquo;m glad that we&rsquo;re eating at a place you&rsquo;re familiar with. You can do the ordering then." Jason cleanly interrupted her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace ordered all the cheaper dishes, with the most expensive one being a shrimp dish.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although it wasn't a lot of money, it was already the most expensive meal Grace had had for a while.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was despite the fact that Jason kept trying to persuade her to order a little more. "I have money."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Grace still said, "This is enough. Even if it's for a good meal, there's no need to order too much."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a while, the waiter served the dishes, and they started to eat. The dishes here were naturally much better than the simple ones they usually ate at the apartment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When they started to eat the shrimp, Jason peeled them for Grace, and then put all of the shelled shrimp into her bowl.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stared at them in a daze.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong? Why aren't you eating?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled faintly and said, "I'm just thinking about how you&rsquo;re very good at taking care of people. Anyone who gets the chance to date you in the future will be very lucky." As she said this, she lifted a shrimp into her mouth.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She still remembered the times when she used to watch TV series. Once, when she had seen the male lead peeling shrimp for the female lead, she had felt very warm inside. It was a romantic gesture. The kind of small and thoughtful act that came from someone who cared about their partner.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although this was a very small act, it still gave people a feeling of being cherished, even loved.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking back, Sean had never peeled a shrimp for her. He&rsquo;d never filled her dish with the choicest pieces of food. He only pulled her chair out for her if they were at a corporate event and other people were expecting it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In fact, in hindsight, when they were dating in the past, it was obvious that although Sean said that he loved her, the feelings he had for her had not been very deep.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, they weren&rsquo;t deep, she chided herself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was why he had been able to distance himself from her so quickly after the accident!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason thought about Grace&rsquo;s words. She amused him. Thinking that he would date someone and participate in some quaint little relationship. Dating... to him, that sounded like something children did. In this life, he would probably never fall in love with any woman.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even marriage would just be a means of furthering his business.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the two of them had finished eating, Jason got up to pay the bill. Grace was about to get up as well. However, her gaze passed through the restaurant's window and she suddenly saw a few familiar figures walking toward the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She turned around subconsciously as if she didn&rsquo;t want the people to see her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, the people really walked into the restaurant. They were led by a waiter as they walked in her direction.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason watched her as he returned to the table. Her eyes darted about nervously.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, what's the matter?&rdquo; he asked her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace met his gaze for a brief second and then barreled into his body. He didn&rsquo;t think twice and just wrapped his arms around her as she slung her arms around his waist and buried her head in his chest.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason was slightly stunned. However, he did not say anything. Instead, he allowed her to hug him like that.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a long while, he asked again, "Grace?"</p></div>
