        <h1>Chapter 1755</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Five-year-old children knew what kidnapping meant. Although they were still a little hazy about it, they knew that it was a terrible thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper and Mick Reed remembered Mason. After all, they had seen him at the amusement park before, so they had an impression of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After finding out that Mason was their brother, Jasper Reed's eyes widened in surprise. She made a ruckus for quite a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed was only stunned for a moment before accepting the fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, I'll save Lil Bro." Mick Reed looked at Grace, who had a sad look on her face. He made a serious promise. He immediately regarded Mason as his younger brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Um... I'm the eldest one, so I'm responsible for protecting my younger siblings!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mick, I know your intentions, but there are already so many uncles here to save Lil Bro. You just need to stay home with your sister for a few days," said Grace as she stroked her eldest son's small head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed blinked and did not say anything more. Instead, he turned and went back to his room. Jasper followed him. Seeing the two little ones together, Grace heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Mason still occupied her head. She did not have extra energy to look after Mick and Jasper. Fortunately, she had Uncle Kwan and maids in the residence to help look after them. Hence, Grace did not have to worry too much about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed, we can&rsquo;t find Sean. The courier company he's working for said he has taken three days off. The people we sent to look into the Stevens family heard that Zoe Stevens told their neighbors that Sean has gone outstation to help collect debts. She said he would get a lot of money once he's done with the job." Terrence received the latest news and reported it to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sean..." Jason uttered the name. "I underestimated him. I never thought he would team up with Lily to do such a thing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was also stunned. Sean's involvement surprised her a little. After all, she had seen the way Sean looked at her with guilt when they were in the hospital previously, but... it turned out no amount of guilt could compete with money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Keep tracking Sean's whereabouts and look for the surveillance footage of him in tMason Swansonty in the past week. Check if he has gotten in contact with Lily," ordered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Reed group had the best tech talents in Emerald City. They could conduct a search much faster than the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, checking Sean's whereabouts in the past week might take some time&mdash;even if many of them worked together to go through the footage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said to Grace, "Go to bed. I'll take care of this. If Lily and Sean reach out, I'll let you know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace shook her head. "I'm not sleepy." All she wanted now was to get Mason back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a look of determination in her eyes that let him know she would not go to bed no matter how much he persuaded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Also, I'd like to go through Sean's surveillance footage as well. It'll be faster if we have more people go through it. I'll just feel worse if I wait around," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason then instructed his staff to give Grace a computer and some segments of the surveillance footage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With the time ticking by, Grace looked at the scenes of Sean on her computer. She had to carefully watch the surveillance footage or she might miss something.</p></div>
