        <h1>Chapter 4201</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the elevator doors opened again, Kit and Tina walked out of the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff hurriedly approached them, "Are you both alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're fine," Kit said, holding Tina's hand and bypassing the staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this city isn't big, he still feared being recognized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was recognized, if anyone took a photo of him and Tina together, then the Stephenson family and the Hunter family would probably take notice too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him now, he just wanted to continue this happiness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it's just one more day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really okay?" Tina asked worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. As long as you're with me, I'll be fine," Kit said. "Alright, let's go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two got into the car and drove back on the way they came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way back, Tina continued to talk to Kit about what they should eat tonight and her upcoming check-up tomorrow, just casual topics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Kit listened to these everyday conversations and felt how wonderful they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he and Tina were truly a family now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, suddenly, a car came out from the side, causing Tina to scream. But in that critical moment, Kit quickly turned the steering wheel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other car was about to hit Tina's side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, he couldn't let Tina get hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for himself, it didn't matter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car that Kit and Tina were in was grazed and collided with the car that came out, then crashed into the trees on the side of the road. The front of the car, where the driver's seat was, crashed heavily into the trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And until the very last moment, Kit quickly unbuckled his seat belt and threw himself towards Tina, using his body to shield her, wanting nothing more than to protect her and the baby in her belly!</span></p></div>
