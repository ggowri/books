        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe pursed her lips and smiled as she looked at a woman in the group from the corner of her eyes. She remembered that the woman had gone shopping with Grace, so she must be her friend. Although she could not vent her frustrations on Grace, she could do so to her friend!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Lina's eyes met Zoe's, she got a bad feeling.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As expected, shortly after eating dinner, Zoe toasted with everybody. As it was inconvenient for her due to her injured leg, everyone took turns to go and toast her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Lina was toasting her, Zoe deliberately shook her hand and dropped the wine glass to the floor. The wine splashed over her shoe.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Zoe said, "Even if you have no wish to toast me, you shouldn't have made me drop my wine glass. You could have told me that I was not welcome to join you for dinner and I would have left."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina stared at Zoe after hearing what she had said. The director immediately stood in front of Zoe and insisted that Lina apologize to her without finding out if it was her fault.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lina, apologize to Miss Stevens immediately!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's right. Lina, apologize immediately!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her colleagues echoed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">All of them knew that Zoe was out to make things difficult for Lina, but no one dared to offend her. She was from the Stevens Group, and they could lose their jobs if they did so.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina stood still and stared at Zoe, not saying a word.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lina, don't get us into trouble. Do you want us to lose our jobs?" the director said softly to Lina as he pulled her to the side.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina gritted her teeth and walked slowly over to Zoe. She lowered her eyelids and said, "Miss Stevens, I'm sorry. It's my fault."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe curled her lips into a smile and said, "Since you're aware that it's your fault, you should make up for it. My shoe is dirty. Clean it and I'll forget about the matter."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina stared at Zoe upon hearing those words.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe said, "I'm injured and I believe that you will not really insist upon me cleaning the shoe myself."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina's colleagues urged her to do it as well.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina had no choice but to bend down and clean Zoe's wet shoe. She knew that Zoe was taking revenge on her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, she felt glad that she was the one Zoe was taking revenge on. If she had taken revenge on Grace, Grace would have been deeply hurt by her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had been through a lot.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">All of a sudden, Zoe lifted her foot and stepped on Lina's hand. She exerted a lot of force, seeming like she wanted to crush her hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina cried out in pain. No one had been expecting Zoe to act in that manner and they were taken by surprise.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh no! I'm sorry to have stepped on you." Although Zoe was apologizing to her, she was smiling happily. She refused to remove her foot from Lina's hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina looked at her colleagues and then at Zoe before standing up suddenly.</p></div>
