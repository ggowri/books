        <h1>Chapter 847</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace called the receptionist and asked her to dispose of the roses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The receptionist divided the roses into bunches and distributed them to everyone in the company. They were free roses anyway, so many people were happy to receive them. Only Andrea Schwartz's face was gloomy as if someone owed her millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be that... Grace and Jason didn't break up? Is that why there was someone to foot the bill for her at Drunken Days and someone to send her roses today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But if they didn&rsquo;t break up, why is Grace so badly dressed? Even the bag she usually carries to work is an outdated design from several years ago! Besides, it definitely looks old!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the thought of this, Andrea Schwartz's eyes glimmered and she came up with another plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not long after, Grace was called into Lawyer Carter's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have a boyfriend?" Lawyer Carter asked straight out. After all, he said at the start of his job search that women with boyfriends or families were not eligible for the job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then those roses today..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's Curtis Row. I went to ask him for his signature the other day. He was held up by something and made me wait for a long time. I think he wanted to apologize, so that's why he sent the roses," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter was a bit surprised by the answer, but since Grace mentioned Curtis Row, it was unlikely for her to lie. Therefore, Lawyer Carter stopped asking and handed her a document.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is a vehicular crime case. Go to the parties involved and investigate the evidence as well as their testimony," said Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened it and flipped through it. It was a case about a car accident. The victim was still in a coma in the hospital, and the person who caused the accident refused to pay the compensation and kept putting it off by saying they had no money. Now, the victim's family was going to sue the perpetrator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter took the case. Of course, he was going to get to the bottom of what happened, and gathering relevant information was one of her tasks as an assistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace responded and walked out of the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon coming out, she saw Andrea Schwartz peering around. Grace did not bother to pay attention to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Andrea Schwartz saw Grace coming out with the document and looking through it after getting back to her seat, disappointment flashed in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told Lawyer Carter about the roses Grace received today during a casual chat, leading the conversation to the topic of her possibly having a boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect Grace to pass safely. 'Did she tell Lawyer Carter that she doesn&rsquo;t have a boyfriend and Lawyer Carter believes her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are Grace and Jason together?' Andrea Schwartz felt like her head was about to explode from her frustration about this question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to the hospital in the afternoon to meet the victim's family. Her clients were the victim's parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To Grace's surprise, she met Chase Harper in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that the victim was an employee at Chase Harper's dealership and had been in a coma for more than a month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew from the victim's parents that Chase Harper often came to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After collecting relevant information, Grace and Chase Harper left the hospital together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect you to be Baldwin's lawyer," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not really. I'm just a paralegal now." Although she had a lawyer's license, her current job was only to assist lawyers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll be a barrister sooner or later! I watched the news and know that you've reversed your case. You were wronged back then. Congratulations on your vindication," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Poor Baldwin. He's a fine young man who&rsquo;s now stuck in the hospital. His parents might not have been compelled to seek a lawyer if it hadn't been for the staggering daily medical bills and the perpetrator's delays in paying them compensation. You can also call me if you have any questions about the case." Chase Harper sighed.</p></div>
