        <h1>Chapter 1333</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn did not expect Paisley Daniels to show up in front of her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dressed in designer haute couture, Paisley Daniels looked dignified and poised. She was just like a rich madam. There was a smile of triumph on that delicate face of hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, we meet again. Speaking of which, I thought you were going to go all out in suing Martin, but you unexpectedly gave up custody before the lawsuit even started. What's the matter? Are you trying to get more out of this by giving up custody?" Paisley Daniels stood in front of the food stall and looked at Kyla Corbyn mockingly as if she was looking at a loser.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn slowly looked up. "Is that all you came here to tell me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course not. I also want to tell you that Martin and I will be getting married in three months. Once you hand the child to Martin in three months, I'll take 'good' care of him." Paisley Daniels stressed the word &lsquo;good&rsquo;, but one could hear the threat in it right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn narrowed her eyes and stared at her coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels said with a smile on the corners of her lips, "Although you made me miscarry, the child is still Martin's child, after all. I'm not someone who holds grudges, so I'll treat the child kindly and raise him well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She might be saying such words, but the look in her eyes told a different story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn glared at Paisley Daniels and said, "Paisley Daniels, you and I know exactly what had happened. You can harm me because Martin Weiss doesn't care about me, but do you think you can harm Nelson? He's Martin Weiss's flesh and blood. Can Martin Weiss tolerate you laying a hand on Nelson? Do you really think he's that stupid?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's expression froze. For a moment, she did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Believe it or not, if one day Nelson gets hurt because of you, will Martin Weiss forsake you or his flesh and blood?" Kyla Corbyn continued saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Paisley Daniels clenched her teeth in hatred and said, "Kyla Corbyn, your son is nothing but a disabled child. Do you think Martin Weiss would care about a disabled son? So what if I can't conceive? I can get surrogate mothers to give Martin a baby and I'll raise it! Your disabled son is just a burden to the Weiss family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;disabled&rsquo;... stung Kyla Corbyn's heart. She was framed and sent to prison by Paisley Daniels. She had a fever in prison and had to take cold medicine to reduce her fever. However, the medicine was not suitable for pregnant women at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no choice back then. If the fever had continued, she could have lost the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only bite the bullet and take the medicine. The cold medicine was even given to her by a fellow inmate who took pity on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had not had a fever and taken the medicine, Nelson's hearing would not have been impaired. He would have been a healthy child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Only you would regard this disabled son as treasure. Do you think Martin cares about him? Martin is fighting you for the child just because he doesn't want a woman like you to raise a child of his blood. Your disabled son can get lost once Martin has another son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels continued to speak in her malicious voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn suddenly raised her hand and slapped her right on the face. "Paisley Daniels, if you dare talk about my son like that again, I'll give you hell!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stared at her angrily. She was throwing caution to the wind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels covered one cheek in disbelief. "How... How dare you slap me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why wouldn't I? You're lucky I didn't slash you with a knife after what you've done to me. Or do you want to experience what it's like to be slashed?" Kyla Corbyn said coldly.</p></div>
