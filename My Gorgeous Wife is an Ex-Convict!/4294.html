        <h1>Chapter 4292 Why</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at Tina in shock, "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, I want to have another child with you to remove the curse of the witch on you!" she said, "Of course, it would be through artificial means, in a reliable hospital. The technology for artificial conception and childbirth is quite advanced nowadays."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is also the safest and most feasible method!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a decision she had thought about for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to her surprise, he directly refused, "I don't need it!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was shocked this time: "Why isn't it necessary? Wasn't it because of the Gu worms that you were in such pain? You even planned to take the risk of asking the Quentin family to help you lure out the Gu worms!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her and asked, "Do you love me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Tina was stunned, never expecting him to suddenly ask such a question.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you love me?" Chandler repeated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pursed her lips and hesitated for a moment before saying, "You know, I lost my memory, so I don't have the same feelings for you as before."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you don't love me now, right?" he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," she replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze became dim, and even though he knew that her lack of love was the answer, hearing her give a definite response still pierced his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You once said that a child should be the product of two people in love, not born to save someone's life," Chandler said. "Moreover, what kind of criticism will this child face if born? The child will be born after we divorce, and it will inevitably attract rumors. And if the child grows up and knows the reason for their birth was not because their parents loved each other, how will they feel?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler sighed and continued, "Quinn has faced our divorce since birth, and there are too many things that cannot be changed. I feel guilty towards Quinn for not being able to give her a complete family. So, if we know we can't provide a complete family for the child but still choose to have them, it would be too cruel for the child!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he would never agree to this matter, no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if the child knows they were born to save their own father, maybe they won't think as you said. Even if we divorce, you will definitely be a good father to the child!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler said bitterly, "Tina, I don't plan to have a child with you using this method and for this reason."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then do you plan to die? Or do you plan to bear a great cost when the Gu worms are lured out? Maybe your body will collapse, maybe you'll be disabled. Have you thought about the consequences?!" Tina shouted anxiously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't die. Even if there may be some cost when the Gu worms are lured out, it won't be too terrible. You can rest assured," he said calmly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't want to see you suffer, I don't want to see anything bad happen to you!" she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her, "Why? You should hate me, because I've been deceiving you all along, hiding the truth about the curse and the insects, that's why I've been by your side. You filed for divorce because you couldn't bear the deception, right? So why now, would you rather have a child with me, than see me in trouble?"</span></p></div>
