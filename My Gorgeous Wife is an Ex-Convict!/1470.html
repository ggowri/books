        <h1>Chapter 1469</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Misunderstanding... If possible, I&rsquo;d hope it's a misunderstanding as well. If only Jay had no idea who was the culprit and no tunneling was involved!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace fell asleep at night, Jason walked into the ward as usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This was the only time he could look at her and stay beside her for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Did she know how precious moments like this were to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as his hand was about to gently push the strands of hair away from her cheeks, her eyes suddenly opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Their eyes met, and he suddenly stiffened. His expression instantly changed, and he almost stepped back in a panic. He turned around, wanting to leave the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knew she did not want to see him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though he had stayed outside the ward every day, she never once mentioned wanting to see him. She would even rather stay in the hospital than go back to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knew she was afraid she would inevitably see him after going back to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, just after he took a few steps, her voice rang out in the ward. "Wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stopped in his tracks, hardly able to believe what he had heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did she say... wait?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did I hear it wrong? Or...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he dared not look back for fear that what he heard was not that at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jason, let's talk," said Grace. Just as Kyla had said, some things would not be solved if she kept avoiding them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason felt a pang in his heart. Instead of calling him &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;, she called out his full name. Her voice was still gentle, but it seemed to carry a sense of alienation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," he said as he turned around slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No one dared to offend Master Reed, the man who ruled Emerald City. However, he seemed to be at a loss in front of her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at the man who was standing just a few steps away from her. She had also heard from Kyla that he would come in to see her every night when she was asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Can you tell me how&hellip; Lily was the murderer? Did she cause Jennifer's death intentionally, or was it unintentional?" she asked about her doubts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This was the question that flashed through her mind from time to time these days, even if she tried not to think about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's lips trembled and he answered, "Yes... It was intentional. The Atkinson family had chosen Jennifer as their successor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What Jason said instantly made Grace understand that if Jennifer was the successor, it meant that most of the Atkinson family's wealth would be Jennifer's in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Lily was the second heiress of the Atkinson family, the wealth she could get might be limited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not uncommon for the rich and powerful to compete for wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So I was just the unlucky fellow who coincidentally ran into Jennifer's car?" murmured Grace.</p></div>
