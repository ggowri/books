        <h1>Chapter 124</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This reporter seems unaware that Miss Cummins has been imprisoned before. He only knows her name and reckons that he can write a tabloid article about you," Terrence said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason said coldly, "Continue to interrogate him. Release him only after you've got all the information you need from him. He mentioned that he saw someone post about this on social media. Go and find out who saw it and who mentioned it!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Got it," Terrence replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Jason pushed open the door to the ward and saw Grace eating her porridge, he wondered if the reporter had chanced upon the news concerning the two of them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Was it a coincidence that we were discovered the night before, or... was there something else?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace lifted her head and saw that Jason's face had darkened. He seemed unhappy, so she stared at him in amazement.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, the unhappy aura around him disappeared. A smile broke out on his handsome face and he began behaving as usual.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, why are you staring at me?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">With some difficulty, she shook her head and replied, "Oh, it's nothing."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In that brief moment, Grace had felt as if she did not recognize him. "Could it be that... this is his true self?" When he smiled at her, he looked like an angel, but it could all just be an act.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ever since Zoe had found out that Jason was the man behind Grace, she had been down on her luck.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That meant that she could not get back at the person who had hurt her leg!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had been mocked in her social group when they found out that she had been admitted to the hospital because someone had broken her leg. If she could not recover from her leg injuries, she would be mocked for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt that it was Grace's fault. If not for her, she wouldn't be in such a state.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Grace had gotten together with Jason, she had kept quiet about it. Zoe suspected that Grace had done it deliberately. She had pretended to be in a disadvantageous position in order to trick her into dealing with her. After that, she had gotten Jason to avenge her!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more Zoe thought about that, the angrier she became.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This day, her friends booked a private room for her to kill her boredom. However, she was unable to enjoy herself as she had to walk around with a crutch.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Zoe left the private room on her crutch, she saw a group of people walking toward her. One of them looked familiar to her!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the man walking at the head of the group saw her, he cracked a smile. He immediately walked over to her and said, "Miss Stevens, I'm surprised to see you here. Have you injured your leg? Ah, we should have visited you..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man rattled on, trying to fawn over her, but Zoe could not recall who he was. Finally, he said, "I'm the director of FY Secondary Design Research Institute. We have business dealings with the Stevens Group. I have seen Miss Stevens a couple of times at your Group's gatherings."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Zoe could not remember if she had met him before, she knew about the Fangyan Design Research Institute. It was a small design research institute. As the boss and one of the relatives of the Stevens Group knew each other, there were times when the Stevens Group would let them take some design jobs which were not as important.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you having a gathering? Can I join you since I'm free?" Zoe suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the director heard that, he was overjoyed. He said excitedly, "Of course... no problem. It'd be great if you could join us!"</p></div>
