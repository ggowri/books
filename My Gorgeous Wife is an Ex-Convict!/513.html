        <h1>Chapter 512</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car arrived at the venue of the banquet, Jason walked in while holding Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, hundreds of eyes were focused on Grace. After all, Jason would always be in the center of attention, and as everyone in Emerald City knew, this was the first time Jason had a woman next to him in more than three years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Jennifer Atkinson, who attended several public occasions with Jason previously, was never seen holding his hand. However, Jason had been holding Grace&rsquo;s hand ever since they entered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Quite a few of Emerald City's socialites attended the banquet today. Most of them knew about Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, although Jason was famous for being celibate in Emerald City and had not been romantically involved with anyone since Jennifer Atkinson's death, these ladies were still eager to try and approach him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no one dared to take the first step. After all, it was no secret in their circle how badly a woman would end up if she played tricks to get close to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the very least, they thought that Jason was still single. However, now there was a woman next to him. They were behaving intimately too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one knew exactly who the woman was, but her outfit looked so imposing that several socialites had already recognized Grace's gown to be a limited edition garment from a brand that ordinary people could not afford. Only the highest-ranking VIPs were eligible to buy a gown like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It made these people envious and jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Jason around and watched him chat with some of Emerald City's gentry. He introduced her, "This is my girlfriend, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This simple sentence carried a lot of weight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's introduction confirmed Grace's identity, so to speak. No one in Emerald City's high society would dare to look down on Grace from now on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was another faint uproar in the direction of the banquet's entrance. Grace turned around only to see two figures coming in. They were immediately surrounded by others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew both of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian and her half-sister, Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, it had been some time since she had seen Evelyn. She had only seen some of Evelyn's gossip when she read the news online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the news, everyone could see that Evelyn had good resources now since Brian was helping her out. Many people were even speculating that Evelyn might date Brian for no more than three months before she was dumped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, three months later, Evelyn was still Brian's girlfriend. This slapped those onlookers in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, some people on the internet said that the entertainment industry's crown prince was finally captured by Cinderella. Evelyn had also gained popularity from this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, Evelyn looked quite like an actress, dressed in a dark red evening gown and with her red lipstick on. Brian, who was beside her, was dressed in a navy blue suit. His handsome face was still a little indifferent, exuding an air of alienation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the crown prince had been changing girlfriends one after another and giving people the impression of a playboy, judging from just his appearance, no one would consider a man like him a playboy.</p></div>
