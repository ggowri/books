        <h1>Chapter 1841</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah. Dr. Russell said it's because it didn't heal properly at the time, so it became harder to walk as she got older," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she spoke, she saw Jason's face turning paler and paler. She said, "What's come over you? Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I..." He drew a long breath, raised his hand to rub his temples. "Go to bed first. I suddenly remember that I have some unfinished business to attend to. I'll work on them in my study."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he hurried out of the room and into the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason instantly closed the study door and leaned his back against it as soon as he walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He recalled the conversation with Secretary Wang in the detention center. At that time, Secretary Wang had also mentioned one thing... "By the way, Young Master, haven't you been looking for your mother? Here's a tip. After your father died, Old master Reed found your mother and had someone cut one of her hamstrings. Old master Reed intended to cripple your mother, but she was lucky and escaped..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Could the cut hamstring in one leg... be a coincidence?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, the woman did not look like the woman he remembered. There was not even a trace of his mother in her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... he was going to investigate her either way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could only be at ease once he had investigated her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Walking over to his desk, Jason took out his phone and called Terrence. "Terrence, I want you to help me to investigate someone. I want to know all about her history. Besides that..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once the call ended, Jason stared darkly at his chest. Beneath his clothes, there was a scar on his chest. Even after so many years, the scar was still there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His mother had given it to him... back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If possible, he did not want Mrs. Watts to be... that woman! If she was, then it would be a terrible situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he still had to find out no matter what. He had long ago made up his mind to find the woman who abandoned her husband and son to make her pay for everything she did!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After four days in the hospital, Lina could finally be discharged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her baby was safe for now. However, according to the doctor, she had better stay at home and rest in bed for the next three months. She also had to take her prescribed progesterone shots at the community health center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina went back to her office after she was discharged from the hospital and applied for a sabbatical leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The director called her into his office. "Are you really pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, I'm pregnant. My baby is unstable, so the doctor told me to stay in bed as much as possible during the next three months. Sorry, I know my pregnancy has brought trouble to the design office," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, she worked in a small design office. If she took a sabbatical, her colleagues would have to take on extra work to make up for her absence. If they hired someone else, the new hire would be placed in an awkward position when she returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll try to handle the projects you have on hand. You're an old employee, so I won't give you a hard time. You can ask for a sabbatical, but you need to finish some work at home," the director said cheerfully.</p></div>
