        <h1>Chapter 3326</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda wearily opened her eyes and gazed at the small, rosy face before her. She couldn't help but find it adorable, and a strange feeling welled up from within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is... their child, born from the bloodline of both her and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A little life has been born, it truly feels miraculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the help of the nurse, Valda gently kissed her daughter's cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, the nurse showed it to Brian, who had just become a father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After glancing at Brian, he became even more nervous about Valda's situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The baby was carried out by the nurse, while Valda had to stay in the delivery room for about two more hours for postpartum observation to ensure everything was okay before leaving the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The nurses carried the children outside to show their waiting relatives and then took them for cleaning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt like her body had fallen apart at this moment, while Brian was by her side, helping her tidy up her messy hair. "I'm sorry for causing you so much pain," he said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After witnessing her go through such immense pain to give birth to their child, he realized that he had underestimated the difficulty of childbirth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Assuming that all the indicators and data from her prenatal check-ups were good, they thought that giving birth would be smooth sailing and didn't think much of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in reality, the pain is so severe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he, faced with her pain, feels so helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if he wanted to take her pain away, he couldn't do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's there to apologize for? Giving birth is always painful, and it's not like I'm the only one experiencing it," Valda said. "Besides, everything is going smoothly now, right? There are no complications or need for a C-section."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It can be said that compared to Grace and Lina, Kyla had a much smoother childbirth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..." Valda looked at Brian's pale face and said, "You must have been very worried and scared all this time. It must have been very hard for you. Do you know how pale your face is right now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spoke and made an effort to lift her hand, reaching towards his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For her now, even lifting her hand has become very difficult, her arms are very sore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even so, she still wanted to... touch him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hand touched his face and she felt the coldness of his cheek. "Brian, I worried you," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lifted his hand and held hers, saying, "As long as you're safe, that's all that matters."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her gaze fell on his hand, which had obvious bruises and scratches. "Your hand..." she exclaimed involuntarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hesitated for a moment, then quickly said, "It's nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda guessed, "I scratched you during childbirth?" recalling the scene of giving birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, she only remembered holding his hand and using all her strength to give birth to the child. She didn't know how much strength she had used.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the marks on his hand now, she could imagine how much strength she had used.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While she was in pain giving birth, he was also in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not only mentally, but physically too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda gently took Brian's hand and said, "You must be in pain too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Compared to your pain, this pain is nothing," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, we went through the pain together and gave birth to the child," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was slightly taken aback by her words, feeling that they sounded a bit strange, but he replied, "Whatever you say."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The couple smiled at each other, and with the addition of their daughter, they knew they would become even happier in the future.</p></div>
