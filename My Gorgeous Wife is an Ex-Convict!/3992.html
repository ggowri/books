        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason raised an eyebrow slightly. "So, are you planning to tell your mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The look in his eyes was both a warning and a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick knew that when it came to anything about their mother, his father could completely disregard everyone else, including himself and his siblings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For his father, the most important thing in the world was his mother, and everything else was secondary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though his mother knew some of his father's dark side, his father still tried to show only the bright side and didn't want his mother to see his cruel side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't tell my mother," Mick said. "So, father, please don't interfere in the matter between Nancy and me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As a father, I just want to remind you that if you really can't let go of this relationship, it's not impossible to keep it. As long as you can firmly control the other person in your hands, that person will stay with you for a lifetime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if she doesn't love me?" Mick sneered. "There's no need to force someone who doesn't love me to stay by my side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing his parents' love, he didn't want to force someone to stay with him just for the sake of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, he had his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Nancy didn't love him wholeheartedly and had ulterior motives, he would rather not have her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Jason smiled knowingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will let go of my feelings for her and not let her affect me in any way," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letting go of his feelings for Nancy was not a difficult thing for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Mick returned to the hotel where Nancy used to work, his emotions were still affected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said she had quit, so he shouldn't run into her today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why did he still think of her when she wasn't around?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouldn't think about this woman anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason he had been with her that day was to convince himself that she was just a woman, nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a transaction between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it was a transaction, there was no need for any emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love or hate, there was no need for either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who invited him here today was someone who had business dealings with the Reed family in Emerald City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people were trying their best to please him, but he still lacked enthusiasm, as if he couldn't get excited about anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this also be the influence of Nancy on him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a beautiful woman approached Mick with a glass of wine and said, "Mr. Reed, would you like a drink? I haven't seen you drink tonight! If Mr. Reed has any troubles, I'm willing to share them with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's eyes were full of suggestive meaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick stared at the glass in the woman's hand, but didn't take it. Instead, he suddenly asked, "Do you like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" The woman was stunned, clearly not expecting such a sudden question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But regardless, this is an opportunity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it's an opportunity, it must be seized firmly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I like you." The woman immediately confessed, her beautiful face flushed with excitement. "Ever since I met you, I've been thinking about you. As long as it's you, I'm willing to do anything for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she struck a more charming pose.</span></p></div>
