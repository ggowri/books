        <h1>Chapter 2848</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I'll ever take back what I&rsquo;ve given away?" Brian asked rhetorically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Thank you for the gifts... then. By the way, the comic fiesta is next week. The magazine will be holding a small book signing for me. Will you be free to stop by after the book signing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Comic fiesta?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The comic fiesta venue doesn't close until 10 o&rsquo;clock, so we can take a look around until then. Of course, I'll just look around myself after the book signing if you're unavailable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had often attended comic fiestas by herself. If Camille were free, she would take Camille with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she wanted to check out the comic fiesta with him. It was as if she wanted him to get to know her hobbies, and it would be great if he liked them too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I understand. Let me know the specific time and address," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller instantly had a bright smile when she heard the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused slightly when he saw her smile. 'When did I start to enjoy seeing her smile more and more...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After dinner, Brian went downstairs and drove off alone. A figure slowly emerged from a hidden corner when the car pulled out of the apartment compound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a face 80 percent similar to Grace's. Even her hair and dressing were similar to Grace's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Brian were still around, he would be able to recall the woman's name... Whitney Cooper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Whitney Cooper's beautiful face was twisted due to jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had saved her from poverty and gave her hope when she was abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kept her around as his secretary but never let her get near him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She later learned about Grace and knew that the woman was the person Brian loved. She also understood why Brian saved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she tried hard to be more like Grace, even if she was just a substitute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But why... Why does Brian have a girlfriend now, but that girlfriend isn't me? The woman named Valda Theller is nothing like Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Remembering how Brian had told her to go to a company branch overseas and warned her not to overthink, Whitney Cooper's heart churned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all right if Brian did not love others for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not accept him falling in love with someone else!</p></div>
