        <h1>Chapter 2762</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was still stuck in the film, unable to get over it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought about it and said, "It's just a movie. Don't be too upset. Besides, the little white dragon finally repaid his gratitude. He has some regrets but is also content."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it just a movie?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked. "Isn't it a movie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly smiled. "Yeah, it's just a movie. It's just that the little white dragon is so stupid. He made so many stupid mistakes. How could there be such a stupid character?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His smile somehow made her heart ache. He was smiling, but she had a feeling that he was about to cry again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "There&rsquo;s no one who never makes mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. Nobody is perfect, and I don't think the little white dragon is stupid. He's just too persistent in repaying his gratitude. He just wants to repay the girl who saved him so much that the villain used him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyelashes quivered slightly. 'Persistent... Yeah, many people have said that I'm too persistent.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The persistence became an obsession. After all those years, the obsession became a habit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If that girl could have recognized the little white dragon earlier and told him that she was the girl he was looking for, maybe the little white dragon wouldn&rsquo;t have missed out on her. Hopefully, the little white dragon didn't disappear. I hope he&rsquo;ll have a happy ending."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ending could only be said to be happy yet regretful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian&rsquo;s breathing paused as he looked blankly at the woman in front of him. "Do you think the little white dragon can have a happy ending?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, &ldquo;I can imagine that the dragon will have a happy ending. Maybe there&rsquo;ll be a sequel in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two people walked out of the theater. Valda Theller walked as she told Brian many jokes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are they not funny? I told you so many jokes," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're funny," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him suspiciously. "Do you really think they&rsquo;re funny? Then why aren't you laughing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to see me laugh?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why would I tell you jokes if I don't want to see you laugh? I just thought that movie had put you in a bad mood, so I wanted you to feel better.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, a smile slowly appeared on Brian's lips. "Valda, thank you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His original gloomy mood had gradually faded because of her statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said that the little white dragon was not stupid but too persistent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She also said she hoped the little white dragon could have a happy ending.</p></div>
