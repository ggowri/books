        <h1>Chapter 2969</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment his parents walked into the room, he woke up and almost instinctively put his index finger to his lips, making a gesture for them to be quiet, not wanting them to wake her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Next, he tried to keep his voice down during the conversation with his parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mother teased him, "You spoil her so much? It's already morning and you still don't want to wake her up. When will you spoil me, the mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You are naturally spoiled by father," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then his parents looked at him in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He understood what they were surprised about. In the past, he probably wouldn't have even responded to his mother's words, at most just giving her a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that spending time with Valda had made him talk more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, for the first time in his life, with his girlfriend lying next to him, he sat on the bed and chatted with his parents for half an hour until her phone alarm went off and she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, what should I say when I meet your parents later?" Valda worriedly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can say anything, or if you don't want to say anything, I can say it for you," Brian said, patting her head. Because she had just woken up, her hair was still down and she looked like a doll. "Okay, you go wash up first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words seemed to remind her, and she quickly got out of bed and rushed into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the way, we can't let them wait for too long. Otherwise, their impression of her might become even worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing her morning routine, Valda changed into a fresh white dress, hoping to make a good impression on the old Mr. and Mrs. Hart. However, when she saw Brian, he was also wearing a white shirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It looks like they are wearing matching outfits, almost like couple's clothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go. I've had the servant prepare breakfast. We'll go downstairs and have breakfast first." Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, what about your parents..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's okay, they won't be idle naturally," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, while they were having breakfast, the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart sat in the living room, looking at Valda's comic books.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda whispered to Brian, "How did you get my comic here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course I bought them. I wanted to learn more about you, so I bought all the comics you've drawn over the years," replied Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But your parents, they are currently looking at... my comics, which are all love stories," she said, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she draws cartoons for children or military and historical themes, she feels more comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, it's a romantic girl's comic...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda is feeling quite battered now, one wave after another, and it seems like each wave is stronger than the last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda quickly finished breakfast and hurriedly pulled Brian to the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello Uncle and Aunt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you eaten well?" asked Mrs. Hart, the elderly woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mmm, I'm done eating," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please have a seat first, we can chat slowly while sitting," said Mrs. Hart with a smiling face.</p></div>
