        <h1>Chapter 2025</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, in the news earlier, it was reported that the president of Stephenson Group had said that the baby in Lina's belly would be Stephenson Group's future heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The film crew would be in trouble if anything happened to the baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, they did not expect another tall and handsome man to come over with Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When some of the bodyguards saw Jason, they immediately shouted, "Young master Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Young master Reed... Not many people in Emerald City would be addressed as that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the film crew looked at Jason's aristocratic appearance, someone instantly thought of a man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Could this... be Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After hearing Grace shout &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;, the crowd could confirm their guesses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It was indeed... Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason approached Grace. "Were you hurt? If you wanted an autograph, you could&rsquo;ve just asked me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm not hurt. Someone just bumped into me," said Grace before smiling. "I just found out today that the TV drama I'm following is being filmed here. I just got an autograph and took a photo."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh? Have you been binge-watching TV dramas lately? What is it called? What is it about?" Jason seemed to ask nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace immediately froze. 'Gosh, I accidentally spilled the beans. The title's fine, but what about its content?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was silent for a while, hesitating what to say when Hadwin Stephenson said quietly, "The drama is called Old Friends. It's a love story between two men."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The expression on Jason's face froze slightly. Even though he had always been calm, he could not help feeling surprised. His peach blossom eyes stared at Grace. "Do you like such shows?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The plot is actually... not bad. Well... I only watch it occasionally," Grace said meekly. For some reason, she felt a little guilty under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Gosh, what am I feeling guilty about? It's not like I'm watching those shows with prejudice!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"This show is innocent. Hadwin, didn't you watch the show with me? Tell Jason, lest he misunderstands," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson immediately felt his headache intensify. 'Does this woman want me to recommend Jason such a show?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He glanced at Lina sideways. "I heard that you asked the men I assigned to you for the crew's filming schedule. Did you come here after seeing the schedule?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina chuckled drily. "I only came over to have a look. I wasn't really sure but it turns out that they&rsquo;re really filming here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then what did you do besides asking for autographs?" asked Hadwin Stephenson as he vaguely glanced at the film crew members nearby. To no surprise, he saw the leading actors. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He might not be able to recognize other celebrities, but he could recognize the two leading actors. Lina kept praising these two male actors in front of him, saying how handsome they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Handsome... Do I have to do what Jason said last time? Do I have to try hard to enchant Lina so that she&rsquo;ll keep her eyes on me?'</p></div>
