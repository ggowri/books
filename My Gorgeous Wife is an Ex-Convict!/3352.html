        <h1>Chapter 3350</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it seems that no one has ever pursued her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was always her pursuing others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thinking about?" Brian's voice suddenly sounded in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda snapped out of her thoughts and saw Brian standing next to her in a bathrobe, with slightly damp hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll help you dry your hair," she said, picking up the towel next to him and proactively helping him wipe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he naturally bent down, matching her sitting height.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Has the child eaten well?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I think she'll fall asleep soon," Valda said. Babies at this stage tend to fall asleep quickly even if they wake up briefly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At that moment, she fell asleep. You should also go to bed early, as you will need to wake up in the middle of the night." Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, what were you thinking just now?" Brian brought the conversation back to the previous question, as he noticed you seemed lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was just thinking... I wonder how many boys will pursue our daughter in the future," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if she wants to pursue a relationship, it will be a long time from now. Anyway, before she goes to college, she is not allowed to date." When Brian thought about his precious daughter being taken away by some guy in the future, he felt inexplicably depressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Before college, no dating?" Valda was taken aback. "When did you develop this idea?" She had always thought Brian was the type with a more open-minded educational philosophy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, unexpectedly, there was this particular aspect in his approach to educating his children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After having a daughter," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was a bit speechless and asked, "What if my daughter really likes someone and wants to date them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, children nowadays are more mature in their thinking compared to back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Furthermore, at that time, many people were already dating in high school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although high school romance may not be as direct as adult relationships, the hazy feeling it brings is actually quite beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, Valda enjoys watching youth campus dramas herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And in the comics she likes, there are several classic school-themed ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If we must talk, then let's talk under my supervision," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So how are we supposed to talk about this?" Valda laughed and cried at the same time. If that's the case, the child will be very uncomfortable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Valda feels a bit sympathetic towards her future daughter's love life. If she really meets someone she likes, that person must be able to withstand the treatment of a future father-in-law like her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If our daughter grows up like Tina, Jasper, or Veronica, having a childhood sweetheart and all, what will you do then? Will you monitor her too?" Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That would require her to truly have talent, I never planned on having a future son-in-law so soon," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin can now understand his feelings a bit more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, speaking of which, why did Chandler know that Tina was a girl when she was still in Lina's belly? And why did he insist on adopting the baby after saving Lina's life? What was the Hunter family thinking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Hunter family naturally hoped that Tina could marry Chandler smoothly," said Brian. "Every year on Tina's birthday, the gifts sent by the Hunter family were very valuable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Hunter very mysterious? I heard he's from the Crypt families!" said Valda. This rumor, of course, came from Lina's mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda doesn't have much knowledge about the Crypt families, and Lina's explanation wasn't clear enough, so she didn't understand it even more.</p></div>
