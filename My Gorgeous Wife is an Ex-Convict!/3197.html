        <h1>Chapter 3195</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you serious?" Valda blinked her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course it's true. If you want to see it, then what's the harm in me making a movie or TV show about it?" he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip slightly and after some thought, said, "Let's forget it. Although I really want to watch it, if you act in it, there will be a female lead who acts alongside you. Seeing you fall in love with the female lead in the drama, I might get jealous. So... it's better not to film it. Just thinking about it is enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you get jealous?" he asked with great interest. Come to think of it, he hardly ever saw her display any jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Valda said, "I'm not a saint, so of course I get jealous! Even if I know that there's nothing going on between you and the other person, if I see you acting intimately, I still feel jealous and uncomfortable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled slightly and said, "Don't worry, there shouldn't be any chance for you to feel jealous in the future, although... I actually kind of want to see what you would look like when you're jealous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was speechless for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The hot topic about wedding photos has indeed risen to the top. The photo shoot for the wedding photos has been going on for several days now. Due to Valda's leg condition, Brian has been considerate and only shoots one scene per day, fearing that she might get too tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This afternoon, Valda was pulled to do her makeup again. She was a bit puzzled and asked Brian, "Didn't we finish shooting already?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We still have a set of night scene photos to take tonight. Once we finish that, it will be officially completed," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Night scene?" Valda was confused. "Where are we going to take the night scene?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll know when we get there," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Valda finished her makeup, changed her clothes, and sat in the car, following Brian to the shooting location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only when she arrived did she realize that it was the amusement park they had visited together before. It was already old-fashioned in tMason Swansonty, but it held many memories for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were memories of her playing here with her parents when she was young, memories of him sneaking here with his classmates when he was young, and memories of them coming here together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This place is not open at night," Valda reminded him. It closed at 5:30 pm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know. It's precisely because it's not open to the public at night that it's convenient for taking photos," he said, holding her hand and walking towards the amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The amusement park at night was so different from during the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right now, the amusement park is very quiet and there are no visitors. However, all the lights are on, illuminating the amusement facilities, creating a peaceful atmosphere after the hustle and bustle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment of confusion, Valda finally caught up and responded slowly, "Did you rent the whole place?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, it's not difficult to rent out the amusement park at night. How about taking a set of photos here?" Brian suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great!" Valda responded. She never thought she would experience a theme park buyout scene like in a TV show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the amusement park, the staff for taking wedding photos were also ready, so the shooting began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to the fact that it was a private booking, the situation was quite ideal and there were not many people to disturb us. The filming process went smoothly as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, because there were many picturesque spots in the amusement park and it held many memories for Valda, she couldn't resist asking for more photos to be taken.</p></div>
