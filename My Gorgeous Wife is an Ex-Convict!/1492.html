        <h1>Chapter 1490-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">II</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang spoke as if he was not concerned, "I worked for Old Master Reed when I was penniless, and he saved my life. Now that the old master is gone, of course, I'll do whatever he told me to do. Young Master, I've already told you what I should. I won't tell you what I shouldn't. You'll find out when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips tightly. He knew Secretary Wang well. Among the people around the old master, Secretary Wang was the most loyal to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What did the old master... tell him to do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'A bet?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grandpa's dead now, yet he still wanted to bet whether I'd give up my life for a woman? How is Grandpa going to bet me on this? Whatever the bet, the woman involved... is Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace?' Jason suddenly shuddered as he thought of something. Suddenly, he took out his phone and dialed Grace's phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, there was no answer from the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's face immediately turned grim. Terrence also seemed to realize something and said quickly, "Master Reed..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Contact the people at the residence immediately and ask them to ascertain Grace's status. Also, enhance the security near the bedroom," ordered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes!" Terrence replied immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He hurriedly took his phone to call the mansion's chief of security and began to give orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, moments later, Terrence's face suddenly paled. He panicked and said to Jason urgently, "Oh no, Master Reed! Young Madam is missing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What?" Jason suddenly grabbed Terrence's phone and asked the person on the other end of the line sternly, "What's the matter? Where's Young Madam? Is she no longer in the residence?"</p></div>
