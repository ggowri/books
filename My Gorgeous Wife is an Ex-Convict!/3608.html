        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words actually amused him, leaving him both laughing and crying, "Usually, it's men who say things like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Women can also speak, no one has said that men can't lean on women and cry," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fell on her delicate face, yes, when he was a child, he used to cry leaning on her shoulder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She is still like she was when she was a child, as if she has never been tainted by the filth of this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the waiter served the dishes, and they started eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While eating, Jasper asked, "Do you have any idea who posted the thread on the forum?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William shook his head, "I have no clue for now. It could be targeted at me, or someone who has a grudge against the Barlow family. After all, the Barlow family has always had some rivals in the business world! And as for me... some people, even if they appear friendly on the surface, who knows what they truly think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True," Jasper agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll have a computer expert look into the IP information of that post on the forum, see if we can find the person who posted it!" William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suddenly hesitated, "Um, well... it might not be convenient to access the forum right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" William asked, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered, "I asked my eldest brother to hack the forum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, William was speechless. He knew Mick's skills, and hacking a campus forum was a piece of cake for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll have a computer expert contact Mick later to see if we can track down the person who posted this," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Jasper nodded and then looked at William somewhat apologetically. "Do you think I'm interfering too much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No." He looked at her with tender eyes. "And, I would be glad because that means you want to protect me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at his smiling face, feeling her heart pounding intensely, as if it wanted to leap out of her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing their meal, the two of them returned to school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William accompanied Jasper back to the girls' dormitory. However, the sight of them walking side by side attracted the attention of many passing students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper could clearly feel that there were more gazes on them today than usual!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when William took her downstairs, they happened to run into her roommate, Meave, who was also returning to the dormitory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meave looked at William standing next to Jasper, with a somewhat surprised expression on her face, and then smiled, "William, you brought Jasper back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm." William replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have no idea how worried Jasper was about you. After the class today, he saw the post on the forum and rushed out to find you..." Meave said, realizing that she was being too talkative again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like she was stirring up trouble for herself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, William didn't seem to mind Meave mentioning the post, he just smiled slightly at Jasper and said, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh... why are you thanking me!" Jasper looked embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for worrying about me." he said, then reached out and touched her head, "It's getting late now, go upstairs and rest soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should rest early too." she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." he replied.</span></p></div>
