        <h1>Chapter 256</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were ripples in his eyes, and they revealed some sort of gentleness that seemed to say he could put up with her no matter what she did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The light in his eyes and the smile at the corners of his lips were indescribably beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly realized that she was being silly. Even though she had ordered all the dishes on the menu, it was still nothing to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was wrong with her? She was taking out her anger in such a silly way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Frustrated, Grace dispiritedly handed the menu back to the waiter and said, "That's all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that all?" Jason said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip for a moment before saying, "That's all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you finish them? There are enough for seven or eight of you. Isn't it a little too much for you two?" the waiter said tactfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lightly said, "That's all for now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The waiter took the menu and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Grace and said, "If Sis thinks that's not enough, then you can order some more later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His indulgent tone made her heart leap again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was fooling around just now. I better change the order and get rid of some dishes." Grace hesitated and got up to find the waiter who helped them place the order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason stopped Grace's hand abruptly and said, "There's no need for that. Why get rid of the dishes you like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want to waste food," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason seemed a little surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe the money for this meal doesn't mean anything to you, but I... don't want to waste these dishes by not eating them after ordering." Grace bit her lip slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, she had always ordered a lot of her favorite foods in one meal, but only tasted a little of everything. Then, she would talk about staying in shape, saying things like how she could not eat too much and that she had to lose weight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when her life got turned upside down, she found that it was not easy to get a full meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While in prison, she finished every meal for eating was the basis of living.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, even when there was food maliciously left on the floor, she had to pick the scraps off and eat as much as she could. If she was unlucky and the meal was rendered inedible by &lsquo;pranks&rsquo;, she would have to go hungry and wait for the next meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On another occasion, she had gotten maliciously teased for two days. She did not eat for two days and could only drink water. At that time, she realized the real fear of hunger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After being released from prison, she never wasted a meal and always finished what she should.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People were always like this. They would only cherish food after suffering the pain of hunger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared steadily at Grace. After a moment, he said, "All right, then we'll do as you say."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason called the waiter and canceled the ones the kitchen had not started on, leaving only three dishes and one soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the dishes arrived, Jason offered to help Grace set the tableware.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace picked up her chopsticks and looked at the food on the table. She never thought that a day like this would come when she would bring him here again for dinner. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her stomach gave an untimely growl. It was only then did Grace notice that she was actually a little hungry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her head down, she began to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, on the other hand, only stared at Grace.</p></div>
