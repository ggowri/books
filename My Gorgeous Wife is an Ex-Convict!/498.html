        <h1>Chapter 497</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for her, she had no way of refuting it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, Lina brought Hadwin to her house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the Sweeney household, Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney welcomed Hadwin warmly and asked him to join them for dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin agreed readily. Lina, on the other hand, was secretly fearful upon hearing that. She worried that the longer Hadwin stayed, the higher the chance for him to have a slip of the tongue when he chatted with her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After dinner, Lina quickly pulled Hadwin into her room and asked, &ldquo;When are you going back?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hoping that I leave as soon as possible?&rdquo; he asked with his brows raised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She laughed dryly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that my parents&rsquo; overzealous enthusiasm will irk you. They think you&rsquo;re my real boyfriend, so they&rsquo;ll catch all opportunities to dig more information about you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not annoying at all. Sometimes, I find it interesting to have a chat with them,&rdquo; Hadwin said. When he conversed with her parents, he could find out many things about Lina as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had found out about her childhood and other memorable experiences. He could hear more about her through the conversations with her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;One more thing... Regardless of what happens in the future, you must always remember to give me a call. You&rsquo;re not allowed to look for Grace anymore,&rdquo; Hadwin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Grace is my friend. It&rsquo;s normal for me to find her when I get into trouble.&rdquo; She argued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chuckled, but it was more like a mocking tone. If you look for Grace again, believe me when I say that Jason will get someone to get rid of you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina shuddered. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you exaggerating it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin raised his brows. &ldquo;Exaggerating? Jason is not a generous man. The last time we went to S City together, I could tell how important Grace is to him. The closer you are to Grace, I&rsquo;m guessing that his jealousy will rise exponentially as well.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina thought about the feelings she felt inside the car earlier. At that time, she did feel that Jason seemed jealous of her. Could it be real... &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a girl!&rdquo; She complained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Does it matter if you&rsquo;re a girl? Those adult comics that you used to read were about two men. So tell me why women can&rsquo;t do the same thing?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;...&rdquo; Lina felt that his statement was like a slap to her face. However, she understood that her relationship with Grace was pure friendship. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t... I can swear in front of Jason that my feelings for Grace are platonic.&rdquo; Lina sheepishly suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words made Hadwin react with a huge eye roll.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;As long as the first person you think of is me and not Grace when you&rsquo;re in trouble, then Jason won&rsquo;t have any other ideas.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, was he not jealous of her relationship with Grace as well? Although he knew they were just friends, he still felt uncomfortable about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like years ago when she immediately returned because of Grace&rsquo;s case, leaving him only a short farewell note.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could only nod her head obediently. In this generation, even women found it difficult to maintain a friendship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin then said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the lawyers to meet with you later to follow up with your case.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Thanks a lot!&rdquo; She immediately thanked him. After all, with the aid of a lawyer, she did not have to go through much trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Also&hellip; Don&rsquo;t your colleagues know that you have a boyfriend?&rdquo;</p></div>
