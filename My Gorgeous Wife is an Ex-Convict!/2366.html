        <h1>Chapter 2364</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart shuddered slightly. 'Martin Weiss's... coming here tonight?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That meant she would have to stay in this apartment today. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla briefly cleaned up. She checked the refrigerator, only to see that it was already stocked with various fresh ingredients.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the time, it was almost evening. Therefore, Kyla took out some ingredients and began to make dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was five months pregnant, but it did not stop her from cooking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She made three simple dishes and one soup. She wanted to call and ask when Martin Weiss would be back, only to remember that he seemed to have blocked her number!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was in L City, she wanted to contact him but failed. She only managed to get in touch with Martin Weiss after contacting Mallory Malcom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla waited until 7:00 p.m. before eating her portion. However, just in case, she kept the rest of the meal on the table and waited for Martin Weiss's return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The large living room was far more spacious than her house behind the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla sat on the couch, holding a throw pillow as she flipped through a romance novel she brought from home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was young, she liked reading romance novels and yearned for the same romance in books.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, the cruel reality made her stop believing in love, so she stopped reading such novels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she came across this romance novel in a bookstore when she was in L City. She bought it and put it in her suitcase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe because she no longer had romance in her life, she could not help wanting to read about it in books.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss came back, he saw the soft lights in the room. She was lying on the couch, seemingly taking a nap. There was an open book in her hand. It was obvious that she had fallen asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stepped forward and saw her gentle, peaceful face in the lamplight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed... a little gaunter than he remembered. The pregnancy was a heavy burden on her body at her age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss glanced at the book in her hand. When he saw the title, he raised his eyebrows in slight surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He remembered she used to read such books long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought she would have lost interest in such books by now, but she still read them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss took the book Kyla held in her hand, flipped through it, put it aside, and leaned over. Right as he was about to carry her back to the bed in the bedroom, she slowly opened her eyes as though she sensed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their eyes met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their faces were so close that they could feel each other's breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla thought she was in a dream for a moment. She was still in a trance when she slowly raised her hand to caress Martin Weiss's face. She felt the warmth in her palm and heard Martin Weiss's voice. "Don't you know it's misleading to do that to a man?"</p></div>
