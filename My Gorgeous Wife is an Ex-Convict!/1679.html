        <h1>Chapter 1677</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace walked forward, and her bodyguard dutifully followed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had not even reached the hospital&rsquo;s entrance when a voice from behind shouted, "Grace, Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Frowning slightly, Grace turned to look behind her and saw Sean running over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before Sean could reach Grace, he was stopped by her bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, I... I have something to say to you!" said Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, go ahead," said Grace. She gave her bodyguard a look, and he lowered his hand that was blocking Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did you just pay for my mother's medical bills and transferred us 100,000 dollars?" asked Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes." Grace admitted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why... Why did you do that? Shouldn't you hate the Stevens family and me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace replied indifferently, "I did hate you, but it has now faded and I feel nothing. I only paid for your mother's medical bills to return the favor. We don't owe each other anything from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean instantly felt a surge of emotion that he could not explain. There was embarrassment, agony, and regret... It was as though the difference between them was getting more and more distinct.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When a person stood tall enough, things they once valued were no longer valued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was just like how she was standing tall right now while he had become increasingly humble and insignificant. He was so down and out that he did not deserve her hatred for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I didn't save you... to get something in return," Sean said with melancholy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know," said Grace. She had seen the surveillance footage after the incident. He probably saved her without even seeing who she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"After finding out that Lily framed you back then and put you in prison, I thought of... seeing you, but afterward..." Sean paused and gazed at Grace. "Grace, can you... forgive me? I... did you wrong back then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He should have said this to her five years ago. It was five years too late now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was the woman he once loved. He loved her sincerely without thinking about family background or benefits. He pursued her simply because he liked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the accident afterward made him understand the power and allure of benefits. He could easily abandon the person he once loved and fall in love with another woman for wealth and benefits!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking back now, he found it ridiculous that his love had been so fragile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If that's all you have to say, then it's unnecessary. Sean, I don't hate you because it's unnecessary. But I won't forgive someone who once hurt me either. I paid for your mother's medical bills today, and I think it's best we don't see each other anymore," Grace said indifferently, her voice sounding so calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Sean felt as though her voice was pressing down on his chest like a heavy mountain, so much so that he was almost out of breath.</p></div>
