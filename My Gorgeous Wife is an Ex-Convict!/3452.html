        <h1>Chapter 3450</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Mason hasn't been staying at home these days, which makes Veronica feel uneasy. They used to go to school and come home together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But these days, she's been alone, and it's making her uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although at school, Mason seems to be the same as usual, sitting quietly in his seat, and going to the school cafeteria with her for lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only difference is that these days, there's another person eating with them, Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica remembers the first day when Daniel smiled and said to Mason, "Mason, I'm dating Veronica now, so I'm your sister's boyfriend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Daniel said this, Veronica felt stiff all over, afraid that Mason would be upset, especially since she hadn't even told him yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Previously, Mason was quite opposed to her liking Daniel. She had intended to tell him at an appropriate time, but unfortunately he went to live with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The result is that she still hasn't spoken up now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to her surprise, Mason didn't react in an exaggerated or disgusted way. He simply said, "Oh, I see. So Mr. Cross is Veronica's boyfriend now, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason... doesn't reject Daniel anymore?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica secretly looked at Mason, but couldn't tell anything from his expressionless face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After lunch ended, Veronica and Mason returned to the classroom. She couldn't help but ask, "Mason, are you willing to accept Daniel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason raised his beautiful eyes and asked, "Why should I accept Mr. Cross?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But just now you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is Veronica's boyfriend, and although I don't like him, it doesn't mean I have to oppose him," said Mason. "Since he is the person Veronica likes, I will try to get along with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Veronica finally breathed a sigh of relief and a smile of relief appeared on her face. "That's great! Mason, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her smile suddenly became unbearable to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He used to love seeing her smile, but now it's because of someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, if one day I stand against Daniel, who would you help?" Mason asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica froze, the question was like asking who to save first if two important people fell into the water at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's not appropriate to help either of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That day will never come!" Veronica thought for a moment and replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if it does?" he insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it really does, then I will try to resolve the conflict between you and not let that happen," Veronica said. "I believe that where there's a will, there's a way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason suddenly smiled and said, "Yes, I also believe that where there's a will, there's a way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He believed that one day she would realize that the person she should be with in this life is not Daniel, but him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, Mason, when are you coming back to live here?" Veronica asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason said, "I want to stay with the Reed family for a few more days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Veronica murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't it what Veronica would most like to see? My family and I strengthening our relationship a bit more?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt a sudden suffocation. Yes, wasn't she hoping that he could spend more time with his family? But now that it had actually happened, she felt a sense of disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What's wrong with her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica forcefully shook her head and forced a smile, "Well, you can spend more time with your family, that's a good thing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She should be happy and offer her blessings, that's the right thing to do!</p></div>
