        <h1>Chapter 1527</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After waiting a moment, he did not push her away even though his hands were still on her shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does that mean... he doesn't hate it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's heart instantly relaxed. She looked at the man in front of her. She had not seen him in five years. He did not seem to have changed much from what she remembered. The years seemed to have left no trace on him, and if they had, he had only grown more mature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Of course, that maturity was limited to before he cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He felt... more childlike after he cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Especially now that his peach blossom eyes were still watery. It was because of the tears. Although he was glaring at her, she somehow felt that his glare seemed somewhat alluring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It seemed extremely contradicting but also strangely attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does this man know how tempting he looks?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Almost uncontrollably, Grace leaned into him. "Jay, I missed you so much... I really missed you... I thought of you every day, wanting to see you soon and... tell you how much I love you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stiffened as her pretty face magnified in front of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She... missed me? She loves me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His body quivered slightly as if in response to the words, and her lips rested on his lips after she finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was... a kiss after five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It did not have the awkwardness Grace expected but a sense of familiarity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jay's lips... are soft. They&rsquo;re cool, yet so familiar.' His warmth and scent seemed to be bewitching her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jay was no longer the Jay she remembered five years ago. He was no longer the man she could only try to see in her dreams; he was standing right in front of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace closed her eyes gently, deepening the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason passively accepted the kiss, never thinking he would see his dead wife again one day, much less that she would kiss him like this after seeing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had always liked to be in control, but now, he only felt like she was in control of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her tongue pried open his lips and squeezed into his mouth. He let her enter. He could have pushed her away and ended the kiss, but he could not bear to do so...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could not bear pushing her away and letting the kiss end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What the hell is going on with me... Even if I loved her and married her back then, it doesn't mean that she can control me like this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the kiss was over, Grace gasped slightly and looked at Jason with a slightly red face. "Well... is that enough proof? And if that's not enough for you, I... Uh... I can continue to prove it." Um, she seemed to want more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips tightly together, not knowing how to answer all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Two hours had passed when Grace followed Jason back to Reed Residence.</p></div>
