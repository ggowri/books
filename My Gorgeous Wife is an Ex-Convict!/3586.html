        <h1>Chapter 3584</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper frowned, not understanding what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Roger asked, "Can you play 'On My Way'?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was taken aback. This was the theme song from the animated series "Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf". She had watched the show when she was a child, and had even played this particular tune on the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially now that she was at the welfare home, she had prepared many songs suitable for children before coming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's play together, four hands on the piano. Is that okay with you?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Jasper was stunned. Before she could react, Roger had already taken her wrist and led her to the piano, where they both sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Playing a four-hand piano piece is not a difficult task for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she has never practiced with Roger before and is unsure if they can coordinate well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Roger explained each person's part, he said, "Let's begin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As his voice fell, his fingers had already pressed down on the keys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Beautiful and lively music flowed out from his fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper pursed her lips and began playing on the piano keys, in coordination with Roger's playing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it was their first time playing a four-hand piece together, they had an unusual sense of harmony, as if they had played together many times before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The children listened with great interest, and some even sang along with the music, happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the performance, Roger complimented Jasper, "You played well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not at all, you coordinated well too," she replied. "Do you...um, often play four-hand pieces with others?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, you're the first," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes were filled with surprise. So, he had never played a four-hand piece with anyone else before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But their performance just now was so...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But after playing with you, I feel like we have a good understanding in our piano accompaniment, don't you think?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They did have a good understanding, considering it was their first time playing together like this, and the end result was quite impressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Meave, who was listening on the side, pulled Jasper over and whispered, "Have you been in contact with Roger privately? Your four-hand playing is too in sync."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, today is the first time," Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meave was amazed, and Roger went on to play several more pieces for the children. When there was a break in the middle, Jasper handed out small gifts he had brought for the children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One little girl who received a gift didn't leave right away, but kept staring at Jasper and asked, "Do you like Roger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper almost choked on his own saliva and asked, "What do you mean by 'like'?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you want to marry Roger?" the little girl explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was sweating profusely. Are children nowadays so mature at such a young age? She's only a few years old and already asking these kinds of questions!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course not," Jasper quickly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little girl looked at her skeptically, clearly not believing her words.</p></div>
