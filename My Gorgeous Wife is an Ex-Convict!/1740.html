        <h1>Chapter 1738</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she lost her memory, she had looked up a lot of information on recovering one&rsquo;s memory, so she naturally learned about Dr. Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he was always abroad and it was difficult to make an appointment with him. Since she had a daughter to raise at that time, she could not fly abroad to seek specialized treatment with the doctor. Hence, she did not give it a second thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, the doctor's photo was in the files on Jay's desk. 'Could it be...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace shuddered and reached out to take over the stack of information with the photo. She opened it to see some of Dr. Joseph's case analyses and his recent schedule.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">According to the schedule, Dr. Joseph had arrived in Emerald City the day before yesterday!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is Dr. Joseph in Emerald City'?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's eyes widened in surprise at the information in her hands. Speculation flashed through her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, someone knocked on the office door. Terrence opened the door and came in awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Terrence could speak, Grace asked, "What's going on with Dr. Joseph? Is Jay going to let Dr. Joseph restore his memory?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence froze. After seeing the information Grace was holding, he said, "Young Madam, Young master Reed is with Dr. Joseph now. Dr. Joseph will hypnotize Young master Reed to restore his memory!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace froze and immediately rushed up to Terrence. "Where are they right now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"They're at..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence had not even told her the address when Grace dragged Terrence out of the office. She spoke while walking, "Take me there right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the car, Grace asked, "Why didn't you say something earlier?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed didn't want me to tell you about it, lest you worry," said Terrence. He had already committed a cardinal sin by telling her about it and even bringing her to Young master Reed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace pressed her red lips together. Regaining those memories was too risky for Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jay's memory loss was not caused by brain stimulation but by hypnosis that Secretary Wang got someone to do. It was not easy to recover his memory, but Dr. Joseph was now using hypnosis to restore his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If Jay can't take it...' She was afraid to think about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did you try to talk him out of it? Besides, it won&rsquo;t be good to recover his memories like that!&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence smiled ruefully. 'Who am I to talk him out of it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No one can persuade Young master Reed once he makes up his mind, but..." Terrence paused and glanced at Grace. "Perhaps you're an exception, Young Madam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Perhaps only Young Madam's the only one who could talk Young master Reed out of it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Joseph was going to hypnotize Jason in one of the Reed family's private mansions. Although Grace had heard about it from Jason, she had never visited this mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When they tried to enter, the mansion's security guards stopped Grace. "This is private territory. No one is allowed to enter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence hurriedly said, "This is Young master Reed's wife, Mrs. Reed. Young Madam is here to see him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The security guard knew Terrence and was surprised. However, he still looked hesitant. "But Young master Reed said no one is allowed to enter during this period."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What if I insist on going in?" asked Grace. She was worried about Jay!</p></div>
