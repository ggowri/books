        <h1>Chapter 2362</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "Yeah, in these couple of days. But it's a good thing that the place isn't far. It's only two blocks from here, so it's easy for me to come over. It's just that you have to look after Nelson these days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson's my grandson. It's my duty to look after him. But you're pregnant. Can a man like him take good care of you?" Mrs. Corbyn asked worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla comforted her mother, saying, "Even if he can't take good care of me, he'll find someone to do it. Besides, I can come over when he's not around, can't I? I'll probably come here during the day and only go back at night. It's not like I have to be with him 24/7."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're right." Mrs. Corbyn thought about it and felt some relief. If it became inconvenient for her daughter to move around, she would go to her place to take care of her during the day. She could just find someone to temporarily help out at the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Kyla told her son about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could only tell Nelson that she would be staying at his father's place for a while to rest and take good care of the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson said sensibly, "Mommy, you must rest well and give birth to my sibling safely. I'll be good and take good care of Grandma!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her sensible son with a pang of sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she and Martin Weiss had not ended up like this, Nelson would have been so privileged. He would have led a life envied by many. He would not have to be so sensible at such a young age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not even ten years old but had been through many more experiences than the average kid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll give birth to your sibling safely," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson suddenly hugged Kyla. "Mommy, will you really come back? Will... Will you still like me after giving birth to my sibling?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. "What's the matter? Of course, I'll be back. I'll still like you even after giving birth to your sibling! Did someone say something to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn buried his head in Kyla's arms and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His classmates at school knew that his mother was pregnant. Some students told him that his mother would like his sibling more, especially if they were healthier than him. When you compared a healthy child to a disabled child, adults preferred a healthy child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he looked forward to the arrival of the baby sibling his mother was carrying, he could not help worrying and wondering what if his mother stopped liking him. What would he do then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he never told anyone about his panic and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson, if someone told you I won't like you after giving birth to your sibling, don't believe them. Even after I give birth to your brother or sister, you're still irreplaceable, got it?" Kyla said gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her gentle voice seemed to soothe the little one's anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Irreplaceable?" the little one muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It means you're important... You&rsquo;re very important..." Kyla hugged her son. "Nelson, you know what? You're my courage to survive. You were the reason I survived when my life was its worst. Without you, I wouldn't have been so brave. I'm brave because of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was then that she understood what motherhood meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Mommy's courage." The little one looked up to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you're my courage, so how could I not like you?" Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to do everything she could to make things up for her son.</p></div>
