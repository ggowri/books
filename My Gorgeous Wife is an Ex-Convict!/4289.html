        <h1>Chapter 4287 The Reason for the Introduction</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she's beautiful, she has always been adored by everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And because she comes from a good family, her standards are naturally high. There are not </span><span>many men in school who can catch her eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell is one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she doesn't know much about Lornell's family background, from his clothing brands, the car he drives, and his daily spending habits, she can naturally guess that he must come from a wealthy family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone who comes from a good family has exceptional medical skills, and is praised by many professors naturally makes her heart flutter. And most importantly, Lornell's appearance is undeniably attractive, his face alone has won the hearts of many women in the medical school, even without any other additional conditions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone even created a ranking of the most heartthrob male students in the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Lornell is in first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Eva, if she likes men, she naturally likes the best one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, when the classmates teased, she didn't refute, but instead hoped to take the opportunity to establish a relationship with Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't expect Lornell to suddenly bring a fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, when Eva said this, those who usually had a good relationship with Eva began to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eva is right, this is an arranged marriage by parents!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this just a joke between the two families? Isn't it supposed to be about freedom in love now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lornell, you didn't actually take this engagement seriously, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words made Harley feel inexplicably ironic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially that girl named Eva, her gaze towards her made her feel extremely uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did take it seriously," Lornell said calmly, "this engagement was decided by our two families, both families have already approved it, is it still a joke?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned, they didn't expect Lornell to take this matter seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even if you're engaged, you're still being forced," Eva said indignantly, "how can your family violate your wishes and arrange an engagement for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said I was being forced?" Lornell said, "This engagement was my decision, it was me who decided to get engaged to Harley, that's why our families arranged the engagement!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words once again left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell decided?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Eva looked even more incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's end the introduction here," Lornell asked Harley to sit down and handed her cutlery, "eat whatever you want, if there's nothing you want, then let's order some dishes you like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need!" Harley said, "I'll just eat what's already been ordered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said that and proactively started eating the food in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell didn't say anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, Harley could hardly remember what she ate, she only remembered that Lornell helped her cut the steak and poured her a drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, her mind was filled with the fact that he introduced her to his classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He directly told his classmates that he has a fianc&eacute;e!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of joy flows through her veins like a stream, spreading throughout her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing their meal, Lornell accompanied Harley back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way back, Harley asked, "Why did you suddenly introduce me to your classmates today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my fianc&eacute;e, it's convenient to use you as a shield against their gossip," Lornell casually replied. "Otherwise, they would constantly try to match me with someone else!"</span></p></div>
