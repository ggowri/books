        <h1>Chapter 2452</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only felt the discomfort growing. Her face grew paler and paler, and her hands clutched her abdomen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss hurriedly said to Kyla, "Hold on a little longer. We're at the hospital now. I'll take you to see the doctor immediately." Although the hospital did not specialize in obstetrics and gynecology, the emergency room must have some ways to ease her pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the crowd was still blocking their way as Martin Weiss tried to take Kyla to the emergency room. They continued filming them with the cameras in their hands. One of them even held their camera close to Kyla's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss waved them away with one hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The camera in their hands fell to the ground, and the expressions of the reporters instantly changed. They hit Martin Weiss while yelling, "How dare you smash my camera? Outsiders like you better get the hell out of Deer City. Who are you to interfere with the Mitchell family's affairs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss protected Kyla as he withstood the reporters' attacks. He looked flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was in so much pain that she could no longer speak. She could only feel the man beside her protecting her. She heard the sounds of someone getting hit, but she never suffered any hits on her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, there was a fit of banging sounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only saw a camera hitting Martin Weiss's head. Red blood instantly streamed down Martin Weiss's forehead and cheek before dripping onto her face. It felt so hot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart shuddered. She knew Martin Weiss was a decent fighter. He would never have gotten into such a mess if he were not protecting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was in so much pain that she could not even utter words of apology.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, the sound of fighting stopped. Kyla felt herself being held in a strong pair of arms. Then, she heard the familiar deep voice. "Bear with me. We'll reach the emergency room soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But what about him? How is he doing?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla opened her eyes almost with difficulty. She could only vaguely see his profile. Blood was dripping down his forehead and cheek. The red color was so striking...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she was enveloped in darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla woke up, she caught sight of Grace's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla asked urgently, "How is Martin Weiss? Is he alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace paused slightly before saying, "He's alright. He suffered some injuries. Fortunately, they're only skin trauma, but the baby in your belly isn't doing well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was shocked. "How is the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The burden on your liver is increasing. There's no guarantee you'll make it to seven months. If the pain flares up again, we'll probably have to take the baby out," Grace said with a solemn expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla instantly turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace continued saying, "So, we have to escort you back to Emerald City first. We have a better medical team in Emerald City that can give you better treatment. Besides, I'm afraid it's inappropriate for you to travel around with the baby after you give birth, so now is the best time to return to Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla knew that what Grace said was right. If she stayed in Deer City, she would give birth at any time. It would take a long time to treat premature babies. She could forget about leaving for at least half a year if she gave birth here.</p></div>
