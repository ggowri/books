        <h1>Chapter 3072</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's gaze also fell on the torn piece of cloth and she said, "Oh, my drink spilled on the cloth in your hand. This one is a bit torn. Why don't I give you a new silk ribbon instead? It looks much better than this one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she didn't understand why this man was holding onto a piece of tattered cloth, she found him very attractive and his clothing suggested he was wealthy. Most importantly, she made a bet with her tablemates that she could obtain something from the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, why not just take this rag? It's just something a man carries around anyway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the woman thought to herself in this way, and then eagerly reached out to try to untie the fabric on Brian's wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand was caught by Brian before it even touched the piece of cloth in his hand. With a sudden grip on her wrist, there was a loud "snap" followed by the woman's painful cries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This is... the woman's wrist was forcibly broken!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille was startled, and the friends at the woman's table were even more dumbfounded!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one expected Brian to act so decisively and use his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Replace it with a new one? What do you think this is?" Brian's cold voice, accompanied by his extremely cold expression, directly grabbed the other person's head and slammed it hard against the nearby wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman is screaming, struggling, and her face is full of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the restaurant staff dare not move because they all know who this man is!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That's the prince of the entertainment industry. A woman who foolishly gets involved with him, who would dare to help her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's friends rushed forward to try and pull Brian away, but they were stopped by Brian's henchmen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes turned crimson as he dislocated the woman's other arm. "You deserve to die! This is something Valda left for me. How dare you defile it? Who gave you permission to do so?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The roaring sound already carries a hint of madness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For Brian, this piece of torn cloth represents Valda to some extent. Now that the cloth is dirty, it also represents Valda being dirtied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And this, is something he cannot tolerate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His Valda, he hasn't found her yet, how can he do this?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, the woman's wailing was louder, but as time went on, it gradually became quieter. Camille became anxious, afraid that Brian would really go crazy and cause harm to someone. So she stepped forward and advised, "Okay, this woman has already learned her lesson. Please let her go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let her go?" His clear eyes became less and less clear. "How could I possibly let her go! Someone like her should not be let go at all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke and once again slammed the woman's head against the wall. "If I let her go, then who will let go of Valda? Can she do it? Can she forgive Valda? Why hasn't Valda come to find me? Is she still angry with me? Angry that I didn't jump down to save her, angry that I didn't say the words she wanted to hear..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian is becoming more and more crazy, as if he is about to lose control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In front of him, it seemed as if the river that took Valda away had appeared once again. The surging waves rushed towards him, and then he could no longer find that person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda... Valda..." He kept shouting this name, his forehead and the veins on the back of his hands bulging out.</p></div>
