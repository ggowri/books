        <h1>Chapter 4019</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, in the beginning, she only said she loved him because she wanted to use him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ironically, now it seems that he doesn't even have the chance to be used by her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What would be her reaction if he asked her to have an abortion? Would she agree?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then he thought to himself that even if she didn't want to, he would make her have an abortion!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he didn't dare to gamble with her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had almost lost her, and he couldn't afford to lose her again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Nancy opened her eyes again, she saw Mick's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She blinked her eyes, as if she had been seeing him every time she opened her eyes since last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you awake? Are you hungry?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She nodded, feeling hungry now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I had someone bring some food," Mick said, walking out of the ward and giving instructions to someone outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, someone brought in a bowl of hot porridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Nancy had been in a coma for five months, she had only been able to eat liquid food during this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me feed you. Your hands and arms are injured," Mick said, holding the porridge and blowing on it gently until it cooled down a bit, then holding the spoon to Nancy's lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy opened her mouth a bit dazedly and ate the porridge that was fed to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt like everything since last night was like a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Mick had previously said that he loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, his actions seem like he really does love her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can a man like him really love her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she ate the porridge that was fed to her, Nancy looked at Mick and her mind was filled with the words he had said to her before about loving her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Why are you staring at me?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry," Nancy apologized instinctively, quickly lowering her gaze and avoiding looking at Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's hand holding the spoon stiffened. "I didn't say there was anything wrong with you looking at me. It's a good thing for me if you want to look at me. You don't need to keep apologizing to me. Even if you did use me before, I don't care anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What bothered him even more was that she had said sorry to him too many times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every time she said sorry, it made him feel like there was an invisible distance growing between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do...do you forgive me?" Nancy's voice trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter what you did to me, I forgive you. No, I should be the one asking for your forgiveness. It was me who asked my father to adopt Irene into the Reed family. It was me who caused Irene to do such an extreme thing. You suffered because of me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he hadn't asked his father to adopt Irene into the Reed family in the first place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had been even harsher on Irene after she drugged him, making her completely lose the ability to plan the kidnapping, then all of this could have been avoided!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy lowered her head and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her silence made him feel uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, would you forgive me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's body trembled slightly, and she seemed to have made a decision. "Can we just forget about the past, no matter who owes who, or who has wronged who?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick looked at the face in front of him firmly and said, "Good!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And," she hesitated for a moment, "do you really love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he answered without hesitation, "I love you. You are the first person I have ever loved in my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned, knowing that this was not a lie.</p></div>
