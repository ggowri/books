        <h1>Chapter 3254</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Loneliness?" Amber smiled and said, "For me, what scares me the most is not loneliness, but not knowing the purpose of living. Now, I have goals, children, and friends. That's enough. As the saying goes, 'How can you tell if a fish is happy?'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace smiled in relief upon hearing this, "You're right, I was overthinking things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spoke and lightly clinked her glass with Amber's, then they both drank it all in one go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, Brian looked at Martin and said, "I heard you and Kyla took wedding photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Martin replied. "Speaking of which, you said something right back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What did I say?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You said that if it's something you've experienced, even if it's painful, you don't want to forget it," Martin said. "Maybe if you had told me that earlier, Kyla and I could have avoided some detours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not too bad now. Maybe detours are for a better future," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's true," Martin said lightly. "So, when will we hear your good news?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good news?" Brian was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A child, last time we met, everyone was guessing when you and Valda will have a child," Martin said, patting Brian's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not something we can rush," Brian said, although he really wanted one, he didn't want to pressure Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It can't be rushed, but if your child is too far apart in age from our children, it will be difficult for them to play together," Martin said, patting Brian's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the group of people they were talking about, the younger ones, are still quite young.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You won't believe it, but I'm sure they were discussing children among themselves today," Martin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Brian could respond, Hadwin walked over and said, "I believe it, and my wife will probably have a lot of ideas to contribute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin knows very well how many worms are in his own wife's belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard your wife is often driven crazy by your future son-in-law," Jason casually remarked as he approached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whether he will be my future son-in-law remains to be seen. It depends on what Tina thinks when she grows up," Hadwin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Tina doesn't want to, are you planning to break the engagement?" Jason looked at Hadwin and said, "Hunter is not easy to deal with."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know, and besides, Hunter saved Lina and Tina back then. But as a father, I also hope my daughter can be happy. If she really doesn't love that boy, then I..." Hadwin didn't finish his sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But everyone understood what Hadwin meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a father, how could he bear to let his daughter lose her happiness because of a promise?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It will be a tough battle," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know, but it's still early," Hadwin smiled. After all, the child is still young and no one can predict what the future holds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few men were chatting when suddenly Lina suggested playing a game together. She felt that since everyone was gathered, it would be a waste to just chat and not do anything fun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have to leave early because I have the morning shift tomorrow and need to go to work. You guys can keep playing," said Amber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are we leaving now?" Lina said with some regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace said, "We should get together more often in the future. It's not like this is the only time we'll meet." Then, she turned to Amber and said, "I'll have my driver take you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I'll just take a taxi back," said Amber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let the driver take you back, I'll feel more at ease," said Grace. As she spoke, she picked up her phone and dialed the driver's number. After a moment, she turned to Amber and said, "The driver is outside, you'll see him as soon as you leave the club."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, thanks," said Amber before leaving.</p></div>
