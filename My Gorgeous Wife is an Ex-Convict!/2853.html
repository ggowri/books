        <h1>Chapter 2851</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper clenched her teeth in hatred. She could have fooled Brian if it were not for Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm free to like Brian, Miss Theller. You have no right to interfere," said Whitney Cooper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's your freedom to like someone. But there&rsquo;ll be a problem with your integrity if you destroy people's relationships! Miss Cooper, if you're here to steal my boyfriend, I have to say that I don&rsquo;t welcome you here. Please leave!" Valda Theller said unceremoniously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper choked. Her face with delicate makeup was almost distorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you hear her?" Brian turned to look at Whitney Cooper. "You&rsquo;re not welcome here. Besides, I already told you it's never going to happen between us! If you don't want to work abroad, you can resign. Hart Group doesn't support idle people!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper pressed her red lips tightly. She could tell Brian was angry. "I... I&rsquo;ll leave. Brian, don't be mad at me. I know it's my fault. I'm sorry I upset Miss Theller."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She solemnly said to Valda Theller, "Miss Theller, I'm so sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper left after saying that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finally released Brian's arm slowly. "Just now... I..." She bit her lip, feeling flustered and embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "It was the first time I saw you so overbearing, but you're my girlfriend. You have the right to say those things to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's eyelashes quivered slightly. She did not say those words because she was his girlfriend but because she was jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was jealous of the past Whitney Cooper mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she knew Brian probably only thought of Whitney Cooper as a substitute, her jealousy could not be controlled by reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She does look like Grace," Valda Theller murmured for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, she does," said Brian as he looked at Valda Theller's hesitant look. "If you have anything you want to ask, you might as well go ahead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you happen to be here today?" She asked after some hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I knew Whitney Cooper had come to Emerald City, so I had people keep an eye on her. Then I got word that she came here, so I came," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper looked like Grace, so he let her off the hook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... Why didn't you ask her to be your girlfriend? Why me?" she asked a second question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I should&rsquo;ve asked her?" Brian asked rhetorically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She... looks like Grace..." There was a faint tremble in her voice. She knew there were probably questions she should not be asking, but she could not help wanting answers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said slowly, "Yes, she looks like her, but I don't want a substitute. You know what? I've had a lot of substitutes... before I found Grace. I kept looking for her substitutes, but the one I really want won&rsquo;t ever belong to me."</p></div>
