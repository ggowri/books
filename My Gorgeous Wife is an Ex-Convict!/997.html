        <h1>Chapter 996</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who knows? Maybe it's true love. Look at all of Young Master Gu's previous girlfriends, yet Young Master Hart is still willing to keep a woman like Stella with him. Besides, he has never denied the rumors online and clarified that they're not a couple. If this isn't true love, what is?" said Andrea Schwartz.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, the crowd seemed to think her words made sense. They suddenly looked at Grace with sympathy rather than envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz analyzed it and said, "Moreover, Stella has already started shooting a TV series. It seems to be a good role. I also heard that Young Master Hart accompanied her to the shoot! As for Grace&hellip; She&rsquo;s only a paralegal at the firm. Young Master Hart could just start a firm for Grace if he wanted to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz looked at Grace apologetically as if realizing that she had misspoken."Grace, I'm sorry, I... I'm just making a wild guess. Maybe... Young Master Hart will start a firm for you soon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was implying that Brian was not taking Grace seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, the other colleagues around them heard and agreed. 'If the crown prince really cares about Grace, why would he let her work here as a mere paralegal?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, some colleagues were now looking at Grace as if she was a failed homewrecker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace did not pay Andrea Schwartz any attention and only buried herself in work. She ignored Andrea Schwartz completely, making Andrea Schwartz look like she was talking to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz returned to her seat, feeling resentful for having humiliated herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the gossipy colleague from earlier exclaimed, "Andrea Schwartz, you're trending online!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does that mean?' Andrea Schwartz was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the colleague kept quiet and dared not look at Andrea Schwartz anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz quickly pulled out her phone and searched the topics that were trending online. A moment later, she saw the name &lsquo;You Keer&rsquo; on one of the trending topics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instantly had a bad feeling. When she clicked on it, the scene she wanted to erase most appeared in the relevant video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the video, two women were pulling and hitting her while You Keer glared at her. "So you're the one who led me to the firm the other day to catch the homewrecker and embarrassed me! I thought someone righteous like you was innocent, but you're just a f*cking b*tch! Does your boyfriend know that you've been going on blind dates with other men?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, they could hear Andrea Schwartz's screams and struggles in the video. Even her clothes were torn to pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on? Who filmed it?' When You Keer left yesterday, she had warned her not to reveal this to the public. After all, it was illegal for You Keer to get someone to beat people in private.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, someone had posted the video online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz quickly turned off the video, but when she looked up, she found that the colleagues who had looked at Grace with sympathy earlier were now looking at her sympathetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, there was more disdain than sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, No. It's not like what it seems in the video!" Andrea Schwartz quickly tried to defend herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's it like, then? Were you not the one who asked You Keer here that day?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was wondering how You Keer got here so fast that day. If Young Master Hart hadn't come, You Keer would probably have quarreled with Grace thinking she was a homewrecker."</p></div>
