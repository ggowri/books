        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Jay," She called out to him, but this time more loudly. &ldquo;Stay with me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace held his face and stared deep into his eyes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The memories were like a wave, sweeping him up and dragging him miles out to sea. He wasn&rsquo;t trying to ignore her, but once he went down this particular path of memories, it was hard to shake all the details and feelings that came rushing in.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because it wasn&rsquo;t just his mother. It was the death of his father. The abuses of his grandfather. The absence of any family or familiarity.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was it any wonder he turned out the way he did?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His past had sharpened him into this present man. One who could lie effortlessly and move people around as if life was some chessboard.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's nothing.&rdquo; Nothing anyone could do or change.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's good." She breathed a sigh of relief. "The way you looked just now was like..." She thought for a while and came up with a description. "It was like a piece of glass that was about to break. You scared me for a moment."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Glass?" He chuckled and a dark and hostile glint flashed in his eyes, but it disappeared in an instant and his gaze returned to normal. "Sister, in this world, no one can break me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace dropped her hands from his face. She looked&hellip;unsteady. As if she was seeing him, but only really seeing him for the first time.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was she finally sensing that he was not some misshapen man in need of saving? Was she finally seeing that he had appointed himself her protector and he&rsquo;d destroy anyone that came between them?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why? He didn't even have that answer. And he asked himself the question frequently.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re okay,&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And there it was&hellip; the absolute trust.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was too smart and too perceptive to think that everything was as simple as it was presented. But she didn&rsquo;t pry. She didn&rsquo;t force him to be anything other than what he claimed to be.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Would anyone else have indulged him with his secrets? He didn&rsquo;t think so.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He stared at her and asked, "Sister, you'll never leave me, right?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled and said, "Didn't we agree before? You won't leave me, and nor will I leave you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I just forgot about it," he murmured. He stretched out his arms and held her in his embrace, appreciating her physical existence.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of all the souls on this earth, he was most content with the one beside him right now.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She said that she would not leave him, but why did he feel uneasy? Was he afraid that one day when she discovered his true identity, she would desert him?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&lsquo;Brother&rsquo; Jay could stay by her side, but what about Jason Reed? Could he as well?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the living room of the Stevens Family, Mr. Stevens asked his son, "Sean, Lily said that Jason had his secretary pick you up to meet him. Why did he suddenly want to meet you in private?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he started talking about Jason, Mr. Stevens had a hint of concern in his words. Sean recognized the tone. It was one his father seldom used, and he knew the reason for it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, the Stevens Family was dealing with the Reed Family. Their business was getting worse by the day, and their soon-to-be marriage connection with the Atkinson family would be their ticket back to success.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean&rsquo;s father was afraid that Jason was prejudiced against the Stevens Family, and that this would interfere with the marriage.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Mr. Stevens pressed again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Nothing much," Sean said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Nothing much because you say so, or because there actually isn&rsquo;t much to tell? I can&rsquo;t believe that, Sean. Why would Jason have his secretary pick you up for no reason?" Mr. Stevens asked angrily.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's right, Sean,&rdquo; his mother said as she entered the room. &ldquo;Lily isn&rsquo;t wrong to contact us&mdash;we should&rsquo;ve heard about Mr. Reed&rsquo;s visit directly from you.&rdquo; She composed herself. &ldquo;If anything did happen, you can just be honest with us," his mother said persuasively.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean took a deep breath and said, "It's really nothing."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His father crossed his arms. &ldquo;It had to be something. Quit playing games.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean could not say it. If Jason Reed were to learn that Sean had told anyone of his &lsquo;relationship&rsquo; with Grace Cummins, Sean had no doubt the retribution would be swift and harsh.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason Reed did not make idle threats.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The old patriarch of the Reed family had been rumored to be a severe man, but Sean felt the true menace was Jason. Jason showed no fear of anyone or anything. And he was so powerful, his reach of influence seemed boundless.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Does Jason still have a grudge against the Stevens Family? Does he want to take action against us?" Mr. Stevens asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It has nothing to do with the Stevens Family,&rdquo; Sean lied. &ldquo;The day Mr. Reed met me, he just talked about my engagement." It was the only excuse he could come up with. &ldquo;He wished us much happiness and success.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His parents finally breathed a sigh of relief and their expressions looked better when they heard that.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the other hand, Sean's sister, Zoe, said indignantly, "In the end, it's all because of Grace. If it weren't for her, why would our family be so nervous about this marriage?"</p></div>
