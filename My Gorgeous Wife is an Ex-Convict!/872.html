        <h1>Chapter 871</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a feeling that if she did not answer him, he would keep her here forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We broke up, so of course, I don't love him anymore. Can you let go now?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then who do you love?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to love anyone. She just wanted to be alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raising her almond-shaped eyes, she looked at him and said, "Mr. Hart, it seems that whoever I love has nothing to do with you. When we were on the hill, didn't you say that we're only strangers from then on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened. 'Strangers... Just treat her as a stranger.' It was really hard when he had to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw her standing awkwardly at the pool table that night, he could not stop himself from looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her presence could easily interrupt his insistence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after he heard that she and Jason had broken up, he felt a pang of joy in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why was I happy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I glad that I have a chance now? That's ridiculous! There are so many women in Emerald City who want to climb into my bed. Many women would also pander to me and suck up to me. Why should I covetously love a woman who doesn&rsquo;t have me in her heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She&rsquo;s a beauty, but in the entertainment industry, there are many more women who are prettier than her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... How I yearn for her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how he would somehow feel satisfied if he got to look at her a minute longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When did he become so inferior?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, Grace, what... are you guys doing?" Stella hurried over with a flash of jealousy in her eyes. Feigning kindness, she said, "Brian, did Grace say something that has offended you? Don't think too much about it. Just forgive Grace for my sake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's smug performance only made a sneer flash across the corners of Grace's lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian did loosen his fingers and Grace took the opportunity to pull her hand away. Then, she took a step back. "Alright, I won't bother you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Grace hurried off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian watched as the slender figure walked further away until she disappeared from his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella looked at Brian with fear in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he looked at Grace's back was like... he was reluctant to part with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, the way you held Grace's hand earlier could easily cause misunderstandings. If Mr. Jason misunderstood, it'll affect Grace's relationship with him," said Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They broke up," Brian said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was stunned. 'Broke up? Grace and Jason have broken up?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In theory, Grace's loss would make her happy, but when she thought about the way Brian looked at her just now, Stella felt a strong sense of crisis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, go on with your filming. I... I've got something to do. I gotta go," Brian said without a spark of interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Stella tried to persuade him to stay, but Brian had already turned around and walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella gritted her teeth with resentment. Today was her first acting role. Although she was only playing a small supporting role, it was an easy character for her to shine and impress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had asked Brian to accompany her today, saying that it was her first shoot and she was intimidated. Besides wanting to spend more time with him, she wanted to leave an impression on the set.</p></div>
