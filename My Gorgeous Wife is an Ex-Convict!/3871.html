        <h1>Chapter 3869</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a long while, Jasper took a deep breath and surveyed the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had never told Lawrence that this studio was originally prepared for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her imagination, when she found him, he might still have a passion for music and become a musician who would need such a studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the final result proved that she was just being sentimental.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reality and imagination were ultimately different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jasper walked out of the building, a figure caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't the driver, but William!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper hurried over and asked, "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"To pick you up," William smiled slightly and asked, "Is it over?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...I think it's over," she hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You think?" he raised an eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know why, but I always feel that maybe in the future, he will come back to Emerald City," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if Lawrence's departure this time was only temporary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if he returns to Emerald City, I won't let him harm you," William held Jasper's hand and said, "Jasper, I will make myself strong enough at that time to help you eliminate all dangers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I believe you," Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her William was always so gentle and considerate. When she was uneasy, he would give her enough sense of security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Lawrence sat in the first-class cabin of the plane at the airport, waiting for takeoff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He came to Emerald City with the intention of revenge, but what he wanted more was to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when he really saw her, he realized that the gap between them was deeper than he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He loved and hated her, not knowing what to do with this feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for her feelings towards him, it was only the childhood affection and guilt and regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, even these feelings were gone. She wanted to completely let him go from her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Lawrence smiled bitterly. It was his own choice to go after Mason and Veronica, and now he would naturally face her hatred, which he had already expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps the Reed family let him leave Emerald City this time because of their guilt towards him, so they didn't take any action against him in secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, although there was no evidence to convict him legally, if the Reed family wanted to get rid of him in secret, it wouldn't be difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, it's not over between us," Lawrence murmured, raising his hand and kissing his own palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if he was kissing the lips that were pressed against his palm yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the online buzz about Veronica and the Reed family died down, Veronica finally returned to her normal life and studies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Mason continued his studies at Stanford University.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Mason had recovered, Veronica moved back to her old apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the Reed family tried to persuade her to stay, especially Jasper who was reluctant to see her go, Veronica felt that it was not appropriate to live with them for a long time since she and Mason were still in the dating stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason was happy to help Veronica move her luggage back to her apartment, and he even brought his own luggage along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not planning to live here too, are you?" Veronica widened her eyes as she looked at the two suitcases Mason brought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," he replied simply.</p></div>
