        <h1>Chapter 1422</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Harold Atkinson said, "Jason, after all, the Atkinson family and the Reed family were friends once. You're not really going to wipe us out, are you? The Atkinson Garden project is very important to the Atkinson family. The Reed family might not be able to profit much from it after taking it. Why make things hard for everyone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The Atkinson family has had their glory long enough, and now it's time to draw the curtains," Jason said lightly. His calm attitude at the moment was a far cry from Harold Atkinson's tense appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hasn't the Atkinson family worked well with the Reed family all these years? If you have any opinions or conditions, you can tell me. You can just tell me what you want. If the Atkinson family can do it&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I want all the companies under the Atkinson family to be removed from Emerald City," said Jason as he interrupted Harold Atkinson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Harold Atkinson's expression immediately changed. Jason&rsquo;s request was basically asking the Atkinson family to throw away all their properties in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Most of the Atkinson family's properties were in Emerald City. They had some properties in other places too, but if they lost their foundation in Emerald City, then the Atkinson family was done for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Harold Atkinson glared at him. "Why? Is it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A possibility flashed across Harold Atkinson's mind, but then he thought that it was too crazy. 'Is it possible? Would Jason spend so much effort to take on and wipe out the Atkinson family just for a woman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he could not think of any other reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Atkinson family had gotten into trouble with Jason only over Grace's imprisonment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you doing this for Grace?" Even though Harold Atkinson asked the question out loud, it still felt unreal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What if I am?" Jason readily admitted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'So... it's really about Grace!' Harold Atkinson gasped. "But... Lily has already paid the price for Grace&rsquo;s case!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It could be said that Lily had been forced by Jason to quit the entertainment industry in a disgraceful way because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Atkinson family thought that was the price to pay, but now it seemed to be much more than that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lily merely quit the entertainment industry. It's ridiculous to think that you&rsquo;ve paid the price with just that," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Harold Atkinson suddenly got up and said with a grim face, "In that case, are you really going to wipe out the Atkinson family, Master Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"My wife can't have suffered for nothing, can she?" Jason asked with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, Grace had left the detention center and arrived at Reed Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young Madam, Master Reed is meeting Chairman Atkinson in his office right now," the secretary reminded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Chairman Atkinson?" Grace was stunned. "The chairman of Atkinson Group?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," answered the secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, got it. You can go back to work," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not have a good impression of the Atkinson family. After all, Lily had pulled out her fingernails and almost ruined her hands. Afterward, the Atkinson family sent many people to give her a &lsquo;treat&rsquo; when she was in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she wondered why Lily's father, Harold Atkinson, was here to look for Jay. 'Is it because of Atkinson Garden?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace thought of Atkinson Garden's proposal which she had seen on Jason's desk and the photos of Jennifer the Atkinson family had sent.</p></div>
