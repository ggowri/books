        <h1>Chapter 2644</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright!" Lina's voice interrupted her thoughts. "You're just overthinking. Stop thinking about Brian and his girlfriend. What you should do now is take good care of your baby and ensure safe delivery.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. 'Yes, what I should do now is take good care of my baby. I shouldn&rsquo;t be entertaining foolish ideas.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day of the booting ceremony, Valda Theller arrived at the film studio with heavy dark eye circles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Camille Strickland saw the way her best friend looked, she said, "What happened to you? Didn't you sleep well last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You noticed," said Valda Theller. She had already used foundation to hide her dark eye circles, but it did not seem to have much effect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I noticed." Camille Strickland rolled her eyes at her best friend. "I know this is your first adaptation and you&rsquo;ll be meeting Gloria today, but you didn&rsquo;t have to be so excited about it that you even lost sleep over it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled. She was too embarrassed to tell her best friend that this was not the reason she did not sleep well. It was because Brian's cold and depressing gaze came to her mind whenever she closed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, the pregnant lady with a gentle smile, was his taboo. The coldness and depression in his eyes were all because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An answer vaguely came to mind. Maybe he wanted her to pretend to date him because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he introduced her as his girlfriend to Grace, he had squeezed her hand so tightly that his fingers stiffened afterward. A person's body could only react like that when they were tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want a cup of coffee to refresh yourself?" Camille Strickland asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks, I had coffee at home this morning before coming over," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let's say hello to the producer and the director. We should be able to meet Gloria too," said Camille Strickland as she led Valda Theller inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were already a lot of reporters at the booting ceremony venue. After all, Gloria had always done big-budget films. Everyone was curious why he had picked a comic adaptation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many reporters even speculated why Gloria picked this film by looking at it from multiple aspects such as director, heroine, producer...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was already sweating when she walked past the reporters and fans into the booting ceremony with her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The producer's over there, Valda. Let's head over." Camille Strickland saw the producer at a glance and dragged Valda Theller over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The producer was chatting with several other people. Camille Strickland suddenly stopped walking as if she saw something that surprised her. She said, "Huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at her best friend in confusion. "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." Camille Strickland looked troubled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller followed her best friend's gaze to see a figure she did not expect to see there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was chatting with the producer not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What&rsquo;s Raymond Bowman doing here? "Camille Strickland asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was also what Valda Theller wanted to ask.</p></div>
