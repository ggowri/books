        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In the Atkinson family's opinion, I was the one who caused Jennifer&rsquo;s death," Grace said after a long time. She&rsquo;d expected them to resent her. It was a tragedy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was just that before Lily had given the order to pull out her nails in prison, she had never known that people could be so vicious!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In my opinion, compared to her sister's death, she would probably have been happier if you had been the one to pass away." Lina's furious expression had yet to fade. "When you were sentenced back then, it wasn't even a month before Lily and Sean got together. With that speed, I don't believe that Lily didn't have any feelings for Sean in the past."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This shows that the relationship between Sean and me in the past was insignificant. I know that now. And so does the whole world. When I needed him most, he abandoned me and sided with the people trying to persecute me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It was an accident!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Grace allowed. &ldquo;But you were there in the courtroom. The evidence. The way they painted me. It didn&rsquo;t matter that what they said wasn&rsquo;t true. In reality, Lily did me a favor.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Lina was incredulous.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;By showing me who my true friends really are.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina&rsquo;s eyes were misted with tears.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace clasped her hand and squeezed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a good friend to me. I hope you know how much I love and appreciate you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Stop! You&rsquo;re going to make me cry! It&rsquo;s what any person would&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Any person, like say, my parents and half-sister? Or my other friends and work colleagues? Or, I know, what about Sean? The man who&rsquo;d vowed to love me forever.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina whistled. &ldquo;Wow. Okay, when you put it like that&hellip;I am a superior human being.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">They both laughed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Soo,&rdquo; Lina allowed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve established the shitty people in your life. Let&rsquo;s talk about the good ones.&rdquo; She steepled her hands and rested her chin on them. &ldquo;How are you getting along with that new younger brother? Do you really intend to live with him like this forever?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mm," Grace said, nodding. "If Jay is willing to stay with me, I would be very content with the arrangement."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If it were someone who didn't know, they would think that you two were dating and living together." Lina asked worriedly, "What about him? He doesn't have any improper intentions toward you, does he?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No," she said. However, for some reason, when she thought of his dark eyes and strong body, her heart seemed to beat faster once more.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey, you..." Lina looked at the red flush on her good friend's face and said in surprise, "Don't tell me that you're interested in him!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No," Grace denied. "Lina, you know, I've experienced so many things. Even when I was in prison, I... I don't intend to be interested in anyone. Those things aren&rsquo;t in the cards for me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the matter of prison was brought up, Lina's face darkened. &ldquo;Hey, maybe we can consult a doctor again, maybe&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, since I don't intend to get married, there's no point in consulting one," she said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">While she was in prison, she had been beaten up so brutally, that she suffered internal hemorrhaging. Her uterus was damaged. Although she had recovered after surgery, if she were to get pregnant in the future, she would be facing much higher risks than an ordinary person would. If she could conceive at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even the doctor had once advised her not to get pregnant in the future. The complications could prove fatal for both her and her baby.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Grace had no intention of bringing a baby into this world. What kind of life could she provide for her child? A simple existence in a shitty little apartment? And what of the stigma her baby would bear as the child of &lsquo;an ex-convict&rsquo;? She knew how cruel people could be and she would never do that to an innocent baby.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina's heart ached for her good friend, but she did not know how to comfort her. She could only change the topic and say, "By the way, that younger brother of yours&mdash;after all, he was a stranger before. And I&rsquo;m not saying this to take away from your happiness&mdash;you deserve only the best things!&mdash;but when you talk about Sean and your dad and our friends&hellip; they all knew you. This guy is a total stranger. Who&rsquo;s to say he won&rsquo;t someday change? Just be careful. ok?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I will," Grace said. "However, even if I don't know much about Jay, there's one thing I'm certain of. No matter what, he will not harm me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina was glad to see the smile on Grace&rsquo;s face, but inside, Lina was panicked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had walled herself off from everyone, except for this young man who was now living with her. She cared about him, deeply.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It&rsquo;s like she took all the emotion and affection she couldn&rsquo;t give to anyone else and lavished it on him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Jay were to hurt her&hellip; Lina wasn&rsquo;t sure Grace would survive it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">***</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily had been wading through the pool of the Reed family for almost a whole night before she finally found Jason's ring.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was on the verge of collapse and hypothermia when she was taken to the hospital. She even had to get an IV drip. Of course, when she got hooked up to the drip in the hospital, she did not forget to let her agent take photos and post them on the Internet to gain sympathy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After what happened, Lily held a press conference with a sickly appearance.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the press conference, she apologized in public and said that because the ring was given to her by her boyfriend Sean, she cherished it very much. On that day, she had thought that had been the ring she was wearing when she went out. When she was outside, a friend had alerted her that the ring was not on her hand, so she thought that it had fallen off. Therefore, in a moment of anxiety, the situation of her asking people to help her find the ring emerged.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm sorry. It was because of my carelessness that so many sanitation workers had to help me find the ring. I, on the other hand, stood to the side and did not look for the ring together with them. I sincerely acknowledge my mistake."</p></div>
