        <h1>Chapter 3971</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked at Mick in a daze. During the time they spent together, she had seen many of his expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...she had never seen this pain in his eyes before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And was it because of her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not what you think. I'm just gambling on how much you feel for me. Because your feelings for me are the only thing I can rely on," she defended herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, in the end, I'm the stupid one. I'm stupid enough to fall in love with a woman like you, stupid enough to not be able to tell whether you like me or are just using me," he said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was devoid of color, "Mick, I...I don't just use you, I...I like you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, he interrupted her directly, "You want to say that you like me, right? So while you're using me, you also like me. Do I need to be grateful for that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His slender fingers squeezed her chin harder. "Nancy, you make me sick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her chin felt like it was about to be crushed, but strangely, she didn't feel any pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just stared at him blankly. Sick? So he already found her disgusting. Yes, she had done something unforgivable. Did she really expect him to forgive her and continue to love her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had trampled on his feelings with her own hands, and now she was just accepting the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry." She had considered countless ways to beg for his forgiveness, but in the end, it boiled down to these three words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think a simple apology can make everything right?" He spoke harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bitterness filled her mouth. "Then, Mr. Reed, can you tell me what price I have to pay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was willing to pay any price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three words "Mr. Reed" seemed to widen the distance between them again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you afraid that I'll have someone cripple you? In Emerald City, no one dares to mess with the Reed family." Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you want me to become crippled?" She murmured in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pale face and lifeless eyes seemed to tell him that even if he did cripple her, she wouldn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger boiled in her chest, growing stronger by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Mick let go of her and said, "You better not appear in front of me again. Otherwise, next time, I won't be squeezing your chin, but your neck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Mick turned around and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence enveloped Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood still, dazed, until tears finally rolled down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought the most painful moment in her life was when her mother passed away, and she believed she would never experience such pain again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she was in agony once more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was suffocating her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She brought this upon herself. It was destined to end this way since the moment she decided </span><span>to use him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she had fallen in love with him first, how much better it would have been!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She truly fell in love with him, but the man who once loved him would never love her again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mick, I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." She crouched down, crying and choking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the love she had for him turned into despair, it became so painful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Painful to the core!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Painful to the bone!</span></p></div>
