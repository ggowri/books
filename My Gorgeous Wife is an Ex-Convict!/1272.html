        <h1>Chapter 1271</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Grace!" said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said guiltily, "I haven't helped much. It's mainly because of the video that was exposed. Besides, you were set up because of me. This would never have happened if you didn't know me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But what's with the video? Looking at the video, the camera was probably secretly installed in the car. Who on earth installed that in Stella's car? What was their original purpose?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no clue about these yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper hurriedly said, "No, no! You&rsquo;ve been very helpful. If it hadn't been for you, I would've been worried sick in jail!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew Chase Harper did not want her to feel guilty about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without saying anything more, she helped Chase Harper with the procedures and walked out of the detention center with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, is Brian really suing your cousin for fraud?" asked Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think so, but I just read it from the gossip online. I don't know the details, and I've stopped talking to Brian," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it... because of my case?" Chase Harper asked somewhat uneasily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, don't overthink it. He and I were never that close," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper wanted to say something but ended up saying nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying goodbye to Chase Harper, Grace called Kyla Corbyn to tell her that Chase Harper was all right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Kyla Corbyn had been feeling guilty about Chase Harper's case these days, thinking that if she had not agreed to have Chase Harper pick up Nelson from the hospital, then Chase Harper might not have gotten set up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's call got through, and Kyla Corbyn was pleasantly surprised. "Really? Has he really been released?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yeah. Chase Harper won't be facing any more troubles now. There's just another thing. Lina... has been hospitalized."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Kyla Corbyn was surprised. Besides worrying about Chase Harper's case, she had been busy working these days, so she had no time to read the news and naturally never followed the news about Hadwin Stephenson's disappearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, when she learned from Grace that Hadwin Stephenson was missing and Lina was hospitalized with serious injuries and even in a coma right now, she was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Which hospital is Lina in? I... I'll go and see her," Kyla Corbyn said hurriedly. Although she and Lina had not known each other for long and had only met a few times, Kyla Corbyn liked Lina. She was a straightforward and unscheming friend. She sometimes even thought she was very much like her when she was younger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, when she saw Hadwin Stephenson and Lina together, she found such love to be great! She really hoped they could be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she never expected such a thing to happen.</p></div>
