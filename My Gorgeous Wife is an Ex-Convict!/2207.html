        <h1>Chapter 2205</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew Jacqueline Bowman from prison. Everyone wore prison clothes there and nobody ever had makeup on. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, long time no see." Jacqueline Bowman stepped forward while eyeing Kyla. "I didn't expect to see you here. Are you here because you're pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Kyla nodded. "And you? Are you pregnant too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to check my fertility. The older a woman gets, the harder it is for her to conceive. I seem to recall you being a few years older than me. You've gotten pregnant at this age. Is this your second child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good. I'm not even pregnant yet. I wish to get pregnant so that I can turn my life around." There was a look of determination in Jacqueline Bowman's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze slightly. She saw ambition on her face. It was as if she could only achieve that ambition by getting pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, the VIP consultation here is quite expensive. You must be well off since you could get the VIP consultation here," said Jacqueline Bowman. She thought a woman like Kyla would be living a miserable life after getting out of prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was an ex-convict with a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides that, she heard in prison that Kyla was sent there because she offended a big shot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess I'm doing alright," Kyla said a little reluctantly after biting her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jacqueline Bowman misunderstood Kyla's reluctance. Judging from the way Kyla looked, she thought Kyla was leading a good life because she became a wealthy man's lover after getting out of prison&mdash;just like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, what was an ex-convict with a son capable of? Kyla was also quite pretty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A woman's youth is limited. Are you married now? If you're not, the baby must be a boy if you're trying to force the father to marry you by using the baby you're carrying. A lot of guys won't care if the baby's a girl. Do you want me to introduce you to an ultrasound doctor? They can check the baby's gender. If the baby's a girl, you can abort them and see if you can conceive another one," said Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla frowned, only thinking that the woman in front of her was different from the person she knew in prison many years back. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Jacqueline Bowman in prison was a little submissive and timid. She usually spoke in a soft voice, but she would occasionally help her with her medicine or offer her a glass of water after she was bullied. Jacqueline Bowman had helped her, so Kyla liked her and was thankful for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She heard that Jacqueline Bowman was imprisoned for embezzlement. Jacqueline Bowman's mother was seriously ill and had no money for medical treatment. Therefore, Jacqueline Bowman took advantage of her finance executive position to embezzle more than one million dollars from the company for her mother's medical treatment. However, her mother eventually died, and Jacqueline Bowman was found guilty of embezzlement. She was prosecuted and sentenced to seven years in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was still in prison when Kyla was released.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jacqueline Bowman now seemed to seek nothing but profit. It was as if it was a normal thing for her to abort a baby just because of their gender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the baby was just a tool!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, perhaps people would change&mdash;just like how she was no longer the same person back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I don't need to force anyone to marry me. I want the baby whether they're a boy or a girl!" said Kyla.</p></div>
