        <h1>Chapter 2861</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've seen the video of the incident at the comic fiesta. How is Valda doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was surprised. "Video? Did you see it online?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille Strickland, tell me how Valda is doing?" Raymond Bowman shouted impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland felt as if she was going to turn deaf. "I've accompanied Valda back to her apartment. Where did you watch the video?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Raymond Bowman hung up instead of answering her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland glared at her phone, and something was caught in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly opened the web search page on her phone. She soon found a lot of videos about the incident that took place at the comic fiesta that recorded Wynne&rsquo;s accusations and all sorts of things and drinks being thrown at Valda. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people blamed Valda for bringing it upon herself in the comments below! Some people even said Valda probably fooled Brian into dating her and that they would break up soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was furious to read the comments!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They would probably need Brian to take care of this. They had no idea when Brian would find out about the video. Valda would have to contact Brian immediately when she got out of the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the bathroom, Valda Theller looked at the mess she was in in the mirror. However, compared to this, what was worse was when she saw Brian turn around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart throbbed in pain, and her body seemed to be getting colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did he turn around? Why didn&rsquo;t he come over when he clearly saw me?&rsquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly smiled bitterly and muttered, "Didn't I say that I didn&rsquo;t want to depend on others? Yet I wanted to depend on him when I got into trouble. Valda Theller, you're so funny. He only likes you, and maybe only a little bit at that. Why do you have such high expectations?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe the greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not be disappointed if she had no expectations in the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had too many expectations. She thought Brian might like her more than a little. Perhaps she had been overthinking everything. Today was only a wake-up call to make her aware of her position in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned on the shower and let the warm water wash over her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the water was hot, she felt colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It turns out that being left behind is so painful. It turns out that... when you love someone deeply, you&rsquo;ll feel your heart breaking when you see him turn away...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ahh!" Valda Theller crouched down and cried as if she could no longer contain the pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The water washed over her body, mixing with her tears...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had no idea how long she cried or how long she took to bathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she came out of the bathroom, she was surprised to see Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, Raymond Bowman came over himself. I didn't ask him to come!" Camille Strickland hastened to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman lunged forward, stared at Valda Theller, and said, "How are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine," Valda Theller said quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman said worriedly, "You got things and drinks thrown at you. How are you fine? You were crying, weren't you?" Her red eyes seemed to silently tell others she had been crying her heart out earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned around to look at Camille Strickland. Camille Strickland hurriedly replied, "I didn't tell him about the comic fiesta. He found out about it from videos posted online."</p></div>
