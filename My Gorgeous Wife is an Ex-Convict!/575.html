        <h1>Chapter 574</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on. Let's go get dinner first," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Lina heard that there was food, she perked up immediately. One of the advantages of dating Hadwin was that she could eat a lot of things that she previously could not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once out of the cinema, Hadwin drove Lina to a famous restaurant. Lina had only seen the restaurant in a gourmet magazine before and had never gotten the chance to eat there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nevertheless, after coming to date Hadwin, they dined there several times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The food in the restaurant suited her tastes rather well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon entering the restaurant, Hadwin asked for a private room. Lina sat in the private room and ignored the Howell Webb posters she had gotten that day. Instead, she browsed her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, Lina's face took a ghastly expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the matter?" asked Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina said angrily, "These people are going too far. Do they know the truth? It's true that you only need one mouth to create rumors while denying them takes great effort."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin grabbed Lina's phone from her hand and looked at it. A video was being played on the screen of Lina's phone. It was a video of Grace and Evelyn's earlier conflict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the point of view in the video, it seemed like Grace had pushed Evelyn away on purpose. Accompanied by Evelyn's pitiful performance, it made many viewers take her side; they accused Grace of being "mean" and "spiteful".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While some of Evelyn's fans added fuel to the fire in the comments, some even exposed Grace's imprisonment, accusing her of being a murderer online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people even believed that Grace was the other woman who had stepped between Brian and Evelyn's relationship. Otherwise, why did Brian care more about Grace instead of his girlfriend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Evelyn couldn't have worse luck to have such a sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does she still want to be the crown prince's girlfriend after having been to prison? She must be crazy for being that power-hungry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't cry, Evelyn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina almost threw up after seeing everyone comforting Evelyn and vilifying Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had known that someone would publish the conflict on the internet, but she had not expected it to happen so soon. Not to mention, the reproaches against her best friend were so overwhelming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She did not believe that no one was adding fuel to the fire behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That b*tch Evelyn. Could she have deliberately hired spammers online in an attempt to crush Grace with the public&rsquo;s opinion?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina guessed the possibilities of it, and the more she thought about it, the more likely it seemed to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That b*tch Evelyn is purposely trying to make Grace's life miserable. What did Grace do to her? Grace couldn't have worse luck to have a little sister like her," Lina said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time the food arrived, Lina had lost her appetite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can rest assured that your friend has nothing to lose. This Evelyn won&rsquo;t be smug for long," Hadwin said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina was stunned. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your friend has Jason to protect her. What do you have to worry about? As for Evelyn..." Hadwin gave a meaningful smile. "Maybe it won't be long before she gets off the throne as his girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina immediately perked up when Hadwin said this. "Do you mean Brian will break up with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just a speculation," replied Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then, explain why you think so," Lina said with an open mind.</p></div>
