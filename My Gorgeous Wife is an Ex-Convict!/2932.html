        <h1>Chapter 2930</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hospital room, only Brian Hart and Valda Theller remained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face turned slightly red, as if she had gathered great courage, she said, "Um... if you need to use the restroom, I can close my eyes and help you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart couldn't help but laugh, but because of the laughter, it pulled on his wound, causing him to furrow his brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong, is your wound hurting?" She asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's fine," he said, "I can have my men assist me to the restroom. You just need to help me with pouring water when I can't move easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller breathed a sigh of relief, as long as it wasn't the restroom, everything else was fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were scared today," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A little," she murmured. First, Camille's disappearance, and then he was stabbed. Her heart had been beating rapidly. "You took a stab for me, and I don't know how to repay you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were someone else, she could give money or gifts, but with him, she didn't know what she could do to compensate for his injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You not being injured is the best repayment for me," he said. He was truly grateful that the knife had stabbed him instead of her. How much more pain would she have felt?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that when you cared for someone, you couldn't bear to see them in pain. If she was in pain, he would only feel more pain than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, it's getting late. There's a companion bed next to here, you should rest too," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hospital room was a VIP room, besides the patient's large bed, there was also a small single companion bed next to it. Although it was small, it was comfortable enough for ordinary people to sleep in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you need anything, just call me," Valda Theller reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know," Brian Hart replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller then lay down on the small bed and closed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart quietly watched her sleeping face not far away. At this moment, she was both near and far from him. Did she know that he was really happy when he saw the worried look in her eyes because of his injury?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least, she still had him in her heart, and she would worry about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And when the doctor was stitching up his wound, she was clearly afraid, but she still held his hand tightly, her eyes fixed on every stitch the doctor made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, do you know? I'm so happy tonight..." he murmured softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was happy that she thought of him when something happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was happy that he could be injured for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And he was even happier... that she still had him in her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The low humming voice drifted in the air, and he foolishly watched her, unable to bear to close his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that looking at her for one more second was also good.</p></div>
