        <h1>Chapter 4246 He’s not Angry but Jealous</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler glanced at her</span><span>. He </span><span>didn't say anything, and just walked out of the alley while </span><span>supporting </span><span>Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the three of them got in the car, Chandler drove to the nearby hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit, who was in pain and mentally relaxed, had already passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina said to Chandler, "Thank you</span><span> for everything</span><span> today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you thanking me?" Chandler asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for helping me and Kit in the alley," Tina said, "and for taking him to the hospital now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler pursed his lips. "You're my wife, so there's no need for you to thank me for helping you </span><span>out </span><span>in the alley. Isn't it the husband's duty to help his wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for me helping Kit and taking him to the hospital, if anyone should be grateful, it should be him</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>He should be thanking me </span><span>when he wakes up, not you," </span><span>He added</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt that Chandler's voice had a kind of coldness that she had never heard before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you angry?" she asked cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler sighed. "I'm not angry. Don't think too much. We'll be at the hospital soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then both of them stopped talking</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True enough, they arrived at the hospital quickly, and medical staff placed Kit on a moving stretcher for emergency treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina and Chandler stood outside the emergency room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at Chandler, who had almost no expression on his face and approached him, saying, "I'm really sorry for today. We didn't get to see the exhibition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay. We can see it next time," he said in a flat tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's coldness made Tina feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said he wasn't angry, but she always felt that he was. </span><span>Tina wondered how</span><span> she handle</span><span>d</span><span> situations like this in the past</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she had no memories of her past, so she naturally didn't know how to handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was explain, "I was waiting for you at the exhibition hall. Then I saw Kit leaving with that man, and heard someone say that someone was beaten in the alley. </span><span>So</span><span> I went to take a look and saw Kit being beaten by that </span><span>person's </span><span>men."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what that man said wasn't true. Kit didn't seduce that man's mother. I had heard Kit's father ask him to </span><span>be </span><span>that man's mother</span><span>&rsquo;s toy boy</span><span> before, but Kit refused. He didn't want to rely on that kind of man to make money. He said he didn't need a luxurious life, he just wanted to earn a living through his own efforts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I even suggested that the Stephenson family could help him, but he also refused. </span><span>A person like him</span><span> could</span><span>n&rsquo;t</span><span> possibly seduce that man's mother</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina kept explaining, while Chandler quietly listened</span><span> to her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that she was hoping he wouldn't misunderstand</span><span> her</span><span>, that he wouldn't get angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Chandler wasn&rsquo;t actually angry</span><span>.</span><span> In fact, he was jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was jealous </span><span>that she </span><span>would </span><span>protect Kit so recklessly, regardless of her own safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she ever consider what would have happened if he hadn't shown up in time? She might be lying in the emergency room right now, just like Kit!</span><span> </span><span>Even though she had faced so many difficulties in the past, why did she still rush into danger like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she not afraid of death?</span><span> </span><span>Or was she just too concerned about Kit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever he thought about these </span><span>questions</span><span>, </span><span>he would be consumed by jealousy.</span></p></div>
