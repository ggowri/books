        <h1>Chapter 1435</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss?" Grace was stunned. 'It's almost past 10 p.m. now. Martin Weiss is here to see me? And he's drunk?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll go see him!" Grace said immediately, quickly trying to get out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wait!" Jason grabbed her wrist and said, "Why don't I see him and you can rest?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'd better go and see him. I'm afraid he's probably here for Kyla," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason sighed and said to the butler, "Ask someone to bring Martin Weiss to the living room." With that, he turned to Grace and said, "Even if you're seeing him, at least put on your shoes and extra clothes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knelt in front of her as he spoke. He held up her feet and carefully helped her wear her shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before leaving, the butler caught a glimpse of Jason who was kneeling in front of Grace. He could not help sighing to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Only Young Madam can make Young Master do that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'People of the Reed family are either too ruthless or too dedicated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Old Master is a heartless man, but Old Master's son and grandson are both dedicated to their lovers. They dedicate all their feelings to one woman and can even... live or die for them...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He only hoped that Young Master would not follow in his father's footsteps and live a wonderful life with Young Madam. Perhaps they could bring some laughter to the Reed family's cold mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked down at Jason who was crouching down to put on her shoes and suddenly had a warm feeling in her heart. This feeling of being cherished was so precious to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could not help raising her hand to caress the black hair on top of his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hands stopped what they were doing and he looked up at her. At that moment, his beautiful peach blossom eyes met her gaze with a gleam of light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She felt as if her heart had missed a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter?" he asked in a gentle voice. It felt like a gentle breeze that passed through her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just think you're spoiling me too much. What should I do when you don't spoil me as much someday?" she said, laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There will never be such a day. I only wish I can spoil you more." He would spoil her until she could not leave him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After putting Grace's shoes on for her, Jason covered her with a coat, lest she caught a cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They went to the living room on the first floor. Martin Weiss had already been brought in and was shouting in the living room. "Grace, I... I want to see Grace! Let me see her... Grace, come out..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss staggered and stammered. He was obviously a little drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace followed Jason down the stairs and got closer to Martin Weiss, she smelled the strong smell of alcohol on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace frowned. 'Gosh! How much alcohol had Martin Weiss drunk?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss wanted to rush up to Grace as soon as he saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before he even took a few steps, Jason had already lunged forward and stopped in front of Martin Weiss, preventing the man from getting any closer to his wife!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What exactly do you want to see Grace for? You can say it out now," Jason said coldly. He was not very pleased with Martin Weiss&rsquo;s actions just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Grace was pregnant. If no one had stopped Martin Weiss, he would have run into Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes met Jason's dark gaze.</p></div>
