        <h1>Chapter 3184</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda spoke and pulled out her phone, "If there's really any trouble, I'll call you right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..." Brian still seemed worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, "I want to go to the bathroom alone. If you come with me, I'll feel like I've lost my independence. Brian, I'm not that fragile!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her determination and could only say, "Okay, then go by yourself. If you have any trouble, be sure to call me right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I got it," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until she left the private room that Brian sighed and ruffled his hair with a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she said, he couldn't be with her 24/7, but he was always afraid that something might happen to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was because he had lost her once before and knew how painful it could be, so he didn't want to experience that pain again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him now, her safety was the most important thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was now alone in the bathroom. After finishing up, she was about to leave when she suddenly saw a group of young women walk in, one of whom she recognized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She is a relative of the Hart family and she saw Lexi on the day she visited the Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, Lexi's family was kicked out by the Hart family, and the situation was quite embarrassing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, Valda considers herself to have a bad relationship with Lexi, so when she sees her, she doesn't want to make an effort to be friendly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, from the very beginning, Lexi never had good intentions towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She simply didn't want to pay attention to Lexi, but a woman next to Lexi suddenly spoke up and said, "Hey, Li, is this person your cousin's fianc&eacute;e?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi looked at Valda with an unpleasant expression on her face and said, "Yes, it's the cripple my cousin is going to marry. I don't know what kind of lowly means she used to force my cousin to marry her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi spoke contemptuously, looking at Valda with a disdainful gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever she thought about the day when Valda caused her entire family to be kicked out of the Hart family, and even her aunt and uncle forbade her from ever returning, she couldn't swallow the anger in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">You should know that she is currently a student at the Film and Television Academy. Her classmates are all future stars in the entertainment industry. Everyone is trying to get close to her now because they know she is Brian's cousin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If everyone knows that she and Brian have fallen out, then the future might not be so easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although at the moment, everyone is still unaware of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But over time, once it is discovered that she doesn't have any good film and television resources, then it will be inevitable that people will know her true relationship with the Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's just that there may be even greater embarrassment when that time comes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The few women standing next to Lexi felt a bit awkward when they heard her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, they wanted to go up and flatter Valda and get closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Lexi's words made them suddenly unsure of how to approach her.</p></div>
