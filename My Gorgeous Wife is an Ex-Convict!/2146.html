        <h1>Chapter 2144</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">" Tina will be the one to blame you, scold you, and beat you. You sold her off to save your wife!" Lina pretended to smile casually and said, "Alright, Hadwin. I'm not blaming you or am I mad at you. I won't leave you! I know you did all that for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked blankly at her. He had been terrified of her reaction ever since he made the deal with the little boy from the Hunter family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was so...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But... Tina might not be happy about it. I wonder if she&rsquo;ll think you sold her off? But in case she blames you, scolds you, or beats you, I'll face it with you! You won't be the only one she'll blame!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson only found his nose feeling sore. This woman had a way of inadvertently making him feel touched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, that's settled, then," he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She smiled, held his face, and kissed his lips. "Hadwin, no matter what we'll face, we'll face it together. We'll be together through thick and thin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson gently wrapped his hands around her waist as he accepted her kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she had not just woken up and he was afraid that she would not be able to withstand a more intense kiss, he might have kissed her back aggressively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He loved her so much that if the boy from the Hunter family had asked for Tina's life, he would have probably said yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because Lina was the only one who was irreplaceable to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They finally got the results from Municipal Women's Hospital. Dr. He said to Kyla, "We contacted specialists of liver disease from other hospitals to oversee your diagnosis. With your current condition, it&rsquo;s likely you won&rsquo;t suffer any big issues during the first few trimesters. The major issue comes after you're seven months into the pregnancy. In its current state, your liver won't be able to handle the demands of pregnancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's heart sank when she heard that. Though she had mentally prepared herself that the results might be bad, her heart still sank when she heard the doctor say so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"When I'm seven months pregnant? What if I... make it to 35 weeks? The baby's body should be fully developed around 35 weeks. I can give birth safely, can't I? Aren&rsquo;t a lot of twins delivered through C-sections around 35 weeks?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"35 weeks? That's more than eight months into the pregnancy. The stakes are still high for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If it&rsquo;ll only put more strain on my liver when I'm seven months into the pregnancy, I just have to endure for a little more than a month. There should also be some medications that I can take in the third trimester, right?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Dr. He said, "There are such medications, but your liver might get damaged when you give birth. Besides, not all medications work. For example, you have occasional pain in your liver and you can take painkillers for it if you're not pregnant. Now that you&rsquo;re pregnant, though, the only way to stop the pain is with medications available to pregnant women. But these painkillers don't help at all when your pain gets worse in the third trimester. You'll suffer when it hurts and you might lose the baby in your belly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I got it. But I want to try my best anyway. I'll accept it if I really can't keep the baby, but I'm afraid I'll regret making this decision if I don't try," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Dr. He said no more when she heard this. "No matter what happens, both of you should talk it through. If you don't want to terminate the pregnancy, the hospital will also try our best to help you keep the baby."</p></div>
