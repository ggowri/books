        <h1>Chapter 2510</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression changed as he leaned forward suddenly. His hands were pressed on her wrists, pressing her against the back of the chair. "Nonsense? Do you think everything I said was nonsense?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't it? George Gregory, all you see is money. You don't know anything about relationships!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't know anything about relationships? Why do I have to live so ascetically if I don't know anything about relationships?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I don't know anything, why was I filled with regret when I learned that she was normal?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I don't know anything, how could I have broken Louise Mitchell's finger in anger after learning the truth about her severed finger?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who knows? Are you going to say that Herman Moss knows more about relationships?" He snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Herman does. He knows what relationships are like. He was never greedy for money. He treated others sincerely!" she shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sneered. "That sounds nice. Would you have married Herman Moss if he were still alive?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him earnestly. "If Herman were still alive and wanted me, I would marry him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her statement sounded so harsh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A pang of jealousy flashed through his heart, and his voice grew colder. "It's a pity he's dead!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to marry him even if he's dead," murmured Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she said only triggered George Gregory. "You're so infatuated with Herman Moss that you want to marry him even if he's dead. Then why weren&rsquo;t you with Herman Moss when he was still alive and sneaked around?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was silent, not bothering to explain anything to the man in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to repeatedly explain herself, but he would always rather believe the rumors than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was the point of explaining it now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she used to explain herself because she did not want him to misunderstand. After all, she loved him. She did not love him anymore, so there was no need to explain it to him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her silence only reinforced his belief that he was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her and suddenly kissed her forcefully on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly froze. Then, she began violently resisting. However, her strength did not make the slightest difference. His kiss was fierce and suffocating, almost taking her breath away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kissed her only to vent his jealousy at first. She loved him back then! However, she now said she wanted to marry Herman Moss even if he was dead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as the kiss deepened, he fell into a trance as if he were back in the old days when he loved her and she loved him. Even the air was sweet back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lip suddenly hurt, and it was followed by the taste of blood in his mouth. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had bitten his lip!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not stop kissing. He kissed her harder instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smell of blood overtook the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss finally ended, Amber Mitchell raised her hand and slapped George Gregory's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, he grabbed her hand. "Do you think I'll let you slap me the second time?"</p></div>
