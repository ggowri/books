        <h1>Chapter 697</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she got to the point of hypnosis, she was a little hesitant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If that&rsquo;s my memory, am I really the one Brian is looking for? What should I do? Tell Brian I&rsquo;m the one he's looking for?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will it only create more trouble?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... If I don't get to the bottom of this, then&hellip;&rsquo; Her heart felt empty like it had no bottom. It was as if imagination and reality were constantly interlacing, making her feel uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was thinking about this, her phone rang suddenly. It was a call from Jason. Grace answered and heard a familiar male voice from her phone. "How was your trip to the hospital? Have you seen the doctor?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I have," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did the doctor say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... It's nothing serious. I'll keep it under observation for a while," she said somewhat guiltily. After all, she had always felt that partners should be honest with each other, yet now she was lying to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great. There's a trade fair tomorrow. Come with me. I've told the driver and he'll take you to Joy Color. Pick out the gown and jewelry you like," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call ended, Jason, who was on the other side of the line, looked coldly at Terrence. "What did Dr. Guzman say other than suggesting that she do hypnosis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He gave Miss Cummins the name and contact information of a psychiatrist." As Terrence spoke, he passed over a note that would surprise Grace if she came across it here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was because the name and contact number on the note were the same as the one she had gotten from Dr. Guzman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Keep an eye on this. If Grace does go to this psychiatrist, I want to know right away," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a private secretary, he could not understand why Young Master Reed would watch Miss Cummins so closely when she was only seeing a doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, what confused him more was... The doctor on this note was a psychiatrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Miss Cummins going to see a psychiatrist?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Terrence was wise enough to never inquire about what he should not ask, and that was why he was able to stay in this position for so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Joy Color was a well-known shop in Emerald City. However, Joy Color was only popular in high society. After all, those who could enter the shop were either rich or aristocratic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had visited Joy Color once when she was dating Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, she would not even know what Joy Color was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver drove Grace to Joy Color's entrance. The manager of the shop had apparently been informed. As soon as Grace appeared, he respectfully stepped forward and said, "Hello, Miss Cummins. I'm the shop's manager. My last name is Wang. You can call me Manager Wang, Miss Cummins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Manager Wang led Grace into the gown section, then passionately and respectfully introduced some gowns that were suitable for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other staff were also extremely respectful toward Grace as they would hold the gowns to show her and brought her various shoes as well as bags to look at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The treatment was simply a VIP-level treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace remembered faintly when Sean had brought her here the previous time. The staff merely gave her a curt reception before moving on to the socialites.</p></div>
