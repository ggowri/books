        <h1>Chapter 2906</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They turned their heads and saw Barbara Schuman walking into the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller couldn't help but stiffen when she saw Barbara Schuman. After all, a large part of her college nightmare was caused by Barbara Schuman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, Barbara Schuman also saw Valda Theller and Camille Strickland, and a mocking smile appeared on her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What, you two are also here shopping? Did you find anything you like?" Barbara Schuman walked up and said, "But even if you did find something, I'm afraid you can't afford it. Valda Theller, I went to the comic convention that day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face changed when she heard this. What happened at the comic convention that day was perhaps a lifelong pain for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was angry and said, "Barbara Schuman, what are you talking about!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just reminding some people not to be delusional! Thinking that they have found some powerful backing, but in the end, it's all for nothing," Barbara Schuman said arrogantly. "Just like these clothes here, you can't afford them, and you never will!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who said we can't afford them? I'll just..." Camille Strickland was about to say that she would buy the clothes here, but Valda Theller pulled her friend back and stopped her from continuing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We can bite the bullet and buy these clothes, but there's no need to go over our budget for a momentary victory. These clothes, whether we can afford them or not, what does it matter? Does being able to afford them mean that you are more noble than others? Does not being able to afford them mean that you are lowly?" Valda Theller looked at Barbara Schuman and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what? I am the daughter of The Schuman family, born noble. As for you, orphaned and living under someone else's roof, you were born lowly!" Barbara Schuman said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Barbara Schuman turned to the saleswoman standing behind Valda Theller and Camille Strickland and said, "I want everything they just looked at in this store."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" The saleswoman was overjoyed and didn't expect such a huge sale to fall from the sky! She immediately brought over all the clothes, bags, and shoes that Valda Theller and Camille Strickland had looked at and placed them in front of Barbara Schuman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman acted like a proud princess, saying to Valda Theller, "Just like now, I can easily buy something that you have seen but cannot afford. You cannot do it, and that is the best proof!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland exploded, "Barbara Schuman, do you think you are so great just because you have some money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly turned to Barbara Schuman and said, "I have seen more than just these things, there is also this." She pointed to a set of dresses in a display case not far away and said, "I looked at this dress for a long time before, but I thought the price was too expensive, so I didn't try it on. But I guess the price is nothing to Miss Schuman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman frowned and looked at the display case. The dress was a limited edition of this brand, and there was only one in the country, so the price was naturally not cheap, marked at 6.8 million.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even with The Schuman family behind her, Barbara Schuman could not just buy this dress casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That's why the saleswoman didn't bring this dress to Barbara Schuman at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Valda Theller's words made the atmosphere on the scene suddenly fall into silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What, Miss Schuman, are you not buying it? Miss Schuman is rich, she should be able to afford it," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman glared at Valda Theller, while Camille Strickland was secretly happy and said to Barbara Schuman with a smile, "Miss Schuman, if you really can't afford it, just say so. If you don't have that much money, don't pretend to be so arrogant, otherwise you will lose face and become someone who spends money but has no face."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman was so angry that she trembled all over and said, "Okay, you two, just wait and see!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After speaking, she turned around and left!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland shouted from behind, "Miss Schuman, you haven't paid for the things you asked for earlier. Is it appropriate for you to leave like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman stumbled for a moment, then continued to walk forward, as if she hadn't heard Camille Strickland's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The saleswoman, who had thought that she would make a sale, also had a black face at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and Camille Strickland ignored the saleswoman's black face and walked out of the counter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland smiled and said, "Did you see Barbara Schuman's face just now? She was really embarrassed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller shrugged and lowered her eyebrows and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland suddenly remembered something and said, "By the way, Barbara Schuman said that Brian Hart was also there at the comic convention, and he...he was there at the time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's body stiffened.</p></div>
