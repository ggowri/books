        <h1>Chapter 3327</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda gave birth to a daughter, which made the old Mr. and Mrs. Hart very happy. They stood around the baby's crib, admiring the little one in front of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, their son had married late and there was even a possibility that he might not get married at all, which had made the elderly couple worried for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After eagerly anticipating for so long, they finally had a third generation in the family, which made the old couple feel a sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Previously, whenever they saw their friends and acquaintances having grandchildren, they could only envy them. Although they pretended not to care about having grandchildren during gatherings, they actually did care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially the old Mrs. Hart, who had avoided some of her friends' gatherings for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nowadays, when a little one is born, these two lovebirds can't wait to bring all their treasures to the little one's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Old Mrs. Hart said she wants to give her dowry jewelry to her granddaughter, while Old Mr. Hart wants to give a villa worth billions directly. Additionally, he also said he wants to give Valda a red envelope worth 1 billion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One billion?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda thought she had misheard and stared in shock at the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart. "Um... Dad, did you say one billion?" Valda hesitated and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you feel it's not enough, then add another 10 billion," said the old Mr. Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, yes, your father and I will each give 1 billion, and we'll give two red envelopes." Mrs. Hart quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda feels like she's about to faint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, she didn't faint when giving birth, but now she has an impulse to faint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does she know that the Hart family is so wealthy that they measure their wealth in billions?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it's not too little, it's too much. You don't have to give me such a big red envelope. How about you give me a few... " Valda originally wanted to say tens of thousands, but considering the Hart family's wealth, it seemed a bit inappropriate to say that. So she said, "How about a million? It's just a token of appreciation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One million, in her opinion, is already a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart immediately rejected it, saying "One million, that's not enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Valda, don't feel sorry for our money. After all, our money will eventually belong to you and Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, you are a great contributor to our Hart family. That's settled then, 2 billion!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at her in-laws and then turned to Brian lying on the hospital bed. 2 billion... This is too exaggerated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian said, "Since it's something your parents want to give you, you should accept it. That way, your parents will also be happier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you still refuse to accept, there's a chance that my parents will increase the price," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's head started to ache at the thought of this, so she turned to the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart and said, "In that case...I'll just thank my parents."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just take it." said Mr. and Mrs. Hart with a smile, as they turned their attention back to their well-behaved granddaughter, unable to take their eyes off her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa rushed to the hospital after finding out that Valda had gone into labor and was admitted in the middle of the night.</p></div>
