        <h1>Chapter 2368</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not the type who liked reading such books, but he could not help reading the novel because of her. He even... brought it to the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the book, the male and female protagonists met by chance and fell in love at first sight. After dating for a few months, they encountered an incident. The female protagonist became a murder suspect, and the male protagonist tried his best to clear his lover&rsquo;s name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone around the male protagonist advised him not to waste his time. Some even suggested that a big shot wanted to save their daughter, so they made the female protagonist a scapegoat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the male protagonist threw caution to the wind for his lover. He told the people who advised him, "Although we&rsquo;ve only been together for a few months, it feels like forever in my heart.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, the male protagonist collected all the evidence and handed it to the police. The police arrested the real murderer, and the female protagonist was acquitted and released. However, the male protagonist angered the big shot and fell into a vegetative state after the big shot's men crashed into the male protagonist with a car. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After that, the female protagonist tried to catch the real murderer to avenge her lover. She also silently stayed by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how the title suggested&mdash;&rsquo;Loving You For The Rest Of My Life&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Twenty years later, the male protagonist woke up to see white hair on the female protagonist&rsquo;s temples, but he still recognized her at a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The novel ended with the female protagonist wheeling her lover in a wheelchair to the maple forest where they first met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They looked at each other and smiled. In their hearts, they thought that it was enough for them to have each other in their lives. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When reading this book, Martin Weiss thought that the first half of the book was similar to what had happened between Kyla and him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They met by chance and fell in love with each other too. The difference was that he premeditated his approach from the start. Then, he testified against her and sent her to prison. When in truth, she was only arrested by the police after getting framed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she yearned for such romance that&rsquo;s written in novels like this... Did she hope that he had stood up for her when she was sent to prison?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss could not help smiling as he thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A relationship that had only lasted for a few months could feel like forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had spent ten years loving Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ten years... was enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was enough for him to understand that this woman could never love him back! In that case, his feelings for her were useless, so choosing hypnosis was the best choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only trying to realize a longing he once had and let himself get tired of the woman sooner, so she could no longer affect his mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I be tempted by a woman who doesn't love me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss told himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss returned to the apartment at night, he saw Kyla and Skye Maldonado in the living room. Skye Maldonado saw Martin Weiss and greeted him, "Mr. Weiss, you're back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you can go home now," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Skye Maldonado. She would not stay in the apartment at night but next door. There was a separate apartment for her to live in. She would come over to take care of Kyla when Martin Weiss was not around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Skye Maldonado left, and a sumptuous dinner was already set on the dining table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "Skye Maldonado cooked these. Would you... like to eat with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's have dinner together, then. I haven't eaten either," said Martin Weiss.</p></div>
