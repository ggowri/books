        <h1>Chapter 4098</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tie you up?" Tina was startled. "Why do I need to tie you up?" Especially since he looked like he needed to be sent to the hospital right away, why would he need to be tied up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't want anything unexpected to happen...then do it quickly!" Chandler spoke more and more laboriously, because at this moment, the worms in his body were like smelling a delicious bait, constantly stirring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His blood seemed to be converging in one place, making him feel like his rationality could collapse at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His self-control, which he had always been proud of, seemed to be easily shattered in front of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this continues, then he...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What kind of accident could happen?" Tina persisted, digging for answers. "Did you spend the night with someone? Why did your grandfather say it would make you feel better? Were you drugged by someone with ulterior motives, and the only solution is to have sex?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She began to use her vivid imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina!" Chandler suddenly shouted, lunging forward and pinning her down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> His already bloodshot eyes stared intensely at her, his face covered in sweat. The drops of sweat kept falling onto her face. "I'm not joking. If you don't want to be treated that way, you need to find a way to tie me up or knock me out. Hurry...otherwise, I will..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Suddenly, his voice stopped abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was because her hand had already wrapped around his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This simple action seemed to shatter all of his self-control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You..." He gasped for breath, his desire growing stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm willing!" Tina spoke up directly. "If it can make you feel better, Chandler, I have nothing to refuse. You don't have to worry about hurting me. I'm doing this willingly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You...you don't understand...if you know everything in the future...you will regret it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I won't regret it because I love you," she said, and her lips kissed his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> His last shred of sanity disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> With a roar, he kissed her fiercely...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> ...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When Tina woke up, she wasn't in her own room, but in Chandler's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She got up and immediately gasped for breath!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It hurts so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every bone in her body felt like it was falling apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about last night's scene, she couldn't help but blush again. But is it really okay to have that kind of thing happen in a place of prayer?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But thinking that Mr. Hunter locked them in, it should be okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the way, where is Chandler?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How is his body? Is he still in so much pain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, she quickly lifted the covers and got out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as soon as her feet touched the ground, she immediately went soft and fell forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina fell flat on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was lucky that the floor was carpeted, so the fall didn't hurt much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, there was a "click" sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately after, the door opened and Chandler walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Tina lying on the ground, Chandler quickly stepped forward, "What happened? Did you fall off the bed? Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler quickly picked up Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina blushed, not entirely due to shyness, but more due to embarrassment.</p></div>
