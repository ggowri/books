        <h1>Chapter 3110</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that's the case, then there's really no way for their film crew to make a comeback! The producer slumped into his chair and finally asked weakly, "What about the assistant who caused this mess?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The person has been detained now, and it seems that the prince's side is planning to file a lawsuit," said the assistant director.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We are also filing a lawsuit. I want that bastard to rot in jail for the rest of his life!" said the producer with anger. It's all because of this assistant that his huge investment has basically gone down the drain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda naturally wouldn't know about these things. When she woke up, she saw the hospital room and a dim light on, while outside the window it was already nighttime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian is leaning against her bedside, supporting his chin with one hand, taking a nap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked silently at Brian, who was so close to her, and her mind went back to what had happened to her earlier that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was in despair from the pain, he came and held her in his arms, making her feel incredibly relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter when, he was like her spiritual support during her suffering, pulling her out of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her gaze was fixed on his face, even though he was dozing off, his brow was still furrowed as if carrying too much on his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was he still worried about her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was thinking when suddenly Brian's eyelashes trembled slightly, and then his phoenix eyes slowly opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next moment, she felt as if she was caught in his gaze and couldn't break free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you awake? How does your leg feel now? Is it still hurting?" Brian asked anxiously, his face full of concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It doesn't hurt much now. I'm fine, thank you for saving me today," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You shouldn't thank me. You should say why I didn't protect you!" Brian murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is not your concern, Brian. Don't take the responsibility for everything on yourself," Valda said. "I don't like seeing you blame yourself all the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she really gets together with him, then his self-blame will only increase, won't it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Brian grabbed Valda's hand and said, "Valda, I'm not someone who always takes the blame for everything, but for your situation, I will definitely take the blame."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because for him, her matters are more important than his own matters!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt that the hand he was holding was burning hot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used to envy holding hands with her beloved and growing old together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, she...</p></div>
