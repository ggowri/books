        <h1>Chapter 1767</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian looked back at Jason indifferently. "Are you suspecting that I played a role in this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know you're not involved. I just want to know why you were there," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian pursed his thin lips. Even if he did not tell Jason the reason now, he would have to tell the police later and Jason would still find out eventually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"A crew member in Hart Group&rsquo;s film and television company requested for gunpowder but the amount far exceeded what was needed. I randomly had someone check it out, only to trace it to some people who are huge fans of Lily. Eventually, I discovered Lily&rsquo;s trail as well. I was going to wait until I had an exact account of Lily's whereabouts before informing the police, but I didn't expect..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You didn't expect Lily's plans to go beyond your expectations, did you?" Jason asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian pressed his lips together and said nothing. He knew that the explosives had been carried up the hill, but he wondered what Lily wanted to do with them. Hence, he secretly went up the mountain, only to see Lily, Sean, and Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">From their conversation, he found out Mason was the child Grace and Jason had yet to find!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had planned to wait for the best opportunity to rescue Mason, but everything changed so quickly that he was caught off guard. He did not expect that Lily even included Sean in her plot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know you saved Grace and Mason today. I'll return the favor!" Jason's cold voice continued ringing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian suddenly chuckled. "You don't have to return the favor to me for saving Grace and Mason!" Besides, Grace had already done that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was good enough for him that she had reached out to him and held his hand so tightly when the hill collapsed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Brian, Grace is my wife!" Jason's tone was icy with a hint of rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The corners of Brian's lips showed a tinge of sarcasm. "So what? Jason, I&rsquo;ve never cared about whether Grace is your wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would not quit just because Grace did not love him back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how hard he tried, Grace loved Jason. It was the same five years ago and the same five years later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... Grace disregarded the condition of her hands to hold him today. She refused to let go till the last moment, and that was good enough for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would remember the events today until his death. He would remember how the woman he loved was willing to save him in such a way even though she might never fall in love with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian looked at his right hand as he spoke. His left hand could not help gently touching his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had saved him at the cost of her hands, and he would be devoted to her for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she ever needed him to do anything for her, he would be willing to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After seeing Brian&rsquo;s actions, Jason's eyes darkened instantly. "Even though Grace saved you today, it doesn't mean anything. It's just because you saved her and Mason first."</p></div>
