        <h1>Chapter 3335</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, we should go register at the place for finding missing persons. It's just a pity that the police only have DNA data for the Abbott couple and not for Lawrence!" Grace said regretfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If there is DNA data available, the chances of finding Lawrence will be much higher as long as he is still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, as time passes, the appearance of children at this age will also change significantly. Moreover, if Lawrence suffers from amnesia and forgets the past, it will be even more difficult to find him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The DNA data, on the other hand, will not change no matter how many years have passed, making it a strong piece of evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them discussed some ways to find the missing person. Philip checked the time and realized it was already past 10 o'clock without him noticing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's getting late, William and I should go back," said Philip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go call out William," Grace stood up and walked towards her daughter's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she pushed open the door, she saw two children lying on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper leaned against William's chest, tears still streaking down her face, while William held her in a comforting embrace, as if consoling her from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace looked at the two children, and a soft expression crossed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their behavior reminded her of a situation from a few years ago. At that time, William had not yet returned to the Barlow family and was living with the Reed family. Jasper often slept with William and would sometimes bring him to her room or go to his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes fate can be so strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, she never imagined that one day Lily's child would become friends with her own child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her imprisonment back then was all because of Lily's selfishness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Lily ultimately got what she deserved for the past grudges of the previous generation. She only wanted to leave them in the past and not pass them on to the next generation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper and William getting along so well is actually really great, maybe it's even some kind of destiny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I hope William can really make his daughter happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace approached and gently tucked in the blankets for the two children before leaving the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back downstairs, she turned to Philip and said, "William is asleep now, so I think we should let him spend the night here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Asleep?" Philip raised his eyebrows and then smiled slightly. "Then I'll trouble you to take care of William for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No problem at all. William came here specifically to comfort Jasper, and I'm grateful," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, on the bed in Jasper's room, William, who should have been asleep, slowly opened his eyes and looked at Jasper, who was already asleep next to him. His beautiful dark eyes seemed to be thinking about something.</p></div>
