        <h1>Chapter 3385</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler is now 15 years old, a young man who is usually mature and steady. Although Brian hasn't met him many times, he knows something about Chandler's personality and behavior from Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hearing this, he turned to Lornell and said, "Alright, come with me. I'll take you to Harley's attending physician."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley's attending physician was staying at the hospital because Harley was in a critical period these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian found him and faced a child like Lornell, he was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially since Lornell wanted to see Harley's medical records.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This..." The attending physician looked at Brian and Valda, after all, medical records are the patient's privacy, and moreover, the other party is just a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let him see it," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did the attending physician hand over Harley's medical report to Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell lowered his head and began to read it carefully, turning the pages one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, everyone except Chandler and Lornell's subordinates looked surprised. Could this child really understand these data?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell understood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And precisely because he understood, his inner unease was expanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley is currently in a dangerous situation. If we follow the treatment plan listed in her medical records, there's a high chance she won't wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once 72 hours have passed, the chance of her waking up is very low. Even if she does wake up, her brain may have been affected and there could be many lasting effects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell's lips were tightly pursed. If they wanted to save the little guy, as Chandler had said earlier, they would need the help of those old monsters from the Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... they won't act recklessly, even if he is the young master and heir of the Quentin family. It's not easy to control those people!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell thought for a moment, then had his subordinate hand him a phone. He dialed a number and said, "I need your help to save someone. I'll fax you her medical report."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Save people? What people?" the other person asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The daughter of Hart Group, Harley, is three years old," answered Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't help." On the other end of the phone, the response was firm and resolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I insist that you save me?" said Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's something you can say after you inherit the Quentin family in the future," said the person on the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inheriting the Quentin family is something that can only happen after Lornell comes of age, but Harley's treatment cannot be delayed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will marry her in the future," said Lornell suddenly from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When these words were spoken, not only did the voice on the other end of the phone fall silent, but even the people present were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian and Valda were at a loss for words, not knowing what to say to each other at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The voice on the other end of the phone asked Lornell, "What did you say? You should know that engagement matters are not something that can be decided so casually, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why can Chandler get engaged to Tina, but I can't?" Lornell asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Here, Chandler was speechless. If it weren't for the inappropriate timing, he probably would have had a good talk with Lornell right then and there!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did the Hart family agree to it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Agreed," Lornell quickly said. "Anyway, you should hurry and try to get here within three hours. Her condition is not good right now!"</p></div>
