        <h1>Chapter 4256 The Reason</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed by minute by minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air became oppressively strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so quiet all around, except for the audible sobbing under the table, which was so obvious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler stiffened his body, his mind almost blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one voice constantly shouting in his heart, please don't let it be Tina...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But sometimes, the more afraid you are of something happening, the more likely it will happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he bent down and slowly lifted the tablecloth that had fallen, he finally saw the figure hiding under the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was instantly shocked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That familiar figure caught his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Tina!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tina at this moment had tears all over her face, and her expressions were so different from the ones he was familiar with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes, blinking non-stop, were filled with tears, causing him heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina..." he called out in a hoarse voice, "please come out first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip hard, and after a long while, she slowly emerged from under the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here?" he raised his hand, wanting to wipe away the tears on her face, but she suddenly took a step back, avoiding his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand awkwardly stayed suspended in mid-air, with a trace of bitterness in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You heard what my grandfather and I were talking about just now?" he said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I heard it all!" she said in a nasal voice, "I didn't know, but I couldn't sleep at night, and </span><span>I accidentally walked into this room, and I actually heard those words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler withdrew his hand with a pale face and stood there quietly as if he was a person about to be judged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina took a deep breath, "I don't want any misunderstandings between us, so I have a few questions to ask you, but I hope you can be honest with me, without any concealment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her and said, "Sure, ask me whatever questions you have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the deal with the umbilical cord blood-saving lives?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Hunter family has a curse that can be inherited by children, but this inheritance is not certain, it could be skipped a generation or several generations. But those who are affected by this curse will experience periodic excruciating pain. This pain may last a few minutes or hours and usually occurs within two to three days. After enduring these two to three days, the pain will subside for some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if they can't endure it?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they can't endure it, they will commit suicide," he said, there have been many suicides among the ancestors of the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's body trembled, seemingly not expecting this kind of answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the umbilical cord blood-saving lives, a person affected by this curse will have a connection with a certain opposite-sex individual. If they have a child with this </span><span>person</span><span> they have a connection with, the placenta and umbilical cord blood of the child can be used to create a medicine that can lift the curse," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina tightly pursed her lips, seemingly contemplating his words. After a long while, she asked, "So now, you are affected by this curse, and I am the opposite-sex individual you have a connection with?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did you know that I was the person you had a connection with?" she stared at him and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body stiffened even more, "...Before you were born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Tina was taken aback, "Before I was born? Are you referring to when I was still a fetus?"</span></p></div>
