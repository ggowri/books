        <h1>Chapter 3100</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla pursed her lips and after a while said, "Even if there isn't, it's not a big deal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I not only don't have any photos, I also don't have the feelings we once had together." Although he remembers some memorable things, some small memories have already faded away. And as time passes, even the memories he still remembers seem to be becoming more and more blurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like humans... the more emotional something is, the more memorable it becomes, while the less emotional something is, the more blurry the memory becomes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's because the brain determines that those things are not important and can be forgotten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And what about him? Will he not only forget the past feelings, but also forget this memory if time goes on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he really forgets everything, does that mean his past is nothing but a blank slate?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have them, they're just buried within you right now. But at least those emotions exist. Maybe one day, when you want to reclaim them, they can come back," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, if I'm willing to recover now?" Martin asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla stared at the man in front of her, feeling a bit stunned and unable to react for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin put down the photo album and stood up, staring at Kyla intently. "I can retrieve the memories that were hypnotized and I can undo the hypnosis. I also know what happened between us in the past. However, for me now, those past experiences are like watching a TV drama performed by strangers. I don't know how I will react when those feelings come back, when I truly feel the pain and despair of that time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her expression was complicated, but she understood what he said. What he worried about was also what she worried about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kyla, do you want me to restore it?" Martin asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Kyla hesitated. Once upon a time, she could confidently give an answer, but now she was uncertain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They want him to recover, but they are also afraid that it will destroy the warm and peaceful life they have worked so hard to build.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Initially, the secret phrase I set for undoing the hypnosis was a sentence that you had to say with your own mouth. I wrote this sentence on a piece of paper and placed it in your bedside table. If you wanted to undo my hypnosis, all you had to do was say this sentence in front of me. However, if you didn't want to undo it, then you should never say this sentence to me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla, listen, there's a mixed feeling inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had desperately wanted to know the secret words to hypnotism, but never succeeded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he was planning to simply put it in her bedside table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He left the decision up to her, and she had to decide whether to release herself from the hypnosis or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin opened his arms and embraced Kyla, "Kyla, whatever decision you make, I will accept it. But if in the future... if I really have conflicts with you because of the hypnotism and the past feelings, please don't give up on me, because the fact that I love you has never changed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I understand," Kyla hugged Martin back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, he had always loved her, from the past to the present, and she believed that he would continue to love her in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If only they had more trust in each other in the beginning, maybe they could have avoided some of the obstacles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps they could have been very happy... very happy...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">***</p></div>
