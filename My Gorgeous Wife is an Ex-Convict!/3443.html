        <h1>Chapter 3441</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong, Mr. Cross? Do you have something to say?" asked Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is your affection for Mason really just brotherly love?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback, then her expression changed. "If it's not a sibling relationship, what kind of relationship could it be? Do you also think, Mr. Cross, that Mason and I should be like those rumors that are circulating around school?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Daniel hesitated for a moment, seeming unsure of what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And his silence made her think that he really thought that way. Suddenly, her heart sank. "Since Mr. Cross thinks the same way, I have nothing to argue about. Our paths are not the same. Mason and I will leave first. Goodbye, Mr. Cross."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica walked towards the direction of the cash register as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing this, Daniel hurriedly chased after Veronica and grabbed her wrist, stopping her in her tracks. "Wait, I...I didn't mean it like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What does that mean?" Veronica asked. "To me, Mason is my brother and I am his sister. Our relationship is that simple. What does Mr. Cross think it is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel looked at the person in front of him. Her eyes were clear and without any hint of guilt or concealment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, her feelings towards Mason are truly those of sibling affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Mason may not feel the same way about her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, Mr. Cross, please let go. I need to go find Mason," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel hesitated, feeling that if he let go, he would surely regret it in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took a deep breath and then, as if summoning all his courage, he said loudly, "I...I like you, Veronica. Would you be my girlfriend if you're willing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his confession, everyone around heard it and suddenly many people's eyes turned towards them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned, her eyes widened in surprise as she looked at Daniel. She never expected that Daniel would publicly confess his feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some young people around them started cheering, "Wow, this guy is really brave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Say yes to him, come on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is public confession a trend these days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face slowly turned red, showing shyness, embarrassment, and a hint of joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel... likes her. This fact actually made her heart leap with joy. When she used to read shoujo manga, she had fantasized about what it would be like if she met someone she liked in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, those fantasies seem to be turning into reality... except it's happening in this kind of situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, there is a pair of eyes watching this scene not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's face is full of coldness, and his fingers keep tightening the two books in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't expect Daniel to suddenly confess like this, and what kind of answer will Veronica give him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to?" Daniel's gaze was burning, full of expectation as he looked at Veronica.</p></div>
