        <h1>Chapter 887</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's hands were still around Jason's neck. She looked at the familiar face right in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... Jason. The Jay I can... rely on&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, you know what? I'm so happy&hellip; today..." she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He furrowed his eyebrows. "Happy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah... Happy... It was as if by dancing along as I looked at the people on the stage, I could forget a lot of troubles..." she went on muttering. Only what was it that she was trying to forget? She could not recall all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, holding Jay like this made her feel secure as if she finally had a long-lost peace of mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina... said that the five people singing and dancing on stage today... are very popular recently...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina likes the one with gray hair best, but... Uh... I prefer the one with black hair... I think Asian men look best with black hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I tried to grab their clothes too. They would throw them off the stage one by one&hellip; Lina said... if I really like the vest she grabbed, she would give it to me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace rambled on, Terrence could feel the air pressure in the car getting lower and lower. He was literally screaming in his head for Grace to stop talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who knew if Master Reed would lose his temper if she continued?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? You like the black-haired one?" Jason's cold voice rang in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence secretly sympathized with the black-haired member of the band.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," Grace nodded her head as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, the atmosphere in the car seemed to be tense to the extreme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, what she said made Terrence breathe a huge sigh of relief</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However... I like my Jay the best," murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes immediately softened. 'My Jay...' She seemed to have liked using such a term a long time ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she and he were part of a family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she ran her hand from his neck to his hair, her fingers messed up his hair. "Jay has the most&hellip; Most beautiful black hair..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He allowed her fingers to run wildly through his hair while he held her in his arms a little closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This long-lost intimacy unexpectedly made him feel like he had found a treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she could treat him that intimately again only when she was drunk, he wished she could stay drunk forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to the neighborhood of Grace's rental house. Jason got out of the car with Grace in his arms and went into the rental house. Then, he told Terrence, "Wait outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," answered Terrence as he stood at the door of the rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason carried Grace to her bed and made her sit on the bed while he bent his knees and squatted down. He then carefully took off her shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His movements were so gentle as if he was afraid he might hurt her if he was any more forceful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason who had lowered himself in front of her while in a daze. Suddenly, she reached out her hand and touched his head, saying, "Good boy, Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He trembled slightly and raised his jaw a little. Those bright eyes of his were staring right at her. "Will you like me if I've been good?"</p></div>
