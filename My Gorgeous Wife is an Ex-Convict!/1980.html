        <h1>Chapter 1978</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Um... He was indeed &lsquo;obedient&rsquo;! Grace could not help smiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After seeing Mason making a video call, Jasper also wanted to call her dad and William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Be good now. Coming here is our little secret. Didn't we agree on keeping this from Daddy for a while? How about this? I'll call Uncle Kwan and ask him to get William to have a video call with you,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had an agreement with the children not to tell Jay about coming here. As for Mrs. Watts's real identity as their grandmother, Grace planned to tell them when they were older.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, there was more to it than what a few words could explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Jasper soon held Grace's phone and had a video call with William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace then asked her oldest son, "Is there anyone you want to video call? &hellip; Except Daddy, of course."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one shook his head. He did not have anyone in particular that he wanted to have a video call with. He could not understand why Mason and Jasper were so happy to make those video calls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if the people they were video calling were important to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The people who mattered to him were his parents, Mason, Jasper. The others... did not matter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, Grace looked at her three children who were already sound asleep and smiled. Then, she took out her phone and sent a short text message to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace: [We're safe. Don't miss us.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That was all she sent out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In Reed Residence, Jason looked at the text message on his phone and his slender fingers gently swiped over every word on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How can I not worry? Grace, come back soon. I miss you," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He missed her so much. He missed her warmth, her scent, her everything...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Good night." He slowly uttered the two words and kissed the message on his phone screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'They're safe. Don't miss them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'They're safe. Don't miss them!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, every word seemed to be engraved in his mind. Then, his heart was full of &lsquo;longing&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In a presidential suite in Emerald City's famous five-star hotel, a tall, handsome man looked through the photos on the coffee table. All of which were of William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Except, he was not looking into the camera in any of them. It was obvious that they were taken secretly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is this the child Lily gave birth to?" the man asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, but we're not 100% certain because Lily is already dead. There's no way we can do a DNA test." Standing in front of the man was a thin man in his 40s with a scruffy beard. He was a well-known private investigator in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It doesn't matter. I'm not trying to prove whether he's related to Lily anyway. Find a way to get me his blood or hair sample," the man said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's not a problem," the private investigator said. After all, in his opinion, it was just a child staying with the Reed family. How hard could it be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Also, I don't want anyone else to find out about this. You know what will happen if I ever find out that you revealed it to anyone else," the man said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The private investigator froze and immediately replied, "Yes, yes, I understand. No one else will find out about this!"</p></div>
