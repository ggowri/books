        <h1>Chapter 1143</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He must first follow his heart to make a choice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know how to rebuke Brian's words for a moment, and silence fell between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the seat beside Grace became empty as a passenger got up to get off the bus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you wanna sit? Or do you wanna stand with me?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips and sat down on the seat. At least if she sat while he stood, then the distance between them would not be so close and the pressure would not be so obvious either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a moment later, she completely took back what she thought earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked over to her seat, resting his hands on the seat&rsquo;s handle. He was tall. As he did so, his back naturally bent slightly and it looked like he was imprisoning her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only awkwardly lower her head and look down, trying to ignore Brian who was standing next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was a dozen stations away from where she lived, at least 40 minutes away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace simply closed her eyes and pretended to doze off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked down at the figure sitting in the seat. From his point of view, he could see her black hair, arched eyebrows, closed eyes, and small nose tip... She looked so adorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When did he fall in love with her and become attracted to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was because of her appearance at the beginning, then later, he seemed to have gradually yearned for her day and night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not even tell what attracted him. Was it her forbearance, sense of justice, or... Did falling in love with someone have no reason? Love was love?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the bus went past station after station, Brian could only see Grace's head gradually becoming like a chicken pecking at rice as she swayed slightly with the movement of the bus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was interesting to him. Come to think of it, it was the first time a woman had napped in this way... when facing him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were anyone else, he would not have given them a second glance. However, she made him unable to get enough of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the bus swerved, and Grace's head shook with the inertia. She was about to hit the glass window when Brian quickly put his hand between the glass window and Grace's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Brian felt a strange sensation in the palm of his hand as her head gently bumped into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a rare sense of satisfaction as if he could do anything for her. Even the smallest things could make him happy. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the bus drove on, Brian kept his hand between Grace's head and the window to prevent her from hitting her head on the glass window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time her head bumped into his palm, a faint smile appeared on the corners of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so warm and harmonious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyone could see the rare dotingness in the man's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly woke up as the bus reached the terminal, and the loudspeaker continued to blast the sound to signal all passengers to get down from the bus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did... she fall asleep? She had just faked it earlier, not expecting to actually fall asleep!</p></div>
