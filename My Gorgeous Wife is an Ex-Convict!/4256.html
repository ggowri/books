        <h1>Chapter 4254 Hearing</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?" She still had her eyes wide open, waiting for his answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." He replied softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she truly fell in love with him, he wouldn't suppress or overcome his impulse towards her anymore. She could have whatever she wanted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina shrugged, "Alright then, I'll sleep in the guest room!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when night came, Tina couldn't fall asleep no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got up and put on a coat, walking out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hunter family was a completely new and unfamiliar environment to her, yet she didn't feel it was that unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it was because she had been here before, even though she didn't have that memory, her body might still remember.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of her mind, there seemed to be an inexplicable calling, urging her on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina unconsciously walked to the door of a room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This room's door was different from the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That intangible urging in her heart seemed to have become even more apparent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina hesitated and pushed the door open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her sight was a portrait and a table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The table was adorned with various offerings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The portrait depicted a beautiful woman, but her gaze carried a trace of resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was this woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Tina's heart rate suddenly accelerated. She felt as if a memory was appearing in her mind, but it was just a blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if there was something important that she should remember!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't remember it now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, there was suddenly a commotion outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was startled and instinctively hid under the table, her body covered by the tablecloth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as she hid, she realized why she was hiding. Even if she wasn't hiding, it wouldn't matter. If someone saw her, she could simply say that she had entered the wrong room or something like that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, someone had already entered, and the door of the room was pushed open at this moment, and someone walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, it would be awkward to crawl out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> Tina could only continue to crouch under the table, hoping that the person who came in would leave quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want that Stephenson girl to give birth to your child as soon as possible?" the voice of an old man suddenly resounded in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback. This voice was the voice of old Mr. Hunter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> the person being asked by old Mr. Hunter at this moment would be...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tina was thinking this, the familiar voice had already spoken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When to have a child should be Tina's decision, not mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if she never wants to have another one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we won't have one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&mdash;" Old Mr. Hunter glared at Chandler with anger, "Why are you so disappointing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Tina's state of mind was completely different from old Mr. Hunter's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a hint of sweetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed as he promised, not pressuring her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next sentence from old Mr. Hunter made her suddenly freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget, what was your purpose for getting close to Tina in the first place? After all these years by her side, are you planning to give up?" the old Mr. Hunter said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback, purpose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Chandler accompanying her for a reason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't forgotten," Chandler said, and the pain in his body reminded him of that purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you haven't forgotten, then you should make Tina give birth to the child as soon as possible. Don't forget, only the umbilical cord blood of the child she and you have can save your life. The umbilical cord blood of the first child is already gone, you can only have another one!" the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p></div>
