        <h1>Chapter 3952</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the live electronic sports competition was very exciting, and soon Nancy's attention was completely focused on the game, gradually forgetting everything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she immersed herself in the atmosphere of the competition, she would become tense with the intense situation of the game and applaud for the players' brilliant moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the final round ended with the player's amazing moves, Nancy excitedly grabbed Mick next to her and exclaimed, "Did you see that? The last combo move was so amazing, the player's prediction was incredible, it was like they knew exactly what the opponent was going to do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was amazing, so amazing! And the teamwork between those two players, no wonder the commentator said they were a golden duo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're so talented, are these really esports players? How can they be so strong! It's a shame I don't play this game, otherwise I really want to try playing against them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy chattered on and on, only to realize that she was almost hugging Mick while saying all this due to her excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry..." she said awkwardly, quickly letting go of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick sneered lightly, "There's no need to apologize, I don't dislike your behavior just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned, does this mean that his liking for her is increasing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... let's go," she changed the subject, got up and headed towards the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the end of the event, and many people were gradually walking towards the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Nancy had only taken a few steps when a hand suddenly grabbed hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused and turned to look at Mick, who was holding her hand. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's crowded here, so we won't get separated," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But being led by Mick's hand in the crowd made Nancy's heart beat wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His warmth was constantly transmitted to her hand as they walked hand in hand, just like an ordinary couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when someone squeezed past her, his other hand would lift up to protect her shoulder, preventing her from being bumped by others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she was being carefully looked after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looked after?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy lowered her gaze, a hint of self-mockery flashing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How long had it been since she had felt the feeling of being looked after? Even when her mother was alive, she wouldn't show any care for her because her mother was always trying to please the Schultz family and Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for her mother sacrificing herself to save her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of her mother's death, her heart felt bitter again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two of them walked out of the competition venue, Nancy went to a nearby restroom. As she was washing her hands at the sink, a young woman walked over and was also washing her hands. However, the woman's gaze was fixed on her reflection in the mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the woman's gaze was too direct, Nancy couldn't help but furrow her brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she finished washing her hands and was about to leave, the woman suddenly spoke up, "You're... Nancy, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was taken aback, "And you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Jasper, Mick's sister." The woman introduced herself generously, "I've seen the video of you and my brother taken by someone before... so, I recognize you."</span></p></div>
