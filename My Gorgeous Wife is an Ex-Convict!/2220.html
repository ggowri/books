        <h1>Chapter 2218</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent and ignored Mr. Lambert. She did not want to entertain the crowd in the room, but Mr. Lambert thought Kyla had tacitly admitted to what he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's eyes glimmered when she heard Mr. Lambert say &lsquo;a woman who had been to prison.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that aside from having to conceive a son, the fact that she had been to prison was a big problem if a homewrecker like her wanted an official title. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Neal Reid's wife had only given birth to a daughter. If she could conceive a son and help Neal Reid get in touch with Martin Weiss, the possibility of her getting a title would be greater!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the thought of this, she pretended to look like she was doing this for Kyla's own good and whispered, "Kyla, I'm sorry. I just wanted to treat you to a meal. I didn't expect things to turn out like this. But Neal's friends are all rich. With our situation, the more we can get, the better. It'll help to secure our future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Kyla asked indifferently. She had never told Jacqueline Bowman about her relationship with Martin Weiss, but everyone in the private room knew Martin Weiss was the father of her baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think about it, perhaps Jacqueline Bowman saw Martin Weiss when she came to the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The neighbor also said that Martin Weiss's car was often parked near the store, and Martin Weiss would watch the store while sitting inside the car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, everything was premeditated. Jacqueline Bowman did it because of Martin Weiss, which explained why she took so much effort in coming to her store and inviting her out. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I'm going to harm you? We're friends, after all," muttered Jacqueline Bowman. However, the way she looked at Kyla was with traces of guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the private room, Neal Reid told everyone to help themselves to the food and drinks. He also ordered some desserts suitable for pregnant women, but Kyla did not touch her chopsticks, nor did she drink. Even though Jacqueline Bowman tried to persuade Kyla to eat, she still refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The atmosphere suddenly turned a little awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert instantly slammed his chopsticks on the table and shouted at Kyla, "What's with the attitude? Do you think you're all that just because you're Martin Weiss's woman? Men like him have a lot of women. Who do you think you are? Your pregnancy doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. Believe it or not. I can make you drink in front of him and he won't even say a word."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who's drinking?" The private room door was pushed open. A voice rang and interrupted Mr. Lambert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in the private room froze as they saw a tall figure walking in. It was none other than Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was wearing a navy blue suit, while his hair was neatly combed. He looked noble and elegant. However, his face looked slightly pale under the lights. When Kyla's eyes fell on Martin Weiss's hand, she saw that it was wrapped with white bandages. It seemed that he had gone to the hospital to treat his wound yesterday. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss came in with several bodyguards. The tall and burly bodyguards immediately made those inside the private room feel oppressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expressions of the other people in the private room instantly changed when they saw this. Neal Reid hurriedly got up and said, "Mr. Weiss. Hello, I'm Neal Reid. We've met in an exchange conference."</p></div>
