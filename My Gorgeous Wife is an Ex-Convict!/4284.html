        <h1>Chapter 4282 Not Understanding Him</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tina left Chandler's villa, she felt an indescribable exhaustion throughout her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shouldn't they avoid meeting privately until he removes the curse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was the one who initiated the divorce, why is she the one feeling lost now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler hasn't told her what happened to the people from the Hunter family who caused the curse, which makes her uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She feels like things aren't that simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, there is a simpler way to remove his curse and relieve his pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is to have another child between them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they have the umbilical cord blood and placenta from the child, the problem can be solved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he rejected this condition that she proposed at the cost of divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said he didn't need her to have another child because of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he refused this condition, she was relieved at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, when she truly sees Chandler in pain, she wonders if this can really work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can she just let him suffer like this, and let him be tormented by the Quentin family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tina returned to her residence, Lina rushed to greet her. "Did you stay at Chandler's place last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she received a call from her daughter last night, saying that something came up and she wouldn't be coming back to sleep, their relationship is not the same as before, so it still worried her for a night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," Tina replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But didn't you two get divorced? Why did you stay at his place for a night?" Lina asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He got injured, so I... stayed with him," Tina hesitated and gave a reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Injured?!" Lina was shocked. "Where did Chandler get injured? Is it serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He cut his palm with glass, the doctor has treated it, it's just a superficial wound, didn't affect his hand nerves," Tina explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good." Lina breathed a sigh of relief, but then she became puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because Chandler injured his hand, her daughter stayed with him for a night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current Tina is not the same as the past Tina who deeply loved Chandler! Why would she stay with him? Did something else happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since her daughter didn't say anything, Lina chose not to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she will be a solid support for her daughter when she needs it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Chandler's situation, Tina couldn't let it go, so she made an appointment with Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, why did you suddenly ask me out for dinner?" Harley asked strangely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, since Tina lost her memories, they only met at some family gatherings and would talk about some past events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they never met privately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know about the Quentin family since you and Lornell are engaged?" Tina asked openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not really," Harley answered truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina paused for a moment. "I heard you and Lornell have been engaged for many years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," Harley said. "The engagement was arranged when I was 3 years old."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled sweetly as she spoke, saying that it was Lornell who insisted on saving her, which is why she survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she might not be in this world right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Quentin family is a member of the Crypt families. I only know that the Quentin family is highly skilled in medicine, but I'm not sure to what extent. I only know that when I was three years old, many doctors said I couldn't be saved, but when the Quentin family came to save me, I was saved!" Harley said.</span></p></div>
