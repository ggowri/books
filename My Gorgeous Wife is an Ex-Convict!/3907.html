        <h1>Chapter 3905</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, their grandfather had passed away, and their grandmother lived in another city and rarely visited. Their mother would take them to see their grandmother once a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But their grandmother wouldn't come to Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later, she curiously asked her elder brother what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her brother only said it was a matter of grievances from the previous generation, related to their grandfather. Her father never forgave her grandmother, so he made her promise to never enter Emerald City for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for her grandfather's death, she actually knew a little bit about it. It seemed that her grandfather was kicked out of the Reed family by their great-grandfather because he wanted to marry her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, her grandmother left her grandfather because of his downfall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her grandfather seemed to have passed away not long after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the stories she knew, her grandmother seemed like a bad woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the grandmother she knew was so kind and gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her grandmother loved to hear them talk about her father. Every time they talked about him, her grandmother listened with great interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wondered if one day her father would go to see her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Jason looked at the baby's eyes, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Grace came to the reception room, everyone learned that Veronica had woken up, so they went to the next room to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper curiously asked Veronica how painful childbirth was, while Jasmine asked, "Sister-in-law, did Mason cry in the delivery room? When he came out, his eyes were red, but when I asked him, he said he didn't cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she clearly felt that Mason had cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this question, the room suddenly became quiet, and everyone's eyes turned to Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's face showed a rare look of embarrassment, with a slight blush on his cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Second sister-in-law?" Jasmine stared at Veronica, waiting for her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, your second sister-in-law just woke up not long ago. She needs to rest now. Let's go back and let Mason accompany her well!" Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I haven't..." Jasmine was about to say something, but Jasper had already covered her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that when she gets home, she needs to have a good talk with her carefree little sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, only Veronica, Mason, and the little one who had fallen asleep remained in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at Mason, who was blushing, and couldn't help but smile. "Speaking of which, I didn't expect to see you cry like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was just too worried about you..." Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he was worried, and then... scared... scared that something would happen to her, scared that he would lose her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just thinking about these things made his body tremble uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So much so that he didn't even know that his tears could flow so suddenly and unexpectedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry for making you cry." Veronica slowly raised her hand and this time, she finally touched his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her arm was still sore, it was not as weak as it was in the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her palm was on his cheek, giving off a warm feeling.</p></div>
