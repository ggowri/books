        <h1>Chapter 1791</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No thanks. I'll wait for her in the hospital. I want to see Grace come out of the operating room," said Lina. Besides, even if she went back now, she would probably be restless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Me too. I came here to accompany Grace through the surgery," added Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence then looked at Jason. Jason said to Lina and Kyla, "Let Terrence know if you two need anything. He'll take care of it for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, Jason sat alone on the bench in front of the operating room, sitting quietly with his head half down. He was waiting for the result of the surgery!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the way Jason looked, Kyla was happy for Grace. Grace had met the right person. Even though she previously separated from Jason because of all sorts of reasons and even though... Jason had once forgotten Grace, the person he loved had always been her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not easy to meet your true love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And I...' Kyla thought of herself. She and Martin Weiss had exhausted their feelings after all the misunderstandings and mistakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She used to think it was hard not to love Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she later realized that it was not that difficult not to love someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had the liver Martin Weiss donated in her body. She could let go of her hatred toward Martin Weiss and forgive him, but she would not love him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After she made it clear with him near the store, Martin Weiss's car did not appear around the store anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was best if they stopped seeing each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, a sudden retching sound came from Kyla's side. She saw Lina covering her mouth as she hurriedly got up from the chair and ran toward the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla frowned a little. She also got up and walked toward the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina threw up into the toilet. After throwing up for some time and there was nothing else to throw up, she took a long breath and stepped out of the cubicle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She met Kyla as soon as she got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina walked to the sink, gargled, and wiped her mouth with a tissue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you okay?" Kyla asked with a touch of worry in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina laughed at herself and shook her head. "I'm fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you..." Kyla seemed to be choosing her words hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I&rsquo;m pregnant," Lina said honestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla froze. Although she had speculated as such after hearing Lina throw up for so long, she was still surprised to hear her admit it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is it... Hadwin Stephenson's child?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's shoulders instantly slumped. "Is it that easy to guess? I thought it&rsquo;d be hard to guess whose baby I&rsquo;m carrying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Hadwin Stephenson is the only person you&rsquo;ve loved. Besides, didn't you run into him again some time ago? So it's not that hard to guess," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What she did not say was that with Lina's character, if a man she did not love had gotten her pregnant, she would probably take him to court!</p></div>
