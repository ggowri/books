        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was grabbed by the wrist by William and they walked out of the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, what are you doing?" Jasper asked, confused. They were leaving like this for no reason, and he didn't know what their classmates would say about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William stopped and turned to Jasper. "If we stayed there, how would you answer Roger's question?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper froze and bit his lip, not saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His dark eyes narrowed. "Are you planning to agree to date him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course not!" Jasper quickly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her response relieved him. "So, is it a rejection then?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," Jasper said. "I just don't know how to say it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why can't you decide?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because he might be Lawrence," Jasper said. "If he really is Lawrence, then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, if you reject him, are you afraid he'll be hurt and upset?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper nodded. He knew her too well. She couldn't hide anything from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if he really is Lawrence?" he pressed. "If it's not just a possibility, but he really is Lawrence, would you agree to date him because you're afraid he'll be hurt and upset?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked, looking puzzled. "But if I'm not dating him because I like him and want to be his girlfriend, wouldn't he be even more hurt and upset?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she said this, he was momentarily speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Did I say something wrong?" she asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He chuckled, "No, you didn't say anything wrong. It's true that if that person really likes you, then you're not dating them just because you like them, and it will indeed make them even more upset!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, she had a more insightful perspective on the issue than he had imagined, and it was he who was caught up in this meaningless dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But actually, now that I think about it, he probably doesn't really want to date me," Jasper added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you feel that way?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because he didn't show any interest in me before. I was the one who pursued him, and he knew it was because he looks like Lawrence. But when he asked me out in front of everyone, he put me in a difficult position. I think he did it even though he knew it would make us both uncomfortable. So, I don't think he really likes me. If he truly liked someone, he wouldn't want to embarrass them in front of others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As William listened to Jasper's analysis, he realized that she was even better at analyzing situations than he had thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He used to think she was naive and easily fooled, but the Reed family had sheltered her too much from the harsh realities of the world. However, she understood things that she should have understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you know he's not sincere, why are you afraid of rejecting him and hurting his feelings?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because of his face," Jasper muttered.</p></div>
