        <h1>Chapter 908</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt a sensation in his stomach that he could not even express!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the car stopped in front of a hotel. Martin Weiss got out, and Kyla followed suit while holding Nelson's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The place Martin Weiss stayed was naturally the hotel's presidential suite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Nelson's first time in a presidential suite. Everything here was full of wonder to him. Even just looking at the 70-inch LCD TV screen, his eyes were wide with curiosity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after the initial feeling of novelty, the little one gradually became sleepy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was supposed to nap after lunch, but he was so excited earlier about taking the high-speed train that he could not fall asleep. Now that they had gotten to the hotel, he immediately fell asleep like a log.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her son who was asleep in her arms and said to Martin Weiss, "Can Nelson sleep in this room? If there's anything you want to talk to me about, we'll talk about it in another room. I don't want him to hear things children his age shouldn't hear about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing that, Martin Weiss's eyes darkened slightly as he left the room without a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla went to the bedside and carefully put the child on the bed before gently covering him with a thin quilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand caressed her son's tender cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that some things were inevitable after all. Even so, she wanted to keep Nelson by her side no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to grow old with her son by her side, and she wanted to see Nelson with a bright future&mdash;a future she never had!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not notice Martin Weiss looking at her with mixed feelings in his eyes from outside the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never imagined seeing her as a mother one day. However, he could not turn his eyes away when she laid the child so carefully on the bed and looked at him with such gentle eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he wanted to keep on looking at her like this, forever and ever&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took a deep breath before getting up. She walked out of the room and closed the door gently. Then, she looked at Martin Weiss and asked, "What do you want to talk about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you go to all this trouble to avoid me because of this child?" Martin Weiss asked coldly. At the same time, he silently mocked himself for the sudden feeling he had of wanting to keep on looking at her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does this woman make me want to keep looking at her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hid from you because I don't want to see you again. Mr. Weiss, you must have forgotten what I said. Even in hell, I hope we'd never meet again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression immediately changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words had been like a nightmare all these years, constantly appearing in his dreams and waking him up from his sleep!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss snapped, saying, "That's enough! Kyla, are you that against seeing me? Alas, I'd like to see you. I never expected you to be more daring than I thought. How dare you give birth to my child?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even without a DNA test, Nelson's age and eyes that were similar to his had convinced him that this was his child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yours?" Kyla suddenly chuckled. "Martin Weiss, how dare you say that? Have you forgotten that you told me there was no way I could ever have your baby and that even if I did, you'd have me abort the baby?! How could Nelson be yours?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her every word was like a heavy hammer banging on his heart, making him feel bursts of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Ouch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why does it hurt so much?'</p></div>
