        <h1>Chapter 695</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having not read such professional law books in nearly four years, Grace thought she would be rusty and might not even be able to remember the legal provisions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she seemed to remember them as easily as before. She was even like a sponge, looking at all sorts of case studies and absorbing the experience of her predecessors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was the brain's instinctive desire to fill in the gaps left by the last four years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace enjoyed the two thick law books.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the study next to Jason's desk, another desk had been set aside for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace read carefully, and if she had any doubts, she would habitually mark it in the book before using the internet to look up the relevant information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Absorbed in her book, Grace did not notice Jason who was sitting on the other side. He was looking at her with his deep eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never seen her as a lawyer, and he had not bothered to glance at her even when she was a prisoner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The first time he met her, she was wearing a fluorescent sanitation service worker uniform and looked awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had seen much of her since, but only now was he seeing her so absorbed in something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could almost imagine her at her desk when she was still a lawyer, absorbed in the cases she was working on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right, she said she liked her job as a lawyer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her rapt attention at the moment seemed to prove what she said to be true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if all she saw were the case studies, legal provisions&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes could not help being attracted to her. He only found her seemingly more beautiful at this moment. It was not like the usual serenity, but there was some persistence against the wind and snow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like a blooming plum blossom raising its head alone amid the strong snowstorm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Is this... The woman I love? No matter what kind of torture she has suffered, she still carries persistence in her heart and loves her career loves so much.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason only felt some kind of shock in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, he even wanted to hide her so that only he could look at her this way and no one else could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace was done reading the case study, she looked up only to find Jason staring at her. "What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just think you look very beautiful when you&rsquo;re absorbed in your reading," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face turned red immediately, and at that moment, her phone rang. Grace answered it and heard a soft female voice coming from the phone. "Is this Miss Cummins? We&rsquo;re XX Hospital. You&rsquo;ve made an appointment with Dr. Guzman earlier. Are you coming at the appointed time tomorrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurriedly replied, "Yes, I'll be there on time tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. Sorry for bothering you. Goodbye," the lady replied politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace put away her phone while Jason's voice rang in her ear. "What? Where are you going tomorrow?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly, looked up at him, and said, "I&rsquo;m going to the hospital. I haven't been sleeping well lately, so I want to consult a doctor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ultimately, she did not tell him the cause of her bad sleep was the series of dreams, lest he would think too much of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had amnesia and those dreams were of her meeting Brian when they were younger, then... That meant Brian had not mistaken her for someone else previously!</p></div>
