        <h1>Chapter 2344</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nothing to worry about... But why do I feel faintly uneasy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though his feelings for her had not recovered, he kept thinking about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What magic did that woman Kyla have that she could still have some influence on him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla got out of the bathroom in the evening, she saw Martin Weiss standing beside the bed. He was staring at the suitcase that she had almost finished packing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was startled. "W-Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mallory Malcom said you're returning to Emerald City," he said as he looked at her in a bathrobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she answered. His sudden appearance left her at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going back so soon? Are you going to stop begging me?" he said with a half-smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "You won't say yes even if I keep asking you, will you? Since nothing will come of it, I might as well go back and think of something else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How straightforward! You come and go as you please!" Martin Weiss snorted coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only spoke indifferently, "Mr. Weiss, I'll continue packing now. I wish to rest early. If there's nothing I can do for you, please leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she continued to fold the clothes that had not been folded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly took her arm and said coldly, "What if I have something you can do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, then. What do you want?" Her tone was distant and polite as if she was distancing herself from him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned. He did not like her using this distant tone with him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What solution can you think of when you go back to Emerald City? Believe it or not, if I say I want Jacqueline Bowman to stay in prison for the rest of her life, she&rsquo;ll have to stay there. No one can let her out!" he snarled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a bitter smile, she looked at him and said, "I believe you. If there's no way I can get Jacqueline Bowman out on probation, I&rsquo;ll just have to find another way to find Amber Mitchell!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea how she would do that, though.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What does Amber Mitchell mean to you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's someone I'll always hold dear in my heart and someone I want to see again. I want to find out if she's okay. I&rsquo;ll be filled with joy if she's okay, and I want to do everything I can to help her if she's not!" she said sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What about me? What am I to her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He almost asked those questions, but the words got stuck in his throat. Ultimately... he only said, "Kyla, never appear before me again if you really leave tMason Swansonty this time. Otherwise, it's not going to be easy for anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her breathing paused for a short while. His words made her feel as if she had been stabbed in the heart, and it could not help but bleed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so painful and hurt so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that a person's words could hurt so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was the one who put him in this position, was she not? Had it not been for her decision, he would not have chosen to forget his feelings with hypnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, perhaps what went around came around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She deserved all these!</p></div>
