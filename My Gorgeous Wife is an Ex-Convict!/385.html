        <h1>Chapter 384</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dark hair, moon-white skin, and a sleek neck. From her line of vision, she could see the shape of one of his ears and the profile of his face. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not take her eyes off of him. She even felt that his ears looked better than the average man's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he straightened up and turned to face her, she felt as if something had struck her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the moonlight, his eyes were like peach blossom petals that fell on the lake, causing silver ripples. His lips opened and closed. They acted like strings that stirred her heart up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, it was as if the sky and the earth had disappeared. She could only see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she watched as his face got closer and closer to her. His features were exquisite, like God's most elaborate masterpiece.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened?" Her ears finally heard his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shuddered. She came back to her senses only to discover that she had fallen into a trance just by looking at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... Nothing," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If there's nothing else, we can go back now. You can always come here when you want to see your mother. Even if your father finds out that your mother is buried here, he won&rsquo;t be able to take her ashes anywhere else," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held out his hand to her as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at the hand that was held out to her. She hesitated for a moment before placing it in his hand. "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the second time this evening that she had thanked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The first time was when he helped her find her mother's cinerary casket. This time, he helped her bury her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really want to thank me, you might as well like me more," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, and her face could not help turning red. Then, with her head down, she followed him out of the cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got into the car, and Grace looked out of the car window at the receding cemetery. The burden she had been holding in her heart was finally let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From now on, this would be her mother's final resting place. Besides, she would not have to worry that her father would move her grave again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were all thanks to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she kept saying that she wanted to keep her distance from him and avoid getting involved with him, she kept owing him favors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said he wanted her to like him more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How serious was his affection for her? Could she... really overcome the fear in her heart and the trauma he had given her during those three years in prison? Could she allow herself to like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but look at Jason who was sitting next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like that?" His beautiful, amorous eyes slightly tilted to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... Nothing," she stammered, her heartbeat once again racing beyond the control of her body under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Subconsciously, she wanted to turn away to avoid his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really all right?" He leaned forward. He grabbed her chin with his long fingers, forcing her to look at him. "You know what? You&rsquo;re looking at me as if you&rsquo;re conflicted. Why? What did I do to make you conflicted?"</p></div>
