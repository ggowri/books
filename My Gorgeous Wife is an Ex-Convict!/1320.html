        <h1>Chapter 1319</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No-Nothing..." she said with difficulty. It had only been a minute or two, but her face was white as a sheet, and she looked as if she was enduring great pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way she looked seemed to make his heart fill with panic. "I'll take you to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" She grabbed his arm so hard that it hurt badly. "I'm alright. It's old trouble. I'll be okay... I'll be okay in a minute. Do you agree... to my terms?" she asked with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. 'Old trouble? When did she get it? She never had something like this when we were together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or did she get it while she was in prison?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do... Do you... agree?" she asked again as if pressing for an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her with darkening eyes, and after a long while, he finally said, "Okay. Three months, right? Fine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a relieved smile on the corners of her lips. The sight of her smile on her pale and frail face made her look so beautiful and fragile. For a moment, Martin Weiss could not describe what he was feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn loosened her grip and stood up straight while shaking. "Then I... I'll hand over Nelson to you... in three months. Mr. Weiss, I hope you can treat Nelson well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She released her grip on his arm as she spoke and headed to the door of the suite with faltering steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn!" Martin Weiss could not help calling out to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her footsteps paused, and she turned around slowly. "Mr. Weiss, is... Is there anything else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you're alright?" he asked. Somehow, there was a strange uneasiness in his heart that made his heart beat very fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled faintly. "Why would I not be alright? I... was alright when I gave birth in prison... What could happen now? I'm fine, and I'll take good care of... myself..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she walked to the door, opened it with almost all her strength, and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door closed with a bang, and Martin Weiss seemed to snap back to his senses. He could not help laughing at himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's wrong with me? I can't believe I was worried about Kyla Corbyn for a moment there!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I need not worry about women like her! Three months. It's just three months. In three months, I'll have nothing to do with her after getting Nelson's custody!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But why is this fact prickling my heart? The pain makes it a little hard for me to breathe.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to see Kyla Corbyn the next morning. Nelson had already gone to the kindergarten and was not at home while Mrs. Corbyn went out grocery shopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Kyla Corbyn was at home.</p></div>
