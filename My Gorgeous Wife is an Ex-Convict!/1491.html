        <h1>Chapter 1490-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">I</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason narrowed his dark eyes and stared at Secretary Wang. "Is that so? You didn't know she escaped?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I didn&rsquo;t," Secretary Wang insisted and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay. You told my men that you wouldn't say anything until you saw me, so why don&rsquo;t you tell me right now what you wanted to say?&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Old Master Reed said if Grace found out the truth after his death but chose to stay with you, then he'd like to make a bet with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"A bet?" Jason was stunned for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang said, "Yes, a bet! Young Master, Old Master Reed wants to bet whether you're willing to give up your life for a woman just like your father previously did."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's expression sank immediately. "What does this mean?" After all, the old master was no longer around. Besides, how was he going to bet on such a thing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang tugged the corners of his lips, smiling without saying a word. However, it was a bit creepy when he showed such a smile on his battered and swollen face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Tell me, what do you mean?" Jason's voice was deep. His cold and indifferent gaze suddenly sharpened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang said, "Young Master, you'll find out when the time comes. Old Master Reed only hoped you could bear in mind your father's lesson&mdash;to die for a woman is to die for nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You have no right to say what will become of me!" Jason stepped forward and grabbed Secretary Wang's collar. "You'd better tell me what Old Master Reed told you to do, or you'll only suffer."</p></div>
