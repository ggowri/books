        <h1>Chapter 17-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the inspection from the Urban Management Bureau ended, Mia told Grace, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having a reunion with our high school classmates this weekend. Come and join us."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"A gathering?" Grace laughed. Given her current condition, she would be mocked if she were to go. No doubt, that was exactly what Mia intended. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so kind to think of me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But, no. I'm not free, and I won't be going.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh come on, Grace. These events are impossible to pull together. It&rsquo;s a rarity. What is it you're busy with? Come and join us!" Mia tried to persuade her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did Mia think that Grace was born yesterday?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This woman had been rude, spiteful, and petty. She could just imagine how a &lsquo;reunion&rsquo; would play out&mdash;with Mia, no doubt, telling everyone how Grace, former beauty and valedictorian, lost it all, went to jail, and was currently working in Sanitation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nope. Not happening.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I need to work over the weekend. Do you really think that weekends would be rest days for me given the scope of my job?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mia was speechless when she heard that. Indeed, she had forgotten.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"However..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm clearing the rubbish. Let's talk another time." Before Mia could finish her statement, Grace turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was not stupid. And, seriously, Mia was so obvious.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It&rsquo;s okay. You&rsquo;re okay.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tomorrow is a new day.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace repeated her mantra and pushed the negative thoughts from her mind. She couldn&rsquo;t control the mean or shallow people around her, but she could control herself. And she could choose to meet experience with positivity.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two days later, the Vice Director instructed her to send a document over to someone from the Urban Management Bureau, only problem was it was the weekend, and the Management Bureau representatives were at a country club luncheon.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ordinary sanitation workers were not allowed to enter such a place, and more than one employee at the prestigious club tried to intercept her as she entered the lobby.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace caught the odd stares of other wealthy people, their looks saying clearly, &lsquo;what is SHE doing in here!?&rsquo; Like she was some other species or something.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had been to this particular club many times before for dinners and charity events. Sean belonged to this particular country club.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">One of the staff nodded to her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re expecting you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sooner she could hand off this paperwork, the better.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then she could leave.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The staff member led her down one hallway and into another. Then he opened the door to a ballroom. Many people were inside.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace stepped in, she heard a familiar voice, saying, "Look who's here!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace saw Mia Jenkins, Maria, and some of her high school classmates.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;There you are, Grace!&rdquo; Mia called out loudly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace knew immediately that Mia had deliberately made this arrangement. As she was from the Urban Management Bureau, the supervisors would be eager to get on her good side. As long as Mia wanted a document and specified the person she wanted to bring it to her, the Vice Director would accede to her request.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"See! I didn't lie to you. The prettiest girl in our class has become a sanitation worker!" Maria said, looking snobbish.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's uniform completely stood out from the classy attire of the rest of the people in the private room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is this our beautiful super scholar? You were imprisoned for three years and I almost couldn't recognize you.&rdquo; Greg looked down his long nose at her. &ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s wrong, Sean didn&rsquo;t want to dote on you anymore after you killed his sister?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Between the mention of Sean, the horrible accident that ended Jennifer&rsquo;s life, and seeing this man in front of her, Grace froze.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The pain of so many memories slammed into her like a flood.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so high and mighty now, are you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace stepped back instinctively. Greg had been a rich and entitled jerk back then and he didn&rsquo;t appear to have matured at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She&rsquo;d been cornered by him at a charity auction when she&rsquo;d gone outside for a bit of fresh air. Greg grabbed her arm and assaulted her. If Sean hadn&rsquo;t come out to find her, she knew it would&rsquo;ve been worse.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean had taught him a lesson that day.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But there was no one here to protect her now.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg fingered a small scar near the corner of his eye. &ldquo;Your ex is untouchable&hellip; but you aren&rsquo;t. And I still owe you for what he did to me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mia and Maria&rsquo;s eyes were glittering like this was the greatest show they'd ever seen.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace ignored Greg. She walked a few feet over to Mia and handed the paperwork over to her, saying, "This is the document you asked for."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mia smiled. After taking the document, she said, &ldquo;Grace, sorry you had to make the trip.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sure, she was.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">From the way Mia grinned, this had been better than Christmas.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace turned around and was about to leave the room when Greg caught hold of her arm. "Why are you in such a hurry? This is our reunion. Let's catch up."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he took a glass of red wine and put it to Grace's lips. &rdquo;Come on, drink up. Back then, you were convicted of driving under the influence. Don't tell me that you can't drink!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace refused to open her mouth. She turned her head and pushed him away.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg lost his balance and spilled the red wine down his shirt. He became angry and gave Grace one tight slap in the face, shouting, "Ugh! Do you think you're still Sean's girlfriend? You're an ex-con and a sanitation worker. You don't know what's good for you!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Greg was shouting, he took up the bottle of red wine beside him and poured it over Grace's head.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The cold wine soaked her body, embarrassing her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What chilled her more were the looks her other classmates gave her. They shook their heads and cringed, but no one called Greg to stop. No one tried to help her escape.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maria laughed openly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mia smiled, saying, "Grace, apologize to Greg quickly. He may forgive you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Apologize?" Grace found the idea ridiculous. She was humiliated and assaulted, but she was expected to apologize to Greg. No. That wasn&rsquo;t happening.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She might be the butt of their jokes and she might have to deal with being looked down upon for the rest of her life, but she still had her dignity.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace pursed her lips. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg only became more infuriated. "Grace, do you think that you're still Sean's girlfriend? I'm giving you a chance to apologize to me. Even if I raped you right here, no one would stand up for you!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A bell sounded, signaling the meal, and Grace was horrified as the other guests filed out of the room, ignoring her plight entirely.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg grabbed Grace by the shirtfront and sent her flying. She hit the ground hard and her shirt tore open, revealing her skin.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No!" Grace screamed as he advanced on her.</p></div>
