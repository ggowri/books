        <h1>Chapter 1763</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you okay? Are you hurt?" Jason asked Grace with concern. He was most worried about her right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm fine, but Lily fed Mason some medicine that made him unconscious. Oh yes, where's Lily? We have to ask her for the cure!" Grace said in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason picked Grace up in his arms. "Let's go down the hill first. We've subdued Lily. We'll make her hand over Mason's antidote whether she likes it or not!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace breathed a sigh of relief at the sound of that. She rested her head against Jason's arms, and her tense body finally relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason held Grace and quickly headed to the foot of the hill while his men followed. They were protecting the unconscious Mason and Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Hart, do you want us to carry you?" asked several other bodyguards who were around Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No thanks. I can walk," said Brian as he began following them. The bodyguards did not say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian was walking with his eyes glued to Grace and Jason's backs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;One step too late again. I&rsquo;m always too late!&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knew that Jason would always be the man Grace loved no matter how hard he tried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had found Grace earlier, recognized her, believed in her, and not allowed himself to be blinded by jealousy, then perhaps she would not have married Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, he knew he was only comforting himself with these &lsquo;ifs&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Regardless... Grace was still willing to save him, so... it was worth it! He was not in love with the wrong person. Even if his love could not be reciprocated, he was willing to accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian's left hand gripped his right wrist, which she had held tightly before. His skin seemed to still feel the warmth of her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Like what Brian had said, there were indeed not many explosives planted as there were no further explosions on their way down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Cars were already waiting down the hill, and the police had arrived as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was about to bring Grace into the car when he saw that her face was extremely pale and her hands were twitching badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, what's going on? What happened to your hands?" Jason asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I..." Grace tried to endure it, not wanting him to worry too much. However, the pain in her hand was spreading in fits and starts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After hearing Jason's exclamation, Brian, who had been following them, rushed over and looked at Grace's trembling hands. He quickly said, "Do they hurt? Dr. Russell said you shouldn&rsquo;t be lifting heavy things. Your hands are almost crippled, and now they're... I wonder if Dr. Russell can cure&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Brian finished speaking, Jason's expression suddenly changed. "What did you say? Grace's hands are almost crippled?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Didn&rsquo;t you know?" Brian was shocked. He thought Jason would have known about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Tell me what's going on!" Jason snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said through clenched teeth, "I... I'm fine... Jay, don't worry. My hands are just suffering from some old problems..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian said apologetically, "I'm sorry, Grace! This wouldn't be happening to your hands if you hadn&rsquo;t tried to save me... I'm sorry. I'm sorry..."</p></div>
