        <h1>Chapter 3346</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler glanced at Veronica with indifference and said, "What's so difficult about it?" He thought it was a simple task that only a fool would struggle with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... but it's the first time I've seen a boy braid someone's hair," Veronica said. After all, she had never seen a boy like that around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's because you've met too few people," said Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was suddenly at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina finished combing her hair and went to play with Jasper. Mick walked over to Chandler and said, "Don't you find it troublesome to comb a girl's hair?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," said Chandler, his attitude towards Mick being somewhat different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, he had a discussion with Mick about viruses, but they couldn't convince each other, so they decided to take action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two people engaged in a virus attack and defense battle against each other, using viruses to attack each other's computers. However, in the end, there was no clear winner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler thinks that he actually has the advantage over Mick because he is two years older than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If both individuals are of the same age, there's a chance that he will lose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After that, Chandler and Mick became close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it not troublesome? Do you enjoy styling girls' hair?" asked Mick curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," Chandler replied. "But Tina is my future wife, so I wouldn't consider it a hassle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was speechless for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his age, he naturally understands what a wife is all about. He knows a little about Chandler and Tina's engagement, but he can't understand why Chandler decided to marry Tina when she was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marriage... isn't that something you're supposed to do when you're older?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That should be very far away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler never spoke about the reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Mason grabbed Veronica and asked her very seriously, "I can also braid your hair for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica paused for a moment, then responded, "No need, I'm not as young as Tina. I can braid my own hair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you like guys who can braid girls' hair, right?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not that I like him or anything, it's just that... um, he's quite rare. But I think a guy like him would actually be very gentle," muttered Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Chandler can be a bit sarcastic, it's clear that when he's styling Tina's hair, he's very gentle, as if he's afraid of hurting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can learn to style hair, and I can also become very gentle," Mason said. "So, sister, can you please not go and like someone else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hesitated for a moment as she looked at Mason and said, "Mason, you don't need to learn or change anything just because of something I said. I don't want you to make changes just for me." She didn't like the idea of Mason changing himself just because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because every time he made a change based on her casual remark, it always left her feeling heavy-hearted and gradually gave her a suffocating sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even now, sometimes she is afraid that her unintentional words might cause him to make some changes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why?" asked Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because... everyone is an independent individual, and should live well in this world for themselves. You should have things that you like, rather than liking what I like." She said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the age of 12, he/she is already a 6th grade elementary school student. In a few months, he/she will graduate from elementary school and move on to junior high school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she grew older, her perspective on many issues changed.</p></div>
