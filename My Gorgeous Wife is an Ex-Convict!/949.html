        <h1>Chapter 948</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Jason and Grace are back together... But why do I feel so uncomfortable at the thought of it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just now when Jason was holding Grace, he even felt jealous and had the impulse to tear them apart&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What came over you just now?" A voice rang in Brian's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked up. It was Patrick, a friend he had known since childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're here too," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I wanted to come over to say hello when I saw you and Jason together, but it didn't take long for me to realize that something wasn't right," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, he held back for a while, fearing that his presence would make things worse. He stood on the side, watching the situation as it unfolded. </p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was about to rush forward when Brian suddenly grabbed Grace's hand, fearing that the two men might fight. Luckily, nothing happened, so only now did he approach Brian. </p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You know how much Jason cares about Grace. He even looked like he was going to kill someone last time, so why would you meddle in this? Is there a woman you can't find in the entertainment industry?" said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many beautiful women in the entertainment industry wanted to get into the crown prince's pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's different." Brian took another sip of wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the difference?" asked Patrick. Speaking of which, he did not think Grace was stunningly beautiful. She just looked pleasant at most. However, both Jason and Brian had fallen for her, making Patrick confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian said nothing and only took another glass of red wine from a passing waiter before downing the contents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Yeah, what's the difference?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Grace isn't the little girl who saved my life and neither is she some stunning beauty, so why do I care about her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Is it because of that face?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'However, that's just a misunderstanding, isn't it? It's just because I always thought that the little girl would grow up to look like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'When in fact, the little girl grew up to be Stella!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian drank glass after glass as if he wanted to get himself drunk. Patrick could only drink with his friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A figure was now trembling in the corner of the banquet. He even lost interest in the new model he finally managed to hook up with. There was only fear in his heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Curtis Row never expected that the one who accompanied Jason to the banquet today was the paralegal called Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could hardly understand what was going on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought Grace was related to Stella, the woman often seen around Brian, so he had apologized by sending Grace some yellow roses for the previous incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, now it seemed that this woman... had more to do with Jason and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he saw Brian holding Grace's wrist and Jason stopping him, Curtis Row&rsquo;s back was immediately drenched with cold sweat as his hair stood on end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These two men were the most powerful and wealthy men in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Now... they're fighting over a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'For heaven's sake, who did I offend that day?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kaihao, what's the matter? You look so pale. Didn't you say you would introduce me to more e-commerce tycoons today?" the model said coquettishly.</p></div>
