        <h1>Chapter 3181</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One month later, Lisa also met with the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart and had a meal with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they met, Lisa felt uneasy and didn't know what to do with her hands and feet. She spoke very little. Fortunately, the old Mr. and Mrs. Hart were very welcoming and kept the atmosphere warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two families also discussed the future marriage of Valda and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The hotels have already been selected by me. You can choose from them later. The list of dowry will be given to you later. You can check if there is anything missing and let me know." said Mr. Hart, the elderly man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't really need to give a dowry..." Valda didn't finish her sentence before being interrupted by the old Mrs. Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, the dowry is still necessary. It's a sign of our Hart family's appreciation for you, Valda. It's also something that Brian's father and I have carefully prepared, so please accept it graciously," said Mrs. Hart with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda didn't say anything else after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa, who was sitting next to her, hesitated to speak but ultimately didn't say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing a meal, Brian accompanied Valda and Lisa back to their apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The caregiver helped Lisa change and wash up, while Valda went out to see Brian off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today my godmother seems quite nervous," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, she's afraid of saying something wrong and affecting our marriage," Valda said, understanding Lisa's concerns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It doesn't matter, even if she really says something wrong, my parents won't mind. They also know that she has been living in the village and hasn't had much exposure to the outside world. They can understand," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It can only come slowly. When she becomes familiar with city life and gets used to it, maybe it will be better. Right now, she rarely talks to anyone except the caregiver and the neighbors around the community," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some things just can't be rushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But fortunately, she can also see that Lisa is gradually adapting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they talked, they had already arrived at Brian's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you go back now," Valda smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you want to keep me?" he raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I would like to as well, but there's no extra room to stay in," joked Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You, don't you even ask me, how difficult it is to fall asleep without you by my side at night?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After we get married, I can be with you every night!" she said. "Hurry up and get in the car, drive safely on the road."</p></div>
