        <h1>Chapter 1712</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After the meal, Lina asked Anthony Sherman to accompany her to shop around the area to help with digestion as well as pick out gifts for Nelson, Mick, and Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At the same time, Lina told Anthony Sherman about Mason. "You don't know how many bruises there were on the child when he took off his clothes. I can't believe his family did such a thing. Even if he's adopted and not their biological child, they can't beat him up like that! The sight of it really pissed me off! If I had a child, I&rsquo;d worry about not loving them enough.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're going to be a great mother," said Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't know if I'll ever be a mother." Lina shrugged. After all, she was already 33 years old. A woman could only bear children up till a certain age. Although many women over 40 still had children, they were a minority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe she would get over Hadwin Stephenson after a few years, but she would no longer be able to conceive then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had always loved kids! She even thought that if she had a baby, they would look like...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What Hadwin Stephenson looked like when he was younger instantly recurred to her. He was so young and adorable. He was as delicate as a beautiful doll.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Gosh, what am I thinking?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina quickly shook her head, wanting to shake off the images of Hadwin Stephenson when he was a child from her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, a woman suddenly darted out from beside them and slapped Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was caught off guard. Before she could react, she felt her face burning. Anthony Sherman only reacted after hearing the slap. He instantly grabbed the woman, who continued to wave her hand about. He said, &ldquo;Who are you? Why are you slapping others?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let go of me!" The woman struggled as she stared maliciously at Lina. "Lina, how could you? Yes, I secretly took the photos, posted them on the company&rsquo;s forum, and sold the photos of you and Hadwin Stephenson entering and leaving the hotel to another party. But how... How would I know who they were? Someone contacted me and offered me a lot of money for the photos. I had no reason not to sell!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina froze when she heard that. She did not expect Holly Greer&mdash;her former colleague who was standing before her&mdash;to have anything to do with how the photos had spread from the company&rsquo;s forum to the internet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Holly Greer had often liked to trample over her and taunt her! However, after her incident with Hadwin Stephenson subsided, the design office fired Holly Greer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina had not seen Holly Greer for a few days. She did not expect to get slapped in the face as soon as she met her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You used Hadwin Stephenson's influence to have the design office fire me, and now I can't find a good job. Lina, do you even have a heart? How vicious..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Holly Greer continued swearing, and Lina's expression sank. She walked up to Holly Greer, raised her hand, and slapped her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a clear and loud slap. Holly Greer was dumbfounded by the slap, not expecting Lina to slap her at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How... How dare you slap me?" Holly Greer fumed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina sneered and said, "You slapped me just now. Why can't I slap you back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I slapped you because you went too far! I only sold a few photos of you yet you made my life miserable!" Holly Greer snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina retorted, "Do you have any proof that it's my fault the design office fired you and you can&rsquo;t get a job? But you just confessed what you did to me! Holly Greer, we were colleagues, yet you had to pick on me. What good did that do for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..."</p></div>
