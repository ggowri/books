        <h1>Chapter 453</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You Lei's eyes flickered with guilt as he said, "What do you mean by clean? I'm usually upright and honest. What is it that's not clean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I went to your parents' house yesterday to talk to them about you. They were both talking in Emerald City's dialect. Are they from Emerald City?" the mediator said casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, they used to live in Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You used to live in Emerald City too? Why did you settle in S City? Emerald City is better than S City," the mediator said as if they were having small talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Big cities have a lot of pressure. Although it's smaller here, it's a comfortable place to live."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's true." The mediator smiled and suddenly said, "I almost forgot. The man you wounded asked me to ask you about Miss Atkinson. He said that if you're not afraid of being exposed, you'd better pay the money as he requested, or he'll tell the world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You Lei's face turned pale, though he seemed to be trying hard to hide it. "Miss Atkinson... I don't know what he has to expose, but I was a witness in a case where the victim had the last name Atkinson. She was quite a famous socialite in Emerald City who died a tragic death. That's why you shouldn't drink and drive. If it hadn't been for a woman who drank and drove, Miss Atkinson wouldn't have been killed in the car accident."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As though unwilling to recall, You Lei shook his head. Then, he looked as if he was puzzled. "Why did the man I fought mention Miss Atkinson for no reason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know. Maybe you can ask him once you're out?" asked the mediator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They talked for a while longer, but he could not find anything useful from You Lei.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, the mediator went to the next room and said to Grace and the rest, "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's fine." Grace smiled a little. The outcome was exactly what she had expected. After all, it was just one meeting. How could it be so easy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... You Lei said he earned the money for the house by helping his friend with his business. If she could find out where the money for this house came from, could she find out who was the person who wanted to frame her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought to herself. After the mediator left, Hadwin, as if he had read Grace's mind, said, "I've checked the source of the money for this house. It was a guy who deposited five million into his account, and the guy was a friend of his, but we still need to check why he deposited five million to You Lei. After all, it has been three years, and his friend is now abroad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did he really help out his friend&rsquo;s business? So he got some bonus or reward from his friend? Did he need that much money, though? Besides, You Lei was only a regular employee back then. How much money could he make for his friends?" Lina sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We need to check this further," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I'll have it checked out," said Jason before looking down at Grace. He continued saying, "I'll have people look into it next. You don't have to worry. If you really want to clear your name, I'll clear your name for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could clear her name with the truth hidden as long as she could be satisfied and happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at Jason, a little dumbfounded. Did he really believe she was innocent and would find all the evidence for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, that's great! With Mr. Reed's help, Grace's case will definitely be reversed!" Lina exclaimed happily.</p></div>
