        <h1>Chapter 3755</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zack, can you explain to the people here that you only come to the school to pick up Veronica and bring her to me?" Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Zack found the situation strange, he truthfully replied, "Yes, every time I come to the school, I pick up Miss Barlow and bring her to you, Mr. Mason."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zack's words put an end to all the rumors and innuendos, and everyone present understood that the rumors about Veronica being kept by an older man would disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa couldn't accept this. How could this be happening?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the mocking, sympathetic, pitiful, and disdainful looks from the people around her, Vanessa couldn't help but turn to Veronica and say, "Veronica, what kind of unspeakable methods did you use? What is your relationship with this the Reed family Mason? Could it be that he's the one who's keeping you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of the department was almost going crazy, and the homeroom teacher next to her hurriedly said to Vanessa, "Vanessa, stop talking and apologize to Veronica and Reed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa was startled by the urgent tone of the homeroom teacher and came back to her senses, wondering what she had just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I was just curious about their relationship and why Mason needed to send a driver to pick up Veronica from school," Vanessa stuttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are...," Veronica was about to say "old acquaintances," but Mason interrupted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are boyfriend and girlfriend," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words were spoken, there was an uproar around them, and even Veronica herself was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does he... does he know what he's saying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica is my girlfriend," Mason said, and then he directly took Veronica's hand and walked towards the school gate. Zack quickly followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa collapsed to the ground with weak legs. She never expected such a "normal" answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, they're boyfriend and girlfriend, so naturally a driver would come to pick them up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why this obvious answer wasn't thought of was because the gap between the Reed family and Mason and Veronica was too big. Who would have thought that they were boyfriend and girlfriend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa's group of girlfriends were far away from Vanessa at the moment. Anyone could tell that after today's events, Vanessa was probably going to have a hard time in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica followed Mason to the school gate and got into Mason's car. Zack drove the car slowly away from the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you suddenly say we're boyfriend and girlfriend?" Veronica asked anxiously. "There were so many people just now, maybe someone even took a video with their phone. If it gets posted online..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not like it's something shameful. Even if it gets posted online, so what?" Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we're not really boyfriend and girlfriend!" Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said before, if our trial relationship goes smoothly, then we can officially date," Mason said. "Or do you not want to officially date me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica blinked her eyes. Officially date?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he saying that they could officially date now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or maybe you're just playing with me, and now you're tired of playing?" Mason said.</span></p></div>
