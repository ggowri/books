        <h1>Chapter 2883</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he did not love her, she still thought she was a better candidate than Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to her disappointment, the way Brian looked at her was still icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not interested in you. The Song family you're so proud of will no longer exist in Emerald City a year later. Perhaps the Song family can keep some things if you start planning now. Otherwise, you'll have nothing left."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Brian left the ward, leaving Phoebe Cross standing where she was in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Other than reluctance, resentment, and jealousy, there was more shock and fear on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does Brian intend to eradicate the Song family within a year? Is... Is he going that far for Valda Theller? He doesn't love Valda Theller, right? Why is he doing it? Why?' Unfortunately, no one could give her the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked out of the hospital and got into the car. He slowly closed his eyes as Phoebe Cross's last words flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It doesn't matter... even if I don't love her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda and Phoebe Cross were so different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda wanted him to love her, yet Phoebe Cross said it did not matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What can I do to make Valda stay with me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Head back to the mansion," he indifferently ordered the driver in the front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove toward the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian returned to the mansion, Valda Theller was drawing her storyboard draft on the coffee table in the living room with her legs bent sideways. It was uncomfortable to sit in this position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you drawing here? You can do it in the study," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can do it here. I have too many things, and I'm messy. It'll be troublesome if I go to your study and mess up something on your desk. I'll be more comfortable drawing here. At least I have nothing to worry about," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she had to stay here until the matter of her pregnancy was confirmed, she could only accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least she could live lavishly here, and Brian did not abuse her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Life still had to go on, so her work had to go on too. Fortunately, they lived in the age of theinternet. She could send her manuscripts online, so her job would not be affected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter if you mess it up. It doesn't matter even if you turn my study upside down," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was silent as she got up and said, "Brian, I hope you won't say anything that&rsquo;ll cause me to misunderstand from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He narrowed his eyes slightly. "What do you mean misunderstand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You might only be saying it casually, but it&rsquo;ll make me misunderstand that I'm important to you," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes stared at her. "What if I do care about you?"</p></div>
