        <h1>Chapter 3652</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even... if Jasper was able to get a sample of Roger's blood, it was probably calculated by Roger. Because he knew that the DNA from this sample would never match Lawrence's DNA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that was the case, then this person's scheming was too deep!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Jasper? If Roger really was Lawrence, how would Jasper treat him?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were too many uncertainties in William's mind at the moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper drove all the way to Stanford University, parked the car in a hurry, and ran to Roger's classroom. But there was no one in the classroom at the moment. It suddenly occurred to her that he didn't have class at this time today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had checked his schedule before and knew that he only had one class this morning. Was he back in his dorm? Or was he in the library? Or somewhere else on campus? He might even have left campus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper took out her phone and dialed Roger's number, but no one answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and began searching for him on campus. She searched every place she had encountered him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she arrived at the school's piano room, she saw him playing the piano through a glass window on a door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Roger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stared at the figure in the piano room, and her eyes suddenly turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this person be Lawrence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had doubted it before, but a DNA test had dispelled her doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after all this time, it seemed that he was Lawrence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper raised her hand and gently pushed open the door to the piano room, walking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was filled with beautiful piano music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, this kind of music felt like something Lawrence would play! Some people, even if their appearance changes, their name changes, and their behavior changes, this kind of music remains the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Lawrence?" she asked. Her clear voice sounded particularly distinct amidst the melodious piano music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The piano music suddenly stopped, and Roger's ten fingers lifted off the keys. He slowly turned around and looked at Jasper standing by the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you suddenly asking me this question again? Yes or no, don't you know?" he asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him, and there was a mole on his neck just like Lawrence's. His appearance was what she imagined Lawrence would look like when he grew up. And everything she heard from her father and William's conversation had already proven that he was Lawrence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are Lawrence!" This sentence was not a question, but a confirmation. Jasper said, "You knew that I wanted to take something from you to test your DNA, so you deliberately let me take the tissue with blood on it! Am I right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fixed on her, "Does the DNA test prove that I am Lawrence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The DNA test result is different because you had a bone marrow transplant, which caused a change in your DNA. Although this is rare, it is not impossible!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's eyes flickered, realizing that since the other party had found out about this, he could no longer hide his identity.</span></p></div>
