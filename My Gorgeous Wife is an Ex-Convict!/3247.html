        <h1>Chapter 3245</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, if you want to take a nap in my office next time, you can ask my secretary for a blanket to cover yourself. Otherwise, it's easy to catch a cold with the air conditioning on in the office," he added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh," she responded, glancing at the blanket covering her. It seemed that sometimes men could be more attentive than women, especially when it came to details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, you..." She suddenly spoke up as if she had just remembered something, but after saying three words, she hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What is it? Do you have something to say?" Martin asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla bit her lip and asked, "Why did you put that photo on your desk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she didn't specify which photo, he immediately understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because there was only one photo on his desk!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because I really like it, but also regret it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked puzzled. She understood why he liked it, but why regret it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you regret?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly turned the steering wheel and parked the car on the side of the road, turning to look at Kyla intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, there was silence in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Martin murmured, "I regret that I lost your smile."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla's heart suddenly shook, and her nose became sour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin raised his hand and gently stroked her face, "I'm sorry, Kyla. If I hadn't done those stupid things back then, you wouldn't have lost that smile so early. I ruined your life, but I also ruined my own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if that smile is gone, there will still be new ones," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But it's not carefree anymore," he said. Later, even when she smiled, there always seemed to be layers of pressure, exhaustion, and worries underneath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could smile gently, elegantly, and peacefully, but she would never smile carefree again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"People always grow up, and no one will always be carefree. Sometimes, the more experiences you have, the more you understand what to cherish," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Martin murmured, "the more experiences you have, the more you know what to cherish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he cherishes every day now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kyla, no matter what happens in the future, I won't leave you," he suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated for a moment, "You--"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So I hope you can be happier," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled slightly, "If you can really do what you say, then I will be happier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will definitely do what I say." As he finished speaking, his lips landed on hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could he bear to leave her? He couldn't bear it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the day of the wedding photo shoot, Kyla appeared in front of Martin in a white wedding dress with delicate makeup, and he felt a sense of confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if he saw her from years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, she had once said to him with a naive face that when they got married in the future, she would wear a beautiful white wedding dress and become the most beautiful bride.</p></div>
