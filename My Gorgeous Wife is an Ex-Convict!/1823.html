        <h1>Chapter 1821</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she knew she would regret it if she did not do this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The mansion was right in front of her. Lina parked her car at the side. She was about to get down when she suddenly saw another car passing by her car and stopping at the mansion's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The person who got out of the car was... Katherine Jackson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's pupils immediately shrank. 'What is Katherine Jackson doing here at a time like this? Hasn&rsquo;t she broken up with Hadwin Stephenson?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She only saw the security guards at the mansion&rsquo;s entrance respectfully stepping aside. One of them took the car keys Katherine Jackson handed over and helped her park her car, while the other opened the iron gate and let Katherine Jackson into the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson did not even say anything to the two security guards. It was apparent that she visited often, so there was a tacit understanding between both parties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked blankly at the scene before her. Her eyes were a little sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Almost in a daze, she got out of the car and walked toward the security guards, wondering why Katherine Jackson could enter the mansion and look as if she had done it many times before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is there still something going on between Hadwin Stephenson and Katherine Jackson?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the security guard who helped Katherine Jackson park her car came back. He could not help frowning after seeing Lina. He recognized her as the woman Mr. Stephenson had once brought to the mansion some time ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, the security guard rushed forward to stop Lina and said, "Oh, Mr. Stephenson isn't seeing anyone tonight. Mr. Stephenson has told us that he won&rsquo;t see anyone tonight, not even if something big has happened!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'He's not seeing anyone?' Lina's heart trembled. "Why could Katherine Jackson go in just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Miss Jackson? She's different. Mr. Stephenson has been waiting for Miss Jackson!" the security guard said with a smile and looked at Lina a little contemptuously. Compared to the luxury brands Katherine Jackson wore, Lina's clothes looked much cheaper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, Miss Jackson has been coming here a lot lately. Probably once or twice a week," the other security guard said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It probably won't be long before they get back together. After all, they dated for so many years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's right. Miss Jackson spends the night every time she comes. I think they may hold a press conference soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two security guards chatted casually, but their words were pouring into Lina's ears, making her body grow cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She comes once or twice a week, and each time, she spends the night in the mansion?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Hadwin Stephenson said he has never loved Katherine Jackson, but he&rsquo;s letting her stay in his mansion. What did he mean when he said he has something important to tell me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is he going to tell me that something&rsquo;s going on between him and Katherine Jackson?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Did he say he was going to marry me just because I'm pregnant? Or have I always just been a backup?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he had a falling out with the Jackson family before, he had given her his affection. However, he had now gotten back together with Katherine Jackson when he had some business dealings with the Jackson family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two security guards looked at Lina's pale and dazed appearance. One of them advised, "You should leave, and stop dreaming about things. There aren't many ordinary people who can join a rich family. Miss Jackson has always been the one Mr. Stephenson cares about the most. Otherwise, after Miss Jackson's scandal, how could he..."</p></div>
