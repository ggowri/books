        <h1>Chapter 2761</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, the little white dragon cured the girl's illness with all his power, but he also disappeared in the clear blue skies after exhausting all his power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director expressed the somewhat sad story humorously. The children could see the joy, but adults could see the sadness beneath the joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller only felt her eyes becoming welled up with tears as she watched. She sighed for the little white dragon, but all she could hear were the children's laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kids found it hilarious that the fake savior fooled the little white dragon into doing many ridiculous things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller glanced at Brian, who sat beside her and found him very focused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he could not hear the sounds around them and was completely focused on the movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he that focused&hellip; when watching movies?' Valda Theller thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's pupils shrank suddenly when she saw a tear flickering in Brian's eyes. Then, the tear slowly oozed out of his eyes and slid down his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Is... Is he crying?' Valda Theller was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although there were some parts of the animated film where she was touched and ready to cry, Brian was not the kind of person to be easily touched. Was the crown prince not said to be ruthless?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was now crying from watching an animated movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the lights in the theater hall were off, the light from the screen was enough to let Valda Theller see him crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know whether to pretend not to see it. After hesitating for a moment, she silently took a tissue from her bag and handed it to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed to finally realize himself crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He cried! It was because the story seemed to make him see how fragile Grace was in front of his car that day. She had begged him with a face full of agony, but he was carried away by jealousy when he loved her. He was indifferent to her and refused to help her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pushed her back into Jason's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was destined to lose Grace at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand and touched the tears on his face. After a long while, he took the tissue from Valda Theller and said with a bitter smile. "I've made a joke of myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Crying at movies doesn't make you a joke. I cry at movies all the time," Valda Theller whispered in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's thin lips pressed slightly, but he said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm not a joke?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But my life seems like a joke to me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian and Valda Theller walked out of the theater hall after the movie ended, Valda Theller saw Brian's red eyes and silence. His phoenix eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of gloom.</p></div>
