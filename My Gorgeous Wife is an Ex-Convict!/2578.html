        <h1>Chapter 2576</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the contrary, George Gregory attended court. However, disappointment flickered in his eyes when he did not see Amber Mitchell there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had thought he would have one more chance to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It now seemed to him that seeing her had become a luxury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was in Daley Moss's office when the lawyer told her the final result.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did it go?" Daley Moss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not bad. Better than expected," replied Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Congratulations! If you plan to regain control of Mitchell Group, you should be able to regain power over the whole company," said Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, this woman would have managed Mitchell Group long ago had it not been for the car accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'm going to sell my shares. After all that I've been through, I don't want to live a life of malicious competition," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss looked at Amber Mitchell with surprise. After all, it meant she had to give up some of her interests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The wealth represented by these interests would drive ordinary people crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, are you..." Daley Moss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to go to Emerald City where there&rsquo;s an archaeological research institute. I want to study there for some time and then work in this field in the future," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss had a twinkle in his eyes. 'Brother loved archaeology. Is Amber Mitchell planning to take up archaeology because of him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Won't you feel lonely that way?" Daley Moss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell smiled. "I'm not lonely." It was because Herman... would always be with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell would have to see George Gregory even though she did not want to if she wanted to regain the shares and sell them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Gregory family took over her shares and paid a pretty good price for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was not contentious about it. It was also beneficial for Gregory Corporation for the Gregory family to take over the shares, and it was convenient for her to sell the shares to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After signing the contract in person, the two parties made a deal. The Gregory family generously paid the money right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the fund transfer information on her phone, Amber Mitchell knew that the money was enough for several lifetimes even if she was not cautious with her spending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The press said she was the ultimate winner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Winner? There's no winner. If this sum of money could buy Herman's life, I would&rsquo;ve chosen Herman without hesitation!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Mitchell, your plane will take off in two hours. Do you want me to take you to the airport?" asked one of Amber Mitchell's lawyers who was in charge of handling her affairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, thank you," Amber Mitchell said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" George Gregory was shocked. He finally managed to see her on such an occasion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But... she's going to the airport?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does that mean?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're... going to the airport? Why are you going to the airport?" George Gregory asked as he hurriedly stepped forward to stop Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory, you&rsquo;re crossing the line," Amber Mitchell said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you going to the airport?" He was only obsessed with the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's none of your business," replied Amber Mitchell as she went around George Gregory to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" he asked again as he grabbed her arm with his left hand.</p></div>
