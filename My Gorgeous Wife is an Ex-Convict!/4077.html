        <h1>Chapter 4075</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was taken aback. "You know Chandler?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know of him. I just didn't expect him to choose a girl like you," Weldon sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A girl like me?" Tina repeated, offended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina frowned slightly. It seemed that in the eyes of this photographer, she was just a little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler probably thinks the same way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she has grown up now. She is a woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He chose me because he loves me so much!" Tina grinned, refusing to be defeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Tina went to the dressing room with the makeup artist, Weldon let out a mocking laugh. "Loves me so much? That girl really knows how to talk! She's still young and naive. People from Hunter's family don't love someone so much that they would die for them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To be more precise, people from Hunter's family are cold-blooded!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They are conservative and traditional, and Chandler is the one who will inherit all of Hunter's rules. Will such a person really love someone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps Chandler's choice of this little girl is for some purpose!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it because she is the only daughter of the White Maple Group's leader? Or is there something else about her that Chandler sees?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the Hunter family never makes a bad deal!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked at herself in the mirror. Today, she wore a slightly curly black long hair and a clean and elegant makeup. Her eyes were specially modified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wore a simple and elegant white sleeveless long dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she felt a little strange looking at herself like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Usually, she dressed casually, even if she attended some banquets, she would wear more luxurious and grand clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right now, it looks a bit like a beach vacation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if she were on a beach vacation, she would usually only wear sunscreen and go without makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Eugenia walked into the room and saw Tina like this, she exclaimed, "Tina, you look so beautiful, just like a model."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia wasn't wrong. Tina is 170cm tall, which is definitely tall enough to be a model!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina and Eugenia walked out of the dressing room and saw Kit standing not far away under the spotlight of the studio, with a makeup artist touching up his makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit was also wearing all white, a white shirt and white suit pants, with only the tie in a light blue color, which matched the sea blue gemstone ring on Tina's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Kit saw Tina approaching, he said to her, "Hello, I hope today's shoot goes smoothly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I hope so too," Tina smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Eugenia could hardly take her eyes off her friend and Kit. The couple's outfits were so matching when they stood together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh... of course, Tina and Chandler also looked good together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia silently added in her mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the shoot began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weldon requested that the two of them act like an ordinary couple, interact freely, and pose for him to capture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Tina casually chatted with Kit.</p></div>
