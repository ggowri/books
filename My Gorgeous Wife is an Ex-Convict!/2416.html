        <h1>Chapter 2414</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In business, it was natural for businessmen not to want to be in conflict with other corporations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If the Barlow family&rsquo;s business suffers any losses because of this in the future, the Reed family should be able to cover them. After all, our two families can also have some business deals. Reed group is working on a real estate project recently. If you're interested, you can join us," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow stared at Jason thoughtfully. Moments later, he smiled and said, "Okay, I'll start making arrangements. I should be able to give you the answer you want in a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was relieved to hear it. When she wanted to get her daughter to go back to the hotel, she found that her daughter had fallen asleep while leaning on William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kids fell asleep so quickly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stepped forward and bent over to pick up her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jasper Reed's two small hands were grabbing William's small arm and holding it tightly. It was impossible to pull them apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to wake her daughter up, but William said, "aunt Cummins, don't wake Jasper up, okay?" The little one's pleading eyes made Grace a little hesitant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt like she would upset the child if she woke her daughter up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you let Jasper sleep here tonight? The kids haven't seen each other for a long time. I heard they used to sleep together, so it should be alright," said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly, feeling as though someone was about to steal the precious treasure he had kept for so long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're older now. It's inappropriate for them to sleep together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're only six. They're not that old," said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two fathers looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the sleeping Jasper seemed to sense something and muttered, "I want to be with William... Fei..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace instantly felt a pang in her heart. She looked up at Philip Barlow and said, "Then... sorry for any trouble Jasper will cause you tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow smiled. "Don't mention it. I think William will love to spend more time with Jasper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not refute and just followed Grace's decision. He held their son's hand and said, "Alright, let's go back to the hotel first. We'll pick up your sister tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Mick Reed. Before he left, he looked at his sister, who was holding William's small arm and seemingly smiling in her sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed asked on their way back to the hotel, "Does one like someone forever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you ask?" Grace asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm wondering when Jasper will stop liking William. That way, she'll stop talking about coming to Deer City all the time," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace touched her son's head and said, "If you really like someone, you won't stop liking them. You&rsquo;ll always like them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it just like Mason and his sis?" Mick Reed still remembered his younger brother, who had said more than once that he would always like his sis!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. "Maybe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe?" Mick Reed had confusion in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "You're too young. You don't know how long your fondness will last, but I hope you'll learn to cherish this 'fondness' no matter what. Liking someone isn't easy, and it's even harder to keep liking them."</p></div>
