        <h1>Chapter 1887</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After seeing a doctor, it was confirmed William only had some skin trauma, and the wounds on his face would not leave scars. Hence, he was just given some ointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was afraid that the five-year-old might confuse the ointment with something else and swallow it, so she decided to put it away. She would apply it to the little one&rsquo;s wounds herself every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her daughter asked her for the ointment at night. "Mommy, I'll apply the ointment for William."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace raised her eyebrows slightly. "Do you know how to do it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes!" The little one nodded her head hard. "I'm not a child anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was somewhat funny that a five-year-old was saying that she was not a child. However, Grace also knew how reserved William was with her. Every time she approached the boy, she could feel the tension in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She pondered for a moment and handed the ointment to her daughter. "Then apply it for William. But remember that the ointment can only be applied externally, not eaten. Remember to wash your hands after applying the ointment!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay." Jasper nodded her little head and skipped to William's room with the ointment. Of course, it was also her room because she shared a bed with William at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper entered William's room. The room was well decorated and there were a lot of toys in the room. Of course, Jasper had moved these toys from her room, so they were dolls and toys for girls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William froze slightly when he saw Jasper come in. Then, he saw the ointment in her hand. He reached out to take it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jasper insisted on applying it for him herself. "We're best friends. We should help each other!" she said persuasively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His lashes quivered slightly. His mother had told him before that he and she would never be friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper uncapped the lid, squeezed out the ointment, and applied it to William's injured face. Then, she used her two hands to take off his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's little face blushed. "I... I'll do it myself." He was five years old but already had an idea of things regarding gender identities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You have injuries on your back too. You can't see them," she muttered. She went on to undress him and apply the ointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her little hands continued to apply the ointment. In her opinion, the more ointment she used, the sooner William would get better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why did you... help me with the fight?" William asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Didn't I tell you we're best friends? Of course, I'm going to help you when others bully you!" she replied matter-of-factly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you really think we can be best friends?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why not?" she asked in confusion.</p></div>
