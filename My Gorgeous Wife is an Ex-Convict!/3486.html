        <h1>Chapter 3484</h1>
        <div><p> </p><p>As he watched the kidnapper being choked to death, Lionel quickly said, &quot;Mason, my sister and Jasper have escaped. The others are looking for them. We must find them before those people do!&quot;</p><p>Mason suddenly snapped out of it and forcefully pressed his finger, causing the kidnapper&#x27;s neck to twist and become motionless.</p><p>Mason threw the person aside and quickly untied Lionel. &quot;Do you know where they escaped to?&quot;</p><p>Lionel shook his head and looked at the unconscious kidnapper on the ground with some fear. &quot;Is he...dead?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m not dead. The force wasn&#x27;t strong enough to kill me,&quot; said Mason. If he had really taken a life, Veronica wouldn&#x27;t be happy about it.</p><p>So he won&#x27;t take lives lightly.</p><p>However, if the person earlier had succeeded in harming Veronica, he would have definitely killed that person.</p><p>Even if there are lives at stake, it doesn&#x27;t matter!</p><p>Veronica and Jasper finally managed to escape.</p><p>Jasper said to Veronica, &quot;I ruined your necklace, but I&#x27;ll get you a prettier one as a replacement.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No need, we destroyed a necklace to escape, it was worth it,&quot; said Veronica. The necklace was a gift from Mason, and although the kidnappers had taken away their communication devices, they had not searched for the necklace.</p><p>Veronica&#x27;s hands and feet were temporarily untied by the kidnappers because they wanted to do something inappropriate to her. It was during this time that she opened the mechanism of the necklace pendant.</p><p>Because when Mason gave her this necklace, he mentioned that it had a mechanism. By opening the mechanism, the pendant would turn into a mini dagger, which could be used in case of emergency.</p><p>She initially just thought the necklace was well-designed and liked it, but she didn&#x27;t expect it to have such a function.</p><p>What surprised her even more was that one day, the necklace actually came in handy.</p><p>Although they managed to escape, they found themselves in a remote and desolate area with no signs of human presence around.</p><p>Although there is a road that is open to traffic, they are afraid of being discovered by kidnappers, so they naturally dare not walk towards the road. They can only walk towards the mountainous area, looking for a place where there are people, while also delaying time.</p><p>&quot;My father and the others will definitely find our whereabouts soon, it won&#x27;t take too long,&quot; Jasper said with trust in his family.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I didn&#x27;t expect him to do something like this.&quot; Veronica felt ashamed when she thought about Jasper&#x27;s family and her own family.</p><p>This kidnapping incident, even if she were stupid, she would know it&#x27;s related to her younger brother.</p><p>Even the person who was guarding them in the small room before said that Lionel was the one who planned this kidnapping!</p><p>&quot;Alright, let&#x27;s quickly find a safe place. Once the police investigate, we&#x27;ll know the truth,&quot; said Jasper.</p><p>The two continued to move forward cautiously.</p><p>The mountain path was already difficult to traverse. After an unknown amount of time, Jasper and Veronica were both almost exhausted. Suddenly, Jasper stepped on nothing and let out a scream as he slid down a nearby slope.</p><p>Fortunately, Veronica grabbed Jasper&#x27;s hand with one hand, which prevented her from falling.</p><p>The scream that Jasper just made and the sound of her slipping down would definitely alert the kidnappers if they were nearby.</p></div>
