        <h1>Chapter 2974</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And the reason is simply because the other person has more power than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you're unhappy?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just...feeling a bit powerless," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Although I don't want to admit it, many times it's true. That's why people want to become stronger, because the stronger you are, the better you can protect the people and things you want to protect, including dignity, freedom, and so on," said Brian. "This world is a survival of the fittest. If you don't want to be seen as weak, then you should constantly strive to become stronger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After pausing for a moment, he looked at her and said, "Valda, aren't you also gradually becoming stronger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Me?" She paused for a moment, "Am I becoming stronger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, becoming stronger," he said confidently. "If it were the old you, you probably wouldn't be chasing after someone to apologize today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That... that's because..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because you're my girlfriend? If she insulted you, it's like insulting me, right?" He seemed to have seen through everything and pointed it out directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda stared at Brian blankly and asked, "How can you figure out everything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's because your thoughts are written all over your face," Brian said, then gently embraced Valda. "You see, you're becoming stronger for me, and I'll become even stronger for you. Strong enough to shield you from the wind and rain, and to solve all your troubles!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda leaned against Brian's chest, and all the frustration she had been feeling just a moment ago disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meeting him and falling in love with him feels really good! That's what she was thinking at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's go meet your parents quickly, or else they'll have to wait for us for a long time," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two of them arrived at the private room, the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart were already there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a formal meeting over a meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was a bit reserved at first, but she relaxed as time went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing the meal, the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart gave Valda gifts as a token of their meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, upon seeing the gifts in front of her, Valda found it difficult to accept them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were just too valuable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The old Mr. Hart gave her a jade bracelet, which was said to be an antique. Even though Valda didn't know much about jade, she could tell that it was worth a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The old Mrs. Hart gave her a set of jewelry, with diamonds and yellow sapphires, which looked vintage and elegant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This... is too valuable, I cannot accept it," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They are giving this to you because they value you. If you don't accept it, it will put them in a difficult position," Brian said on the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda wanted to say something more, but Mrs. Hart interrupted her, saying, "Valda, this gift was given to you and we didn't take it back. Its value is not determined by its price, but by the intention behind it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Valda, this gift is a little something from me and your aunt. Please accept it and focus on your relationship with Brian. If he ever upsets you, don't hesitate to call me. I'll be there to support you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda finally accepted these two gifts as a token of meeting.</p></div>
