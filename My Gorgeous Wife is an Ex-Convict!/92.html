        <h1>Chapter 91</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason ended the call and said to Terrence, "For the rest of today's meeting, finish it up for me and give me the conference record minutes tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then what about you, Mr. Reed?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace suddenly woke up and asked me where I went. I'm going back now," Jason replied. "The general direction of the meeting has been set anyway. What's left are only some small details."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, he walked out of the room. A lot of the senior overseas executives who were sitting there started talking about what had happened as soon as they saw their boss leave.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence faced an onslaught of questions.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Secretary Klein, what's going on?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why did Mr. Reed leave?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who called him just now?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, I can tell from Mr. Reed's expression just now that he must be in love."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Romanticists from overseas usually told this kind of story. No one here would dare make such statements.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence could only smile awkwardly. "Okay, let's continue with the meeting." Love? He, too, had thought such things, but he would never give voice to them aloud. His boss was a private man, and very guarded with his feelings.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">For a while, Terrence was a little uncertain. Like the overseas execs, he also thought Jason&rsquo;s behavior was very unexpected. And they didn&rsquo;t know half of it. He was the only one who knew the true scope of the accommodations Mr. Reed was making for this young woman.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, if Mr. Reed really fell in love with Grace in the future, this news would probably shock the entire city!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the rental room, Grace looked at Jay, who had just walked in. She asked in confusion, "It's already late, where did you go just now? I didn't see you when I woke up, so I got worried." She thought that there had been an accident.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I couldn't fall asleep, so I went out for a walk," Jason said. He then directly picked up Grace, who had just left the bed, and carefully placed her back down on it. "Alright, sis, go back to sleep. I won't leave anymore."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you are going out for a walk next time when I'm sleeping, leave me a note," she said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay," he said with a chuckle. "By the way, I have something to do tomorrow night, so I have to go out."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is it related to your work?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Kind of," he replied, "but it's not that important. It won't be a problem if I don't go."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You don't have to do that. I have no problem staying at home by myself. Actually, I haven't hurt as much these past two days, and I can move around more easily."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He smirked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been a day, Grace. You aren&rsquo;t healed yet. You need to rest.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re overreacting. I&rsquo;m feeling better already. You don&rsquo;t have to keep carrying me around."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well, I'll be back early tomorrow," he said, all but dismissing her refusals.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next day, Jason prepared dinner for Grace before leaving. Before going out, he also told her not to wait for him and to go to bed if she got sleepy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leaving the rental apartment, he headed to the house next door. At this moment, Terrence was waiting inside.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tonight, Terrence had already prepared the clothes that he wanted to wear.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason changed into a suit and combed his hair back. The outlines of his facial features suddenly became a lot sharper, especially his ice-cold eyes, which were beautiful but extremely chilling.</p></div>
