        <h1>Chapter 3922</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If there was anyone by her side who could deal with the Schultz family, then Mick was undoubtedly one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If...if Mick could help her get justice for her mother...but then she secretly mocked herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who was she anyway?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had only met Mick three times in total. Would Mick really deal with the Schultz family for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A proud son of heaven like Mick would only see her as an ugly duckling in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After taking a shower, Nancy changed into the clothes prepared by Mick's servant and followed the servant to the villa's living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was sitting on the sofa, wearing a new outfit and holding a book on his lap. His slender fingers were flipping through the pages, his eyelids drooping, and his long black eyelashes cast a shallow shadow like a fan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick, like a painting, gave people endless imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Nancy approached, she hesitated and said, "Mr. Reed, thank you. I will wash this outfit and return it to you later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This outfit was expensive. Even though she didn't usually wear many luxury brands, Clarissa liked all kinds of luxury brands, so thanks to Clarissa, she knew quite a few of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the outfit she was wearing was a top luxury brand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't have to return it to me," Mick finally looked up at Nancy and said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then who else would wear this outfit after you return it to me?" Mick asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't want to go home tonight, you can stay here for the night. I'll have the guest room prepared," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at him in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are many rumors about the Reed family's young master, Mick, in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially Clarissa, who secretly admires Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she lived with the Schultz family, she heard a lot about Mick from Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They said that Mick was always uninterested in people outside of his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to his brother Mason, Mick seemed more gentle, but his "coldness" was inherent in his character.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He never showed mercy to strangers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could even treat people like toys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people know that when Mick was young and living with his father, he wanted a sister because he had no siblings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the Reed family adopted a girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That little girl was like Cinderella in Emerald City, and countless girls envied her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when Mick's real sister, Jasper, the girl adopted by the Reed family, appeared, she disappeared shortly after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one knows where that girl is now, but the only thing that can be confirmed is that she was abandoned by the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the true princess appeared, who would still need a fake princess?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa once said, "These rich people just treat poor people as toys for their own amusement, but some poor people can't see through it themselves!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Toys for amusement?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then what about Mother, who spent so many years with the Schultz family, but after her death, was disowned by them? Not a single person from the Schultz family attended her funeral, and they didn't even inquire about her death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was Mother also treated as a toy for amusement?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And what about Mick? What is he treating her as now?</p></div>
