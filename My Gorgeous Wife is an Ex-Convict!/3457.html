        <h1>Chapter 3455</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right," Mason said, "everything should be based on Veronica's wishes. If Veronica doesn't want to break up, then no one can make her break up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stared at Mason in a daze. Her little brother, who had always been protected by her, had now started to protect her and shield her from all the storms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fifteen minutes later, in another mediation room, the Barlow family apologized to the Cross family and warmly expressed that they would never interfere with the relationship between the two children in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the Cross family learned that the handsome young man who had just appeared was the second son of the famous Reed family in Emerald City, their faces were filled with uncontrollable surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family, a wealthy and influential family that they could only look up to, now had their second son appearing in front of them, almost unreal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, let's end this matter here," Mason said, the youngest person present, but he seemed to be in charge of the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, then...let's just leave it at that," the old Mr. Cross said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, yes, let's just leave it at that!" the Barlow family also quickly agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And so, the mediation ended just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the police station, Mason was about to get into his car when Archer urgently said, "Hey, Mason, why don't you come back with us? It's not the same if you don't go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not go home?" Mason's eyes flickered. "The Reed family is my home. I live there every day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer's face suddenly became awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stepped forward and said, "Mason, thank you so much for today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason raised his hand and gently touched Veronica's swollen eyes. "I don't like seeing Veronica cry, so please don't cry anymore in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Veronica replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason got into his car and drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow family then got into another car, and Veronica could only wave goodbye to Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the Cross couple looked serious. When they were in the car, the old Mr. Cross asked his son, "What's the relationship between the Barlow family and the Reed family? Why did Mason from the Reed family call your girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel then told his parents what he knew about Mason and the Barlow family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After listening, the old Mr. Cross appeared to be deep in thought. "Anyway, you should continue to date your girlfriend and not offend her. After all, the Barlow family and the Reed family have a relationship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad!" Daniel frowned and said, "I like Veronica, and it has nothing to do with her family or the Reed family. When you say that, it seems like I'm only dating Veronica because of the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, since Mr. Mason from the Reed family has a good relationship with your girlfriend, you should also try to interact with him more often and build a good relationship. If you can establish a connection with the Reed family, do you know how many years of struggle you can save in the future? This is what old Mr. Cross continued to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad!" Daniel said discontentedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, just listen to your dad. Your dad wants what's best for your future," said Mrs. Cross, the elderly woman standing nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel saw his parents united and didn't say anything anymore. At this point, there was no point in saying anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Mason's performance today was quite unexpected. He didn't expect Mason to agree with him and Veronica not breaking up.</p></div>
