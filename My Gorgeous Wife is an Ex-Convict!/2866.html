        <h1>Chapter 2864</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it!" said Valda Theller. She would like to meet Brian no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her mood now differed from the night she went to his mansion to see him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the hospital, Kyla put away her phone and looked at Brian who was still anxiously waiting outside the operating room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she and Jason sent Grace to the hospital, they did not expect Brian to get news about it and arrive at the hospital not long after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had to undergo a C-section because her water broke early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were too many risks to giving birth to the baby, and it was unclear whether Grace could keep her uterus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was uneasy as she thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were standing outside the operating room, hoping that the doctor would come out and give them some good news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was quiet outside the operating room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason and Brian stared closely at the operating room. There were obvious concern, anxiety, and unease on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the two men who ruled Emerald City were currently waiting so anxiously for a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Kyla had a heavy feeling in her heart when she thought of Valda Theller's call earlier. How would Valda feel if she knew Brian was standing outside Grace's operating room now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No girlfriend would want her boyfriend to care so much about a woman he once loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What about Brian? Does he love Valda?' She would have thought Brian was still in love with Grace if she had not known he already had Valda as his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The light above the operating room door finally dimmed. The door opened, and the doctor walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason and Brian ran to the doctor at about the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How&rsquo;s my wife?" Jason asked. Grace mattered the most to him at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Both mother and daughter are safe. Although Mrs. Reed can keep her uterus, she suffered massive bleeding during the operation. The heavy uterus damage may require long-term treatment in the future. The specific situation depends on the patient's recovery after surgery. She might require further resection if we have no other choice," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason breathed a sigh of relief. It was good news. He would try to provide her with the best treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A nurse carried out a small baby girl and held her in front of Jason to look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the baby in front of him. Vernix still covered her red body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This is the baby Grace tried so hard to give birth to...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took the baby from the nurse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, is this what you wanted? You put Grace in danger for a baby. You put her life on the line. She might even have to go to the operating table again!" Brian's voice rang out suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sight of the baby girl stung his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked up at him. "Brian, this is my and Grace's decision. Who are you to say that to me?"</p></div>
