        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div><p>&quot;The management has passed down instructions that we&#x27;re not to approve any write-up about Grace Cummins,&quot; the editor replied.</p><p>Brian asked in amazement, &quot;Is the Stevens or Atkinson family behind this?&quot; It didn&#x27;t make any sense to him. When he had written about Lily earlier on, the editor had approved his news. However, he was not allowed to write anything about Grace!</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s not them. That&#x27;s enough, don&#x27;t ask any more questions. In any case, if this piece of news gets released, not only will you lose your job as a reporter, but I will be sacked as well!” the editor said.</p><p>Brian rubbed his eyes. To say he was shocked was an understatement. What the editor had said... seemed too much of an exaggeration.</p><p>&quot;Grace... is merely a sanitation worker. Who would want to protect her?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;re too young. In this world, there are many things beyond your imagination,&quot; the editor replied with a sigh. He was also puzzled about why Mr. Reed was out to protect Grace.</p><p>***</p><p>Meanwhile, as Jason watched Grace putting away the utensils, he said, &quot;I heard that the woman who told you to search for her ring has gone to the Sanitation Service Center to offer her apologies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Grace replied, &quot;but I have given her gift to Claire.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Did you see Sean? I saw from the news that he showed up with his fiancee, Lily.” As he talked, he watched Grace carefully for her reaction.</p><p>&quot;Yes, I saw him,&quot; Grace replied. She looked calm, as though she was talking about someone who was of no concern to her.</p><p>Jason crossed the room toward her. “How do you feel? Did seeing Sean again make you sad?”</p><p>When Grace heard the question, she lifted her head to look at him. “I think I know what you’re getting at.” She smiled softly. &quot;Jay, are you worried about me? Don&#x27;t worry. Please. I promise you, I would not grieve over such a man.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Worried?&quot; Jason&#x27;s gaze deepened. Other than being worried about her, there was something else...</p><p>Grace lifted her hand to stroke his head. Recently, she had been doing this more frequently. It was a tender gesture, and he’d be lying if he didn’t say that he liked the feel of her hands on him. Even if it was a touch so innocent as tucking his hair back.</p><p>“Jay, Sean is nothing to me. I will not be sad over someone who doesn&#x27;t love me. If I were sad, it would mean I still loved him.&quot;</p><p>Jason searched her eyes for any tell that she was just saying what he wanted to hear.</p><p>“Truly,” she said. “I’m glad I no longer feel anything at all when I saw him. And I’m even more glad that I didn’t marry Sean back then.”</p><p>“Oh? Wouldn’t your life have been much easier if he’d supported you? You might be married to him right now and not have to work a day.”</p><p>“That’s not a benchmark for happiness,” she said. “And I don’t mind work. What I meant was,” Grace said, “if my emotions could fade, then they were not that strong to begin with.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Her statement rang true to him. And hearing her assert that her emotions had not been strong for Sean, filled him with a sense of relief.</p><p>“The accident and everything that transpired…it revealed Sean’s true nature. And for that, I am grateful. It was a blessing to know that he was not the man for me.”</p><p>Jason reflected on her words for a moment. Conflict, hardships, loss…they were what defined us. Grace had been dealt a terrible hand, but she’d risen above it. Maybe not financially, as she was strapped to a low-income job and living in a low-income apartment, but she was determined to be positive. And happy.</p><p>That was more than he could say for most of the people who ran in his circles.</p><p>They had money and opportunity. Most of them squandered it with selfish decisions or idiocy.</p><p>Still, something of what she’d said had him wondering… “Sister, will you feel sad for me one day?&quot;</p><p>It wasn’t fair he realized, but he couldn’t help it. He wanted to possess her attention—even her negative emotions.</p><p>Grace was shocked by the question and she was at a loss for words.</p><p>&quot;Will you?&quot; he asked as he bent down, moving closer to her.</p><p>As he crowded her, he watched her pupils dilate and the way her pulse skittered at the base of her neck. She sucked a tiny breath.</p><p>When her gaze fixed on his, he could see her attraction—and her uncertainty.</p><p>&quot;I... what I meant earlier was, if I loved a person, I would be sad. However, Jay, you&#x27;re my brother...&quot; Grace replied, her mouth dry.</p><p>&quot;Can&#x27;t you love your brother?&quot; Jason asked. “We are, after all, family…”</p><p>He used his knuckles to lift up her chin, and he angled closer to her so she’d have no doubt of his intentions…</p></div>
