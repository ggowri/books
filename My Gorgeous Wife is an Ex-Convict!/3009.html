        <h1>Chapter 3007</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening at the villa, Valda watched Brian walk out of the bathroom and took the initiative to approach him, saying, "Let me help you dry your hair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," he replied, handing her the towel and slightly bending down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She helped him dry his hair little by little, then gently brushed aside his bangs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, his black phoenix eyes came into her view, and at the same time, her appearance was also reflected in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fingers lightly touched his eyes, and Mr. Yeats said that the way he looked at her was the gaze of someone in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Does he really love her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she knew was that his gaze towards her was very gentle and focused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong?" Brian asked. "Do you have something to tell me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda pursed her lips for a moment before finally asking, "Brian, do you...have feelings for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's body stiffened, his eyelashes trembling as he looked at her phoenix eyes, and a certain avoidance began to appear because he didn't know how to answer her question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Silence... spreading in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And Valda's heart sinking bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His silence was enough to tell her what his answer was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew it was almost impossible for him to give up so much love and fall in love with her in such a short time. But after hearing Mr. Yeats' words, she couldn't help but hope that he really did fall in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, she was disappointed once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing the disappointment in her eyes, Brian's heart felt a sudden pang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda..." he spoke with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly pretended to be casual and said, "You... don't have to say anything, I understand. Just forget that I asked anything, I was just asking casually."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled deliberately to show that she didn't care about his silence or his unanswered question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But the more she acted like this, the more painful it was for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I... I don't mean to not answer you, I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I, I know, I really know." Valda's voice became more urgent, and the forced smile on her face became even more apparent. "Brian, you really don't need to explain anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, let's just forget about this, okay..." Valda's voice had a hint of nasal tone. "Don't say anything more, because... because if you keep going, I'm afraid I won't be able to talk to you with a smile like this anymore..."</p></div>
