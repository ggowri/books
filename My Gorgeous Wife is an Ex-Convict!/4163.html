        <h1>Chapter 4161 Caught in the Act</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler was startled and looked at Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her face had turned a deep shade of red, and her once spirited and beautiful eyes now seemed filled with a misty glow, giving off an enchanting look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina!" Chandler quickly held Tina's face, checking her condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There was something off about her appearance, causing a sense of unease to flash through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'll have the doctor come and have a look at you," he said. The Hunter family had a family doctor who could be called immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just as Chandler was about to get up, Tina grabbed his hand instead. Her burning cheeks kept rubbing against his palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Chandler, I'm so hot... Can you hold me... please?" Tina whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's heart skipped a beat as he looked at Tina's current state and glanced at the unfinished snacks. Suddenly, a possibility crossed his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Immediately, he felt a surge of heat in his lower abdomen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Dammit, could it be that there's something wrong with these snacks!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Could it be that his mother had drugged them?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Chandler..." Tina's condition seemed to be worsening, and she was practically clinging to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This felt like a test to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, try to stay conscious, don't let the drugs control you, I... I'll go find the doctor." Chandler struggled to suppress his desires, wanting to take out his phone and call the family doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she exerted force and pinned him down, and at the same time, his phone fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina!" Chandler said hesitantly, feeling her body pressed against him, constantly challenging his self-control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I want you, Chandler... Please don't push me away..." As Tina's words fell, she forcefully pressed her lips against his, sucking on them passionately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> His body grew hotter and hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her hands continued to caress his body, and finally, under her repeated "passion," his rationality completely snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> --------------</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was awakened by voices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Mom, was it you who gave me the medicine yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What are you talking about? I don't understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If you really didn't understand, you wouldn't be here now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You two aren't married yet, but this happened. Don't you think you owe an explanation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Who... Who is speaking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina thought drowsily, one voice was Chandler's, and the other voice seemed somewhat familiar!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She sleepily opened her eyes and saw Chandler's handsome profile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hmm... Chandler looks so good-looking no matter when I see him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It's like a feast for the eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Miss Stephenson, you finally woke up." Suddenly, a voice sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was startled and turned her head to see Adele standing at the foot of the bed, looking at them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Aunt... Good morning... um." Tina awkwardly pulled the blanket, feeling quite uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, she was currently under the blanket and not wearing anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After what happened last night with her son, she was caught red-handed by the guy's mother early in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even if Tina had thick skin, she couldn't stand being looked at by Chandler's mother like this and continue to act nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Miss Stephenson, now that you're awake, please explain yourself to me."</p></div>
