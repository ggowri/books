        <h1>Chapter 3989</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick walked out of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing a bathrobe, his hair wet, and when he saw Nancy about to change clothes, his eyes darkened. He walked straight up to her and said, "Wait a minute, take the pill before you leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pill?" She was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Birth control pill," he said, "I didn't use protection yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy lowered her head. Yes, they had done it so many times yesterday without protection, so it was natural that she could get pregnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was perfectly normal for him to ask her to take the pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can go to the drugstore and buy it myself," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I'll have someone buy it and you can eat it in front of me," he said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she felt her nose tingling. Was he afraid that she would avoid taking the medicine? Was he afraid that if she really got pregnant, they would be entangled again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, she wouldn't calculate anything against him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't even consider using this possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," she lowered her head and responded softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, someone delivered the medicine after Nancy got dressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy swallowed the medicine in front of Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's it," she murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, from now on, we have no relationship. Whether you live or die in the future, it has nothing to do with me. Between us, it was just a transaction. You used your body to get </span><span>justice for your mother," he said with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes became sore, as if something was about to come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her use...had turned into a transaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between her and him, it was ultimately "no relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he was already kind enough not to make her cut off a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand. From now on, Mr. Reed and I are strangers," Nancy said softly, turning and walking towards the villa's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick just sat on the sofa, and the box of birth control pills, of which she only took one, lay quietly on the coffee table, as if witnessing everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, the matter between Nancy and me has come to a complete end. So from now on, the Reed family doesn't need to take any action against her," Mick said to his father in the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure it's really over?" Jason calmly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Mick replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the way you barged into my office yesterday didn't seem like it was over. If it really was over, then even if Nancy's dagger was pointed at her own heart, you should have been indifferent," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's face changed, "So, Father, that day you just wanted to test whether I could be indifferent to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had rushed into his father's office in a moment of desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But upon reflection, he realized that there were some clues. The situation at the time was not a coincidence, but a deliberate arrangement by his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father arranged for him to see the scene where Nancy was about to cut off her finger, and then see how he would react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're not willing to be honest with me, then I have to test you," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick stared at his father, their similar peach blossom eyes locked in a gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I hadn't barged in that day, would you really have let Nancy cut off a finger?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you no longer care about her, it doesn't matter how many fingers she loses. Just one finger is actually doing her a favor," Jason said indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For people who were not within their sphere of concern, the Reed family was usually cold-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Mother knew what Father did, what would she think?" Mick asked bluntly.</span></p></div>
