        <h1>Chapter 2012</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said lazily, "I think you can save the apology. Since you just said that your child can't be in the same class as Nelson, you should transfer to another school. That way, you don't have to stay in the same class."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The couple and their child were dumbfounded. They had never thought of transferring. They had been making donations to the school every year. Their donations would have gone to waste if they transferred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the principal looked at Grace and suddenly froze. "Mrs. Reed, what... What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, I'm the child's godmother. My godson is in trouble. Of course, I have to come and see what's going on," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The principal was stunned when he heard that. "Is this child... Is this child your and Young master Reed's godson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, my husband adores the child too," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The couple was shocked when they heard the words &lsquo;Young master Reed&rsquo;. In Emerald City, only one man was referred to as &lsquo;Young master Reed&rsquo;. Besides, the principal looked so respectful, so they were probably referring to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The couple looked at each other with bitterness in their mouths at the thought of the name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If they had known that the child had Hadwin Stephenson, the president of Stephenson Group, and Young master Reed of the Reed family as their backer, they would have let their son suck up to him. They would have gotten on the Stephenson and the Reed families&rsquo; good side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... they had now made themselves their enemy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The class teacher beside them seemed to realize who &lsquo;Young master Reed&rsquo; might be. Their face instantly turned pale, and they could not help trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What... What have I done?' The class teacher just wanted to slap themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The fiasco ended just like that. Grace and the rest left the school. She took Kyla and Nelson Corbyn to the hospital to order Nelson Corbyn a new hearing aid, while Lina went home with Hadwin Stephenson first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina seemed worried on their way home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Are you still thinking about Nelson's incident?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "Yeah. I didn't expect some children to be so... mean. Although Nelson has a problem with his hearing, he's as normal as other kids once he puts on his hearing aid. He has no problem communicating. Nelson is even much smarter than ordinary children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "There are always people who look at others&rsquo; flaws differently. Ignore them. Their transfer will serve as a warning to others, and no one will discriminate against Nelson anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There are still a lot of people who look at Nelson differently even though Nelson is better than average," said Lina as she lifted her hand and touched her bulging belly. "I... I don't know if our baby will be perfectly healthy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, even after careful prenatal examination, there were some problems that could not be detected. They would not know if the baby was perfectly healthy until they were born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Our baby will be alright," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "Even if there's a problem, I&rsquo;ll make sure our child is safe." He was confident.</p></div>
