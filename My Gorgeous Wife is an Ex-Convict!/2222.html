        <h1>Chapter 2220</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Treasure? Gosh, what am I thinking?' Jacqueline Bowman sneered to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Martin Weiss cared about Kyla, he would not have let Kyla spend her life in a small store, especially when she was pregnant now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some time, Mr. Lambert finally finished the bottle of wine. Martin Weiss turned to look at Kyla. "Let me send you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Kyla. She knew Martin Weiss did that to intimidate others and hint at them to stop having funny ideas with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Mr. Lambert&rsquo;s miserable state, she had no sympathy for him. After all, Mr. Lambert would probably have hurt her if she had not called Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the way Mr. Lambert looked right now could serve as a warning to Jacqueline Bowman as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Jacqueline Bowman had helped her out in the past, she did not like being used like that. Jacqueline Bowman's actions today had made Kyla upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Kyla and Martin Weiss were about to leave, the unkempt Mr. Lambert rushed toward Kyla in anger. In Mr. Lambert's opinion, everything today happened because of that b*tch Kyla. She embarrassed him in public, so there was no way he would spare Kyla!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before his hands could touch Kyla, Martin Weiss had already knocked him to the ground. Then, Martin Weiss's bodyguards came over and immediately subdued Mr. Lambert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Teach him a lesson about who he should and should not touch," Martin Weiss ordered his bodyguards before leaving the private room with Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other people in the private room paled as they looked at Mr. Lambert, who was pressed onto the ground like a dog. Even Neal Reid's hands that were at his sides were trembling faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They thought they could make friends with Martin Weiss through this meal today. However, they had become his enemies instead of friends!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only did they make enemies with Martin Weiss, but Mr. Lambert might also take out his anger on them. Neal Reid only thought he had offended both parties in this meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only person he could vent his anger on was Jacqueline Bowman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Martin Weiss's bodyguards &lsquo;taught&rsquo; Mr. Lambert a lesson and left, Neal Reid slapped Jacqueline Bowman, sending her staggering and almost crashing into the wall nearby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's face was burning, but she dared not speak. She only felt terribly aggrieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She previously helped Kyla when they were in prison! However, Kyla repaid her in such a way! How ungrateful. She could not accept it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Kyla and Martin Weiss had reached the restaurant&rsquo;s entrance. Martin Weiss said, "You haven't eaten anything yet, have you? Why don't we find a place nearby and grab something to eat? I'll send you home later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he seemed to recall something and added, "I can have the driver take you home. I won't get in, and..."</p></div>
