        <h1>Chapter 1936</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly quivered and opened his lips almost subconsciously. Her faintly salty tears filled his mouth instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the tip of Lina's tongue got into Hadwin Stephenson's mouth, deepening the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was caught off guard. Her deep kiss seemed to break down all the defenses he had set up, and she seemed to be tugging all his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could not help but slowly close his eyes even though the blood curse no longer caused him pain whenever she kissed or hugged him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if they had gone back to the beginning when there was nothing but sweetness between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">No pain and no betrayal. She was his everything, and he was the love of her life...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the kiss ended, Hadwin Stephenson heard Lina say with a slight gasp, "Hadwin, you still have feelings for me, don't you? You still love me, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson seemed to have just woken up from a dream. He instantly opened his eyes, grabbed her two arms, and pulled them away from his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Does a kiss mean I have feelings for you? Does that mean I have feelings for someone else if I kiss them?" Hadwin Stephenson tried hard to control his heartbeat that was speeding at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Only he knew that he was lying at this moment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she had kissed him a moment longer, perhaps he would have lost all control! She could still easily stir up his desire for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina paled. Her hands clung to the broad hem of her dress while she bit her lip tightly. Those Bambi-like round eyes of hers were full of tears as she looked at him pitifully in a fluster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson used all his might to look away and said indifferently, "Alright, I'm tired. I don't want to deal with you anymore. It doesn't matter whether what happened was a misunderstanding or anything else. Don't appear in front of me anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he left and went upstairs almost in frustration, leaving Lina standing in the living room alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina touched her face that was covered with tears, looked up at Hadwin Stephenson's departing figure, and suddenly shouted, "Hadwin Stephenson, I won't give up. Since you used to pursue me, now it's my turn to pursue you! You wouldn't have let me kiss you for so long if you didn't have feelings for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stopped but did not turn back or say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once his figure disappeared from her sight, Lina looked down at her belly and whispered, "Baby, why don't we pursue your daddy together? We'll tell him not to leave us. I hurt him so badly in the past. But as long as your daddy still loves me, I won't give up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she learned that he really had no feelings for her one day, then she would take care of herself and not cause him any trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps by then, taking care of herself and withdrawing from his world was the best thing she could do for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina turned around and walked toward the door. In the bedroom on the second floor, Hadwin Stephenson leaned against the door almost in frustration with one hand firmly pressing against his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Stop... Stop beating so fast!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His heart was pounding like it was about to jump out of his throat! </p></div>
