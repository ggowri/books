        <h1>Chapter 486</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt her face heating up when she thought about what happened last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she was awake right now, she continued to keep her eyes closed. She was afraid that she would see Jason when she opened her eyes and feel extremely awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Furthermore, what should she say the first thing when she sees him to avert the awkwardness?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace began to ponder these questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could figure out a plan, a voice was heard. &ldquo;Are you awake? If you are, there&rsquo;s no need to keep your eyes closed. Or perhaps, you&rsquo;re afraid to see me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s body shuddered as she abruptly opened her eyes. The first thing that she saw was an extraordinarily handsome face... Jason&rsquo;s face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, his hand was resting on the side of the bed. His waist was bent forward, and his face was just inches away from hers as his warm breath blew on her skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that distance, she could even count the number of eyelashes he had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those long and black eyelashes that complimented his eyes were the object of envy for women... Her eyes met his gaze, and she could not help from thinking about what happened last night. How his eyes were filled with seduction that called out to her, filled with the desire of wanting to have her whole...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; his voice abruptly sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s face turned a shade of red as she immediately said, &ldquo;No... Nothing...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he inched closer to her, and his fingers gently caressed the corner of her lips. &ldquo;Are you thinking about what happened last night?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bam!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt all her blood gush toward her face. She warmed up so much that she felt like she was going to burn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was not about to give up just yet. &ldquo;Did you enjoy last night?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was embarrassed to the core. &lsquo;How... am I supposed to answer such a question! This question is extremely embarrassing, okay!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if he noticed that she was embarrassed, he smiled and said, &ldquo;Sis, are you shy to answer this?&rdquo; His lips approached her ears as he said it. Then, he whispered, &ldquo;But I enjoyed it very much! I enjoyed how we were together last night as if we were the only one for each other.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice continued to ring in her ears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours and you&rsquo;re mine, is that right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed like she was hypnotized by his voice. She nodded her head without going through her thought process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He then got up feeling satisfied and went to take some clothes to pass to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She reached out her hand to take the clothes, but when she raised her arm, she felt that her arm was extremely sore. She yelped in pain and furrowed her brows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Let me do it,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Huh? Let him do it? Do what?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and later realized that he meant that he would help her get dressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s... It&rsquo;s okay. I can manage on my own!&rdquo; She quickly declined, but her body was not cooperative. Before she could snatch her clothes from him, her arms ached once again and she hummed in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled as he looked at her, finding her current embarrassed and distressed look so cute that he knew he would never get bored of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be shy about anything in front of me. Just like how you can see my body anytime you want to. Do you want to have a look now?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;...&rdquo; &lsquo;Does he realize what a huge temptation his words are!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time he was done helping her get dressed, her face was indescribably red.</p></div>
