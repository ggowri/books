        <h1>Chapter 1311</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're my children too." He slowly began to have a sense of reality once her belly began to show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could feel her belly carrying their babies and that he was going to be a father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're going to be a good father," she said as she stroked his head gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will I?" he muttered. He was not quite sure if he would be a good father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want his children to experience the childhood he had!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she said with great affirmation. Then, she burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you laughing at?" he asked as he looked up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It just occurred to me that once the three babies are born, they'll be surrounding you and asking their daddy for a hug. And you'll be holding the three of them..." It was funny to think about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was immediately rendered speechless. He was a little scared... to imagine it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this family would be a lot livelier when the time came, and she was the one giving him all of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, it's good to have you." He lifted his chin and his face slowly approached her. There seemed to be endless longing in those beautiful black eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because of her that his life started to have color, rather than being black and white like before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled sweetly, lowered her head, and kissed him on the lips, responding to his longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had met him when she was at her lowest. She never thought she would get married, have children, and have a family of her own, but now, he had given her all of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was nice to have him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He made her know that there was someone in this world who was so deeply in love with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace arranged her maternity check-up before the hospital's pregnant women course so she could attend the course right after the check-up. Jason naturally accompanied her throughout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the maternity check-up, Grace's eyes watered again when she saw the three little ones on the ultrasound screen. The babies had started to take shape, and she heard their heartbeats that apparently sounded like train whistles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Jason asked nervously, fearing that she was not feeling well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. I just can't wait to see all three born safe and sound," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of the three children, one was dizygotic while two were identical. However, they could not find out their sex yet. Grace did not plan to find out in advance. She took it as keeping herself some curiosity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would find out when the babies were born.</p></div>
