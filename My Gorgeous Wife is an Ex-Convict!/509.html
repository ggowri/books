        <h1>Chapter 508</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no one expected his self-righteous insistence to collapse so quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the accident happened, he panicked and was frightened. His parents told him to get rid of Grace right away and he did so without even hesitating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was at that moment that he realized that the love he expected was not worth his future. He was not willing to sacrifice his future for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved Grace because he could be the grand young master of the Stevens family. Once this was gone, the so-called love was also gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the years, he would feel guilty sometimes, but whenever he felt guilty, he would tell himself that it was all Grace's fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Things would not have come to this if she had not driven under the influence and hit Jennifer Atkinson, so it was all Grace's fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that only by thinking this way could he feel at ease again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that this was the end for him and Grace. Like two horizons, they would no longer intersect. However, now it seemed as if his life would gradually be filled with her influence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Like with Zoe's legs and now his wife's family's shopping mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all because of Jason. The person behind Grace was now Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sean?!" Lily's voice interrupted his trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He came back to his senses and looked at the gorgeous face in front of him, which was completely different from Grace's face. This woman was a movie star, a famous socialite in the city. She was a goddess in the hearts of many men. In the future, she would inherit all of the Atkinson family's fortune. Such a woman could not be more suitable to be his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course it's you I love! Even without the accident, she and I wouldn't have made it to the end. We weren't meant for each other after all," said Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shall we... get married then?" Lily asked suddenly. Ever since their engagement, they had been addressing each other as husband and wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In high society like theirs, betrothal was similar to marriage. The difference was only the lack of a marriage certificate. This made her feel a little uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean was stunned. "Why the sudden mention of marriage? Didn't you say that you&rsquo;re now popular and getting married would be bad for your career? Besides, if we want to get married, we have to deal with our family's companies first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, a marriage between people like them not only involved each other but also their family's companies and the interests of their two families.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're right," said Lily as she seemed to sober up a little. "I was too impatient. Let our marriage go as planned then, but Sean..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily paused and stared at him. "You must promise me that you'll treat me with all your heart. Whatever I do, it&rsquo;s all for you, so you must never let me down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean could not help feeling breathless under her gaze. It was as if she was implying something. However, he immediately laughed at himself for thinking too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did women not always like to say things like that? They always loved their men making promises to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I'll never do you wrong. You're my wife, the future mistress of the Stevens family!" said Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a satisfied smile, Lily snuggled into Sean's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her gorgeous face turned cold the moment she buried into his arms. Grace... The name was like a thorn, piercing her heart.</p></div>
