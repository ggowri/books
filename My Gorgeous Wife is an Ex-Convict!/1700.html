        <h1>Chapter 1698</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His cold voice murmured. He wanted more of her. He wanted her to get rid of the fear that remained in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though she was alive and well before him, did she know how scared he was earlier? The scene of her nearly falling from the building kept recurring to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Fortunately, he had caught her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Fortunately, he pulled her back into his arms!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Furthermore, she was safe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace..." he uttered hoarsely. It was as though her name had branded into his bones. It was a name forever engraved in his memory...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He swept her damp bangs aside with his fingers and kissed her forehead. "No one can hurt you nor kill you. I won't allow it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He carried her lovingly into the bathroom as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He washed her body gently. She was still asleep, and her pretty face seemed so delicate under the bathroom's soft lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, I'm yours too," he mumbled as he gently dried her body and carried her back to bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She slept soundly, but he was not yet sleepy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">From time to time, the scene of her almost falling from the building kept recurring to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The pain in his heart was very familiar. It was as if he had almost lost her in the same way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It felt as though she was once right in front of him but he could not catch her no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'When exactly? Why can't I remember?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Or... is it something from the memories I lost? They all said she had fallen into the sea and it was an accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did she fall into the sea to get away from me? Was it because she didn't want to be with me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked down at the sleeping face of the person beside him and gently stroked her cheek with his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Grace frowned slightly and mumbled something as though she was talking in her dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He tried to hear what she was saying, but her voice was so soft that he could only make out the word &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; after listening for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;Is she dreaming about me?' Jason's eyes darkened. Her eyebrows furrowed more and more. Her head shook left and right, and a thin layer of sweat broke out on her forehead. She looked like she was trying to get rid of a nightmare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is she... having a nightmare? And is this nightmare about me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's hands grabbed Grace's shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, her voice became louder and he could hear what she was saying. However, his heart sank when he heard it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What she said was... "No, Jay. I won't let you do that... No... I won't forgive you. No..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What... did I do that she won't forgive me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He only felt his heart sinking, and he exerted more force in his fingers that were pressing on her shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ah!" The pain in Grace's shoulders woke her up.</p></div>
