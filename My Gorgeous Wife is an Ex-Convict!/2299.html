        <h1>Chapter 2297</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace narrowed her eyes, while Kyla said, "I told you I won't visit her, and whatever happens to her is up to the law."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Neal Reid seemed to want to add something but was worried about Grace's presence as some things were inconvenient to talk about. "Mrs. Weiss, can we have a few words alone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I don't think it&rsquo;s appropriate or necessary for us to talk alone, Mr. Wu!&rdquo; Kyla refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said to Mr. Wu, "You should stop harassing my friend. Does Jacqueline Bowman think that others are at her beck and call? She's just relying on her kindness to Kyla back then, but that will eventually have to come to an end. You can tell Jacqueline Bowman that she can forget about being spared from prison after she did such things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could more or less figure out why Jacqueline Bowman wanted to see Kyla. She just wanted to bring up her kindness to Kyla in the past and ask for forgiveness so that she could get away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was softhearted. She might forgive Jacqueline Bowman once she saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, women like Jacqueline Bowman would continue to harm Kyla once they were freed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Wu froze before finally leaving reluctantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace escorted Kyla into the store. When Mrs. Corbyn saw her daughter's red and swollen eyes, she immediately said, "What's the matter? What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, it's nothing. I'll talk to you later." Kyla tried to smile to comfort her mother. Then, she turned to Grace and said, "Grace, thank you for sending me back. Why don't you go home? I'll be fine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded, knowing that Kyla wanted to speak to Mrs. Corbyn alone. However, she could not help saying, "Kyla, don't go and see Jacqueline Bowman. She's only trying to get away with her crime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it. Don't worry. I won't see her. Like I said earlier, some kindness will eventually have to come to an end. The same goes for my gratitude to her. It has come to an end," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace left, Mrs. Corbyn hastily asked, "What happened to you? Hurry and tell me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her daughter's eyes were red. She could tell she had been crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, Martin Weiss is getting discharged tomorrow, so... I made it all clear to him today." That short sentence made Mrs. Corbyn understand everything instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Feeling a pang in her heart, Mrs. Corbyn reached out and took her daughter into her arms. "Oh, you and Martin Weiss... have such star-crossed fates! If your father hadn't done the Weiss family wrong, maybe you and him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, Mom. It's all fated, and I've accepted it. Wouldn't it be nice to go on with our lives as usual? Relationships aren't suitable for me at this age. What I regret is that I can't give Nelson and the baby a complete family," muttered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn sighed. Her daughter had always been thoughtful of others but never herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, since her daughter had made up her mind, as her mother, she would be her biggest supporter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason saw Grace, Grace had come to him with slightly red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was talking to Terrence about work arrangements. He immediately got up and hurried over to Grace. "What happened?"</p></div>
