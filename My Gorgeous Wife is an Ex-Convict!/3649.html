        <h1>Chapter 3647</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at William, who was now lowered his head, and with a face filled with despair and bitterness, he almost didn't think twice. He lifted his hand and suddenly embraced him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he was sitting on the bed at the moment, and she was standing, her embrace caused his head to rest against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was momentarily stunned. Her chest was warm, and his face pressed against it, he could also hear the sound of her heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you suddenly holding me like this?" William murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper blushed a little. She had actually hugged him like this when they were younger, but back then it didn't feel strange. Now that they were older, it seemed to have turned into a different kind of feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just wanted to hug you," Jasper said, her face turning red. "You're not a burden at all. Your mom doesn't even know what kind of precious baby she has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A precious baby?" William chuckled. How long has it been since someone described him like that? It seemed like only when he returned to the Barlow family years ago, his grandparents would sometimes call him that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he grew older, fewer and fewer people called him that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one uses 'baby' to describe a man," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But to me, you are my baby, my precious!" Jasper said naturally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was taken aback and looked up at her. "You said that the wrong way around." She should be his baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I didn't," she said, cupping his face with her hands. "Actually, adults always say that when you were at the Reed family, it was thanks to me being with you. But in my eyes, it was you who was with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she had just returned to the Reed family, and for her, the Reed family was still unfamiliar. Her older brother didn't talk much, and Mason didn't live in the Reed House. And although her father was kind to her, they couldn't be together all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daddy and Mommy have a lot of things to take care of every day, while she has to behave and adapt to life in this new city and new home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though there are some servants' children in the Reed family who are not much older than her, whenever those children are with her, they always try to please her intentionally and ask for a lot in return. She even witnessed a few older children whispering behind her back--</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows if she's really Mr. Reed's child!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wasn't it said that she's a triplet? But she looks nothing like the young master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mom said maybe this child was born to the lady with another man while she was away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, she even went to ask Mommy if she was really Daddy's child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And a few days later, those servants' children, along with their parents, were all dismissed from the Reed House and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she actually had no friends in the Reed House.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was his appearance that finally gave her a true friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, because you're with me, I've been able to be happy since I was little. Even in times of sadness and pain, I don't feel so bad," Jasper said, then pressed his lips against the other's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was slightly startled, but then he went along with her kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he really was her treasure, then he wished to be forever...</span></p></div>
