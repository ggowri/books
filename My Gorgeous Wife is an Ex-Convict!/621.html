        <h1>Chapter 620</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should have held her tight from the beginning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, why are you drinking alone?" Patrick's voice suddenly rang in Brian's ear. "You rarely come here. Isn&rsquo;t it boring to drink alone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Boring?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned the glass in his hand and glanced at the people around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only reason he agreed to attend Patrick's party today was simply that he had been so stressed these days, he wanted to take a breather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after he came, he found that it was still the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All he could think about was Grace, and he could not get her out of his head at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I heard that you and Jason seemed to have some conflict earlier. What happened?" asked Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at his old friend with a half-smile. "You're well-informed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was stunned. "Really?" He had heard the news through the grapevine, but it turned out to be true. "How did you get into trouble with Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had known each other since little. Patrick believed that in their social circle, the two least likely to fall out were Jason and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men were too rational and weighed the pros and cons of everything. Jason was indifferent to everything&mdash;Of course, that was before he met Grace. Patrick found out at the last banquet that Jason cared about a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Brian, in Patrick's opinion, the fellow always had an aloof attitude toward people. The only thing Brian cared about was the owner of the bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even among their social circle, they were betting how long Brian would take to find the owner of the bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to know?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it a business conflict between the Hart familyHart family and the Reed family?" Patrick asked after some thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was so lazy that he made no answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Surely you're not fighting over a woman," mumbled Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if we are?" answered Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick looked shocked. "You&hellip; You and Jason..." Well... If they were really fighting over a woman, then was it... Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was immediately stressed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not find Grace very attractive. Besides, she had been to prison. Why did both of them&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you looking for the owner of the bracelet? Why argue with Jason about a woman? Besides, it looks like Jason is going to marry Grace, so don't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was not done talking, but Brian suddenly rose from his chair. His expression was not at all casual and relaxed like before, but anxious. "What did you say? Marry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes&hellip; Yes, I... I heard that Jason bought the Frozen Heart diamond to make a wedding ring."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Patrick finished talking, Brian dashed toward the exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick stared at Brian's back, feeling a little overwhelmed.</p></div>
