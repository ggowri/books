        <h1>Chapter 2917</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the car, Brian Hart's expression was cold and frozen. The difference between him and Barbara Schuman was that Barbara Schuman had targeted Valda Theller for her own selfish desires, while he had done all of this for Valda Theller!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car arrived at an abandoned factory, which was already surrounded by Brian Hart's men. As soon as Brian Hart got out of the car, someone approached him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, the person is inside," the subordinate said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't let anyone in," Brian Hart ordered coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the subordinate replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart walked into the abandoned factory, a huge empty room filled with dust and cobwebs. At the center of the room, a man was lying on the ground in a miserable state, obviously having been severely beaten. Three people were standing around the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the three people saw Brian Hart, they immediately greeted him respectfully, "Mr. Hart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of them stepped forward and handed a stack of photos to Brian Hart, "These were found on him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart lowered his head and looked through the folded photos in his hand. All the people in these photos were Valda Theller and Raymond Bowman. However, the more he looked, the more his face darkened. Valda Theller and Raymond Bowman were very close in the photos, in a suggestive pose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and Raymond Bowman... Brian Hart's heart suddenly felt a sharp pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you get these photos?" Brian Hart asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man lying on the ground was already trembling all over. "I... I took them myself. At the wrap party... I... I just happened to go to the bathroom and saw them, so I took the photos... I didn't know who this woman was at first, I only knew this man, Raymond Bowman. But who knew that later, when I went back to the hall, you helped this woman block the wine, and I... I knew who she was!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Originally, the man just wanted to take these photos and see if he could get some money from Raymond Bowman. After all, some wealthy people don't want their privacy to be photographed. But who knew that the development of the situation later was beyond his expectations. When Raymond Bowman publicly said those things and Brian Hart blocked the wine for Valda Theller, he knew that he couldn't go to Raymond Bowman to extort money with these photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for trying to extort money from Brian Hart, he never even thought about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He originally thought that these photos could only rot in his hands, but unexpectedly, someone contacted him suddenly and asked if he had taken photos of Raymond Bowman and Valda Theller, and the other party was willing to buy them at a high price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, he was willing to sell them. As for what the other party wanted to do with these photos, he didn't ask, he just made it clear that if something happened in the future, it had nothing to do with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But who could have thought that before the transaction was even made, he was pressed to the ground by someone and beaten up, and the photos were also taken away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What surprised him even more was that Mr. Hart had appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who did you make the deal with?" Brian Hart asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phoebe Cross, Miss Cross," the subordinate replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A cold light flashed in Brian Hart's eyes, "Where is she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In the car outside. Miss Cross got into the car and tried to escape. We used the car to stop her, but she refused to get out," the subordinate said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Brian Hart simply said, "Lead the way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So the subordinate quickly led Brian Hart to Phoebe Cross's car. At this moment, Phoebe Cross was in the car, her face pale, her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, but the car couldn't move forward. Her car was surrounded by cars, and she couldn't get out!</p></div>
