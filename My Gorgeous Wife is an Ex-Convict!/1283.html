        <h1>Chapter 1282</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I trust her. She's going to be my wife, the one I'm going to be with for the rest of my life. Am I supposed to trust you if I don't trust her?" he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The words hurt her like a sharp sword.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she was already numb and indifferent to whatever harsh words he would say, but it turned out... a simple sentence like that still affected her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I'm begging you to check, okay? I just want to know if she took Nelson. I'll leave right away if she didn't. I won't get in your way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do I have to check just because you&rsquo;re asking me to? Kyla Corbyn, who do you think you are?" Martin Weiss asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's face was pale. She did not even know how to beg the man in front of her. Maybe it did not matter to the man even if she died in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I know we're fighting over Nelson's custody, but the case hasn't started and the verdict hasn't been decided yet. You can't take Nelson away from me now, okay?" she begged, almost in her humblest tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was cold. She had once said that even in hell, they would never meet again and ruthlessly stabbed her stomach with a broken shard of glass. However, she could also be so submissive for her son's sake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many sides to her did she have that he had never seen before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, please... I beg you." Her dark eyes were already wet with moisture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked so fragile. It was as if one more blow from him would make her break down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I kneel, beg, and grovel to you? As long as you give Nelson back to me. At least give me back Nelson before the trial is decided..." She was about to kneel, and almost on impulse, he took her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough!" he cried out in a low voice. Somehow, he did not want to see her so fragile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He picked up his phone and dialed a number. After giving a few orders, he said to Kyla Corbyn, "Wait here for a while. We'll find out soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly said, "Okay, I'll wait. I'll wait." Then, she stood aside and waited quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the person in front of him. She was wearing cheap clothes, and her long hair was simply tied with the cheapest hairband. Her skin did not look as fair and tender as it did back then, and the hands hanging by her sides were so rough. They were a far cry from the delicate hands he remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could say that he had made her the way she was. If he had let Paisley settled out of court and drop the charges, then she would not have been imprisoned for three and a half years and would not have become the way she was now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, instead of joy, he felt heartache at the way she looked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, Martin Weiss's phone rang. Kyla Corbyn was taken aback and nervously stared at the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss answered the phone, and after hearing their reply, he said to Kyla Corbyn, "Paisley didn't take Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She didn't?' Kyla Corbyn could not tell if she was relieved or more nervous. If it was not Paisley Daniels, where was Nelson?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for checking for me." With that, she turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly grabbed her arm. "Do you know where to go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "I don't know, but I'm going to find him! And the police will be looking for him too."</p></div>
