        <h1>Chapter 245</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The whole crew had to act by her will. Even though Grace was saved by Brian once, it was only a minor incident. No one in the crew would offend her for a mere extra.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director arranged for everyone to take their places so that they could start shooting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when they were about to film the scene where everybody kneeled, a production assistant in the crew hurriedly ran over to the director and told him something. The director's face changed at once. He got up to rush to the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone except those who were filming looked curiously in the direction of the director, wondering what might have happened to make him leave in such a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They only saw the director come up to a man in a beige trench coat. He bent slightly as if to say something. Seeing the director's actions, many people assumed that the man was not a simple man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, the director, who also had a certain reputation in the industry, would never do that to an outsider.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, in a deferential gesture, the director and the man walked toward the original shooting place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the man came near, quite a few people recognized who the man was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, screenshots from the previous live stream were still circulating on the internet, and most of the people here were from the entertainment industry, so they naturally paid attention to this kind of hot gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, both Evelyn and Lily were stunned at Jason's sudden appearance. Then, they involuntarily set their eyes on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe... Jason was here because of Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both of them suddenly took on a ghastly expression, especially Evelyn who had a hard time getting Grace here today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Jason was here, how could she follow her plan? After all, Jason's relationship with Grace was, to put it bluntly, unclear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came here today only because I have a friend who's filming here. I won't be disrupting your filming if I come and check on her, right?" Jason chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People who did not know him might have thought that he was a gentleman with a charming temper, but only those who knew him would know that his smile and gentleness were only illusions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Of course not! I wonder who your friend is, Mr. Reed?" the director asked. He was guessing who it was in his mind, recalling the main female lead to the ninth female lead of this film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's right over there." Jason raised his chin in the direction of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Over there?" The director blinked and peered. There was only a group of extras there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be that this friend of Young Master Reeds&hellip; was an extra?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed impossible! Therefore, the director desperately looked behind the extras, trying to find out if any actresses were standing behind them, but he did not see any. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You haven't started yet, have you?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," the director answered quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll go over and have a word with her. My friend seemed to have run into trouble last time, so I came here today to cheer her up," Jason said and walked over to Grace.</p></div>
