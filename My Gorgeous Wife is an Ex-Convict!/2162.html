        <h1>Chapter 2160</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Tell me if you have an explanation. You wouldn't push others for nothing, would you?" Grace continued saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You won&rsquo;t believe me even if I tell you!" said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How do you know I won't believe you if you don't tell me?" Grace asked in reply. "Did you forget I'm a lawyer? If you have an explanation for it or you&rsquo;re wronged, I&rsquo;ll clear your name. But if you deliberately pushed Nelson down the stairs, I&rsquo;ll have to punish you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was silent for a moment before whispering, "I heard a sound heading toward Nelson Corbyn, so I tried to push him away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"A sound? What do you mean?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There was a sound." William was too young to describe what he had heard, so that was all he could explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace pondered for a moment. "Was there nothing else but a sound? You have to show me proof if you want to convince me that you didn't mean to push Nelson. How can I find proof with only a sound?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked down again. Yes, he had no proof, so what did it matter even if he told her? It did not make any difference anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After that, William refused to say anything more no matter how much Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing this, Grace did not ask further but asked the child to go back to his room first. She told him to come look for her if he recalled anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Watching the little one walk out of the room with his head hung low, Grace felt a little heavy-hearted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, Nelson had grabbed the handrail in time. Otherwise, she would not know how to face Kyla. After all, she was the one who brought William there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... a sound? I don't think William is lying to me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, William had always been obedient during his time in Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could sense that the boy was sensitive and had low self-esteem. She often put him together with Jasper and Mick, hoping he could become more cheerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps she had to go to Lina's place again to investigate and see what the sound was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William had just walked out of the study when he saw Jasper standing there angrily. She glared at him and said, "Why did you push Nelson down the stairs? Nelson's such a nice boy. He could have died when you pushed him down the stairs like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Children at this age already had an idea of what life and death were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her anger stung him. She had never been so angry with him before, and it was because of Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I wasn&rsquo;t trying to push him down the stairs," he muttered. He was only trying to push Nelson Corbyn away because of the sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Furious that he would not admit it, she snapped. "I saw it with my own eyes! Let's go to the hospital. You'll apologize to Nelson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Apologize? Why should I apologize? I didn't mean to push Nelson Corbyn down the stairs at all, but to apologize would be to admit that I did it on purpose!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I'm not apologizing," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She got even angrier when he said so. "Why won't you apologize?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why should I apologize?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because you pushed Nelson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I didn't mean to push him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But you did!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two children argued in the corridor while many of the maids stood a distance away.</p></div>
