        <h1>Chapter 419</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn thought of earlier when she pulled Grace aside to ask about it. She had given her a definite answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Kyla. He's the Jason from Reed Group." Well, that was what Grace said to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn felt as if her head had been hit by wave after wave of thunder. She was a little overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was the delivery girl in her restaurant Jason's girlfriend? Who would believe it if she told them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace said she still had food to deliver, Jason unexpectedly said, "Then I'll wait for you here. I'm free anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then went out to deliver food while Jason stayed here and read his book!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn thought she had been through a lot, but now she was a little confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why would Grace work for her when she had a boyfriend of this caliber? Was Jason&hellip; serious about Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the way they were around each other did not look fake. At least an outsider like her could see that Jason was completely doting on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing that Jason had finished his cup of coffee, Kyla Corbyn stepped forward and asked, "Would you like anything else, Mr. Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just give me a glass of water," replied Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Kyla Corbyn gave Jason another glass of water. Just as she was about to walk away, Jason said, "Wait a minute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there anything else?" asked Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take a seat." Jason pointed to the empty chair opposite him. "There's something I'd like to talk to you about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn felt a sudden uneasiness in her heart, but she sat down anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace wants to earn her own living, and I'm not going to stop her. She's also impressed with you and your son. She seems satisfied with her current job, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m letting her be. I just want her to be happy," said Jason. His eyes were on Kyla Corbyn, but they seemed somewhat sharp. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's heart trembled suddenly. The fear in her heart was now more pronounced. "My son and I... like Grace too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In that case, good. I don't mind giving you a hand if you get into any trouble, but I hope you're sincere. Don&rsquo;t take advantage of her. If you violate this rule, don't blame me for getting back at you," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Kyla Corbyn could finish, Jason said, "Martin Weiss has been looking for you all these years, right? However, you were clever enough to bribe the prison staff. Then you went into hiding and changed your household registration information. This also means that he won't be able to find you if he doesn't work harder."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn almost jumped out of her chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He... He knew! He would not have known these things if he had never investigated her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... investigated me?" asked Kyla Corbyn with her eyes wide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Since Grace wanted to work for you, I naturally had to conduct a background check on everyone in this restaurant. However, Grace doesn't know that, and I don't want her to," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn got the idea that Jason was warning her. Did Grace know that this man was protecting her in areas she did not know about?</p></div>
