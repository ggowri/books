        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw him standing in front of me. It had been years since we last saw each other, but it felt like only yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really you?" I asked, my voice trembling with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled, that same charming smile that I remembered so well. "Yes, it's me," he replied, his voice deep and soothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We stood there for a moment, just looking at each other, taking in every detail. The years had been kind to him, and he looked even more handsome than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought I'd see you again," I said, my heart overflowing with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me neither," he said, his eyes never leaving mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We talked for hours, catching up on everything that had happened since we last saw each other. It was like we were picking up where we left off as if no time had passed at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sun began to set, we said our goodbyes, promising to keep in touch this time. I watched him walk away, feeling grateful for this unexpected reunion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who knows what the future holds for us, but for now, I was just happy to have him back in my life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This medicine is just a temporary sleeping pill that can help you sleep for a few hours. It won't harm your body," Lornell said. "But I have to make it clear, once I bring you into the Quentin family, no matter if you can change Chandler's mind in the end, you must fulfill your promise to the Quentin family. If you and Chandler don't have a second child, then you still have to provide your blood sample for the Quentin family to study."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Tina responded, without any objections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And soon, drowsiness crept in. Her eyelids slowly drooped, it seemed like the Quentin family's medicine was working pretty fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she opened her eyes, she would be able to see Chandler... Tina thought to herself, letting the drowsiness take over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell glanced at Tina, who was sleeping in the back seat, and let out a disdainful laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's really confusing, why did she insist on getting a divorce before if she truly loves Chandler?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Chandler finally gave up, he wanted to win her back! But now, the price to pay is much higher than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emotions can be such a troublesome thing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lornell thought about it, Harley's face flashed through his mind. He remembered her asking him if he liked her before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't know why, but at this moment, just thinking about Harley's expression, made him feel uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it, don't think about it too much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell said to himself, then drove towards the Quentin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt like she had just woken up from a long dream. In the dream, she went back to the Stephenson family and didn't resist Chandler's advances. Instead, she naturally ended up with him, as if she hadn't lost her memory at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even later, when I heard that Chandler had a curse on him, from the moment he approached her mother to when he proposed to her, it was all just to break the curse on the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in her dream, when she heard these words, she didn't feel angry. Instead, she felt a pang of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged Chandler willingly and told him that she was willing to help him get rid of the curse and relieve his pain from now on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then they successfully gave birth to their second child. With the curse lifted from his body, he no longer needed to endure the pain of the insects. Yet, he still loved her deeply, and their child as well...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dream was so blissful and wonderful that she didn't want to wake up from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she had made that choice back then, how much better would it have been? Why couldn't she see his love for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did she think that his love for her was all fake, just for the sake of the parasite, for the curse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even without the gu worms and curse, she believed he would still love her deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina..." A familiar voice echoed in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice sounded so familiar, like the one she couldn't help but long for, so gentle...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina... Tina..." The voice continued to call out her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina struggled to open her eyes, and the first thing she saw was a familiar face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Chandler!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's eyes widened in shock as she stared at the person in front of her. The scenes from her dream flashed through her mind once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, I met Chandler, the real Chandler!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's eyes welled up with tears, streaming down her cheeks. She couldn't hold back her emotions any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it turns out, when she saw him again, she realized that she missed him so much!</span></p></div>
