        <h1>Chapter 2420</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was over, Kyla suddenly raised her hand and slapped Martin Weiss. "If you have no feelings for me, don't do that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You don't like it? Don't forget that we're still married. It's perfectly justified even if I have my way with you! Don't forget the conditions I made in return for agreeing to your request..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His angry voice was choked back into his throat when he saw tears in her eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many times had she slapped him? He was the chairman of Weiss Group. Few people dared to do that to him, but the tears in her eyes seemed to extinguish the fury within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt as if his chest was being weighed down by something heavy, leaving him breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, she pushed him away, took a deep breath, and said calmly, "Mr. Weiss, I understand that you have no feelings for me, so I have no intention of tempting you in any way. If the words I said earlier about not being able to help myself bothered you, I can assure you that it won't happen again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were almost pressed into a straight line. Why did it upset him to hear her say that and to be looked at indifferently by her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if something was missing...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">... </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went to pick up her daughter at the Barlow family&rsquo;s house, she learned from Philip Barlow that Amber Mitchell had been transferred by the Mitchell family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When did this happen?" Grace was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow said, "I found out about ten minutes ago and was about to call you. It seems that the Mitchell family has been alerted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Do you know where the Mitchell family transferred Amber Mitchell to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We need to investigate that. I'm afraid we won't find out so soon," said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that it was no use worrying now. She first had to find out where the Mitchell family had transferred Amber Mitchell to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did Amber Mitchell's attending doctor receive any money from the Mitchell family? I hope you can help me look into that, Mr. Barlow," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No problem," replied Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason then picked up their daughter in preparation to leave. However, Jasper looked reluctant to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, can I stay in Deer City a few days longer? William said there are many interesting places in Deer City. I haven't even visited them yet!" Jasper could not help saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's Monday tomorrow, and you have to attend kindergarten. You can come to Deer City to visit William next time during winter break," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But winter break is still a long time away. I want to spend more time with William. I still have so many things to tell William!" the little one said gloomily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then stay here for a few more days," Jason said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper instantly looked surprised, while Grace seemed puzzled. "How many more days are we going to stay?"</p></div>
