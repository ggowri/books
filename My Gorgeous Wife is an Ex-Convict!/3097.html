        <h1>Chapter 3095</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body suddenly stiffened, and then she felt his head lowered, buried in her shoulder, with hot breath spraying on her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I caused you so much pain," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's lips curled with a hint of bitterness. Since her return, the phrase she heard the most was "I'm sorry"... but she didn't really want to hear those three words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These three words only make her feel like everyone is trying desperately to make it up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seems like they all feel guilty towards her, as if they are all responsible for her injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she would rather they treat her with a normal attitude, maybe that way she can feel like she's just an ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, please don't feel like you owe me anything. You don't owe me anything," said Valda. She lifted her hand and tried to pull his hand away from her waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But he held her tighter instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I know you don't want me to make it up to you because of guilt, but it's not out of guilt that I say I love you. It's because I love you that it hurts me even more to hear about what happened to you this past year. You're the person I want to protect, but you've suffered so much, and I... couldn't do anything to help you when you were in pain..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian murmured, his voice hoarse with bitterness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda bit her lip and after a while said, "It's all in the past now, I'm fine now, aren't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned her body around to face him, "So what about us, is it all in the past too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We..." She opened her mouth, wanting to be firm and say what she had thought about many times, but his gaze gave her an inexplicable sense of oppression, making those words seem stuck in her throat and unable to be spoken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, don't even think about leaving me, let alone not taking responsibility for me!" Brian said fiercely, "You know, I've never been a good man, and I won't just leave a woman high and dry. I don't care what you think, but I love you, and you should never doubt that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, his lips were already on hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to push him away, but he wouldn't let her budge an inch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A passionate kiss, filled with longing and yearning, and she once again found herself lost in his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Can she really trust that he loves her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Can she stand by his side once again? If the Hart family's mistress becomes disabled, will it tarnish the reputation of the entire Hart family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She doesn't know how to face it, afraid that as time goes by, she will end up with his disgusted gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, she wants to be the one to end this relationship by speaking up herself. At least this way, she will feel better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now... everything seems to be out of control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was completely powerless to resist as long as he wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just because she loved him too much...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Until Brian put her back on the bed again, she suddenly realized what was happening and panicked, saying, "Don't... don't do this, I... I don't want to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yesterday's accident can happen once, but it cannot happen again for a second or third time... Otherwise, everything will only get worse.</p></div>
