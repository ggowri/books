        <h1>Chapter 3308</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Valda finally finished writing. She handed the notebook to Brian with a smile and said, "It's your turn to write now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." He responded, picking up a pen and writing in the notebook. "Baby, I'm glad you could come to be with me and your mommy. If you're wondering why you exist, daddy will tell you it's because he loves your mommy very much, and that's why you're here. The luckiest thing that ever happened to daddy in his life was probably meeting your mommy, because of her, we have a very happy home. Although we don't know if you're a boy or a girl yet, daddy and mommy will love you very much and take good care of you as you grow up..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian is writing diligently, recording his happiness and expectations bit by bit...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future, he will flip through this journal with his children. At that time, he will slowly tell his and Valda's story to his children, bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tell the child how much he truly loves Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The New Year is approaching. As it draws nearer, many people become increasingly busy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Valda is quite the opposite, she is never idle... always busy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She feels a bit anxious because she has too much free time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The manga work at hand has ended. The remaining work will have to wait until after she gives birth and completes her postpartum confinement before considering starting a new serialization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for buying New Year's goods, cleaning and decorating, these are all ordinary tasks that housewives would do, but she doesn't have to do any of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Basically, Brian or the servants did most of the work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He seems to be afraid that she might hurt herself with even the slightest movement, as if she were made of glass. She even suspects that if she weren't pregnant and unable to be carried like a princess, he would carry her everywhere without letting her walk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before the New Year, Camille came to chat with her friend. Seeing her friend's rounder face, Camille exclaimed, "I envy you so much for your wonderful foodie life. So many people wish for it but can't have it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you for your envy," Valda said speechlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm serious," said Camille. "There aren't many pregnant women who have as much free time as you do. I never realized before that Brian dotes on his wife so much. I used to think he was cold and distant, and I thought that even if he got married, he would still expect his wife to accommodate him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now it seems that after marriage, Brian has been accommodating Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's pretty good, but sometimes I feel like Brian is a bit too cautious," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's because he cares about you. If you were with someone who didn't care, you'd see how they would treat you!" Camille said. "You have to understand, Prince Hart had a reputation for being cold. All those female celebrities in the entertainment industry, whether they were famous or not, who wouldn't want to become Mrs. Hart? But no matter how tempting or desperate they were, they couldn't move Prince Hart. You can imagine how cold he was. But now... tsk tsk..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Camille spoke, she shook her head and wiggled around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If anyone saw what Prince Hart was like after marriage, they would probably be shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It can only be said that sometimes the colder a man is, the more surprising he may be after marriage.</p></div>
