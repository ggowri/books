        <h1>Chapter 4185 Shadow</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In a remote village in the mountains with inconvenient transportation, there is a small village that is quite backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A pregnant woman is working in the fields, sweat constantly dripping from her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The people here only call her "Drogo's wife" because she was picked up by Drogo, and everyone says that the child in her belly is also Drogo's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she knows it's not true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although she has forgotten everything, even her own name, she knows that the child in her belly is definitely not Drogo's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There have been several times when Drogo tried to violate her in the middle of the night, and she struggled desperately. She even grabbed something and hit Drogo's head, causing him to bleed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had originally wanted to escape from Drogo's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, she was captured back by Drogo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because this village is backward, the villagers sometimes unite and help Drogo watch over her, preventing her from escaping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As her belly grew, Drogo became more obedient, but he frequently nagged that once the child was born, she would become his legitimate wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She knew she had to escape, but now her belly was getting bigger and it was becoming more difficult to move. If she waited until the child was born to escape, the chances would be even smaller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Moreover... she could feel that Drogo despised the child in her belly. Every time, he would stare at her belly with a poisonous gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If the child was born, she even doubted whether the child could survive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had to escape while she still had some mobility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She knew that today there was a ceremonial event in the village, the once-a-year big event in the village. Drogo and his parents would go to watch the ceremony, and at that time, she would be locked in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tonight was the chance to escape, as long as... she could manage to unlock that lock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Nightfall came quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As she expected, Drogo's family locked her in the room and locked the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She carefully pulled out an iron wire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She accidentally discovered it while working and secretly kept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At this moment, her hand reached through the door crack, holding the lock cylinder, while her other hand held a thin wire, turning it inside to unlock the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She couldn't remember how she learned to pick locks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It seemed like there was a voice deep in her memory whispering to her, "Tina, if you learn how to pick locks, at least you'll have one more skill. In case of any emergencies, you can save yourself. But I hope that you'll never have to use these self-saving skills, because that would mean you're always safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Whose voice was it? Who was speaking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Was Tina calling her? Is her name Tina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But when she tried hard to recall, her head throbbed painfully, preventing her from remembering anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Click!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The lock opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She felt a glimmer of joy and cautiously pushed open the wooden door, walking out quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had already investigated the road out of the village during her time working in the fields.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Now, as long as she could leave the village before the ceremony ended, perhaps she and the child in her belly could be safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Baby, please bless Mommy so that she can take you and leave safely!" She lowered her head and spoke to her swollen belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She suddenly felt a movement in her belly, as if the child was responding to her!</p></div>
