        <h1>Chapter 801</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that the woman still wanted to join the entertainment industry through the crown prince! Many people said that even if she was a pig, as long as the crown prince was willing to help her, she would become the best actress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Looking at Grace now, Brian has probably forgotten about her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz could not help but laugh at the thought of this. She wanted to see how arrogant Grace could be without Jason and Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hotel's presidential suite, Kyla glared at Martin Weiss who was sitting on a couch not far away with a laptop on his lap. He was doing some last-minute work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been held by him since last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If this went on any further, it would be dark again soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to the current situation, it was unknown until when Martin Weiss would keep her there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the small restaurant, she had to call her employees to take a day off and close the restaurant for the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could only laugh at the thought of Martin Weiss's request to have a baby last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does the man think I am? An object? I can bear children when he wants one, and I can't when he doesn't?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, I'm just an object, aren't I?' Kyla then laughed at herself. 'From the very beginning, I'm just a tool for him to get revenge on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The only one he loves is probably Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He gave his gentleness, love, and care to Paisley Daniels and left me with nothing but cruelty!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her phone rang. Kyla looked at her phone and saw that it was a phone call from her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some hesitation, she answered, not wanting to arouse his suspicion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn's anxious voice immediately sounded from the other end of the line. "Why did you close the restaurant today? What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I met Martin Weiss." That was all Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, there was a suffocating silence on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, I'll take care of things here. Don't worry." With that, Kyla hurriedly finished the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mother should know what to do when she said it like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For now, the most important thing was to protect Nelson. Martin Weiss could not know that Nelson was his child no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take care? I'd like to know how you're going to take care of it." Suddenly, Martin Weiss's voice rang in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's body suddenly stiffened. She slowly raised her head and looked at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She saw that the laptop that had been lying in his lap was now on the end table beside him. He picked up the bottle of mineral water nearby, casually unscrewed the cap, and drank it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people seemed attractive even if they were just drinking water.</p></div>
