        <h1>Chapter 857</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, as if possessed, he kissed the woman&rsquo;s seductive lips&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Um... Something seems to be pressing my lips. It's so hot&hellip;' Grace was so drowsy that she could only vaguely feel something on her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her instinct was to escape it, but she could not seem to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she slowly regained consciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, someone's kissing me!' She instinctively opened her eyes, but they were filled with darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's a hand! It feels like a hand.' A hand was covering her eyes, so she could not see anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss deepened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who is it? Who's kissing me?' Grace was full of fear, struggling almost with all her might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her struggle was subdued by an absolute force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not break free nor escape. However, she suddenly caught a whiff of a familiar scent accompanied by the kiss that made her tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... Jason?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had been the most intimate with each other, so how could she not know his scent? Besides, this kiss... This familiar feeling...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It had to be him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is he kissing me? Why is it like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, I don't want it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a sharp bite and her mouth was instantly filled with a smell of blood&hellip; Then, she heard his grunts of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he soon planted an even stronger and more powerful kiss. It was like a storm, almost leaving her breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let... Let me go... Let me..." she stammered, trying desperately to pull his hand away from her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment her eyes seemed to see the light in the room, a hand struck her at the back of her neck, making her faint. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the person he knocked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He almost lost control and just wanted to have his way with her here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her struggles only intensified his desires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Under the lamplight, a trail of blood dripped from the corner of his lips. It looked so shocking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers gently wiped the blood on the corner of his mouth. This was... the pain she gave him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even wanted to cherish this pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I possessed? I'll take anything she gives me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Whether it hurts or not&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace..." his hoarse voice muttered. His mouth was full of that strong bloody smell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips once again kissed hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One by one, countless kisses fell on her face and body&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His infatuation&hellip; was beyond control!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if his mind was going against his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more he wanted to stop loving her, the more he was unable to control his desire!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even wanted to bind her firmly to his side so that she could never... fall in love with another man!</p></div>
