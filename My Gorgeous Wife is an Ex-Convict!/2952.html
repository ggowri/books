        <h1>Chapter 2950</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, hearing his words made her heart feel a sourness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...since I promised to stay here with you, how could I not be here? Even if I really have to leave, I will tell you before I go." Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know, but sometimes, knowing is one thing, but being afraid is another." He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sourness in her chest became even more intense, and even her nose felt sour. She had an urge to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many times has this man used the word "afraid" today? Despite being the prince of the entertainment industry and having the power to control the fate of many, he is still someone that many people aspire to flatter and please, but can never reach. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now... it's so full of anxiety and uncertainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And all of this, because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their breakup was painful for her, but it was also painful for him, too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda lifted her hand and directly grabbed Brian's wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her with some surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Or, we could sleep together so you don't have to stand there watching me like this," she suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying this, she seemed to feel a bit uneasy and quickly added, "I just meant... sleeping together in the same bed, I didn't mean to do anything to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's okay if you want to do something to me, it might even be something I've been hoping for," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's face turned red, as if she always blushes easily in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, can you really do this? If it's difficult for you, you don't have to force yourself to sleep with me just for my sake," Brian asked seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... don't feel like it's a force," she gathered her courage and met his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Or perhaps, she was also looking forward to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to touch his body, to cuddle with each other, to feel the solid sense of being together again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian got into bed and lay down next to Valda. They leaned their heads on the pillow and looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Later... you can stay a little further away from me. I'm afraid I might accidentally touch your wound if I sleep in a bad position," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be careful, but even if I do touch it, it's not a big deal," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... then I'll go to sleep first," she quickly closed her eyes. She was afraid that if she continued to look at him like this, she would be tempted to do something she shouldn't do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who says only men are impulsive? Women are the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Valda with her eyes closed, Brian's eyes were full of tenderness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips curved into a smile, feeling grateful that she was willing to come back to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she didn't come back to him, then his future life wouldn't be happy anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda thought that she wouldn't be able to sleep if Brian was next to her, but surprisingly, she slept soundly until morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His breath surrounded her nose, giving her an inexplicable sense of security and allowing her to sleep more soundly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Opening my eyes, what I saw was his sleeping face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This is a top-notch benefit! As soon as you open your eyes, you can see such a divine face!</p></div>
