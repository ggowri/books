        <h1>Chapter 2341</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, I still have something to take care of. I'll take her with me first. She's not going to eat with you." With that said, Martin Weiss led Kyla out of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sitting alone in the private room, Mrs. Weiss's eyes were full of anger. Her son excelled in everything, and she hardly ever had to worry about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her son was a mess in romantic relationships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he was involved with Kyla again. She was afraid that her son would lose his life for Kyla one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Karma! This is karma!" Mrs. Weiss sighed bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss led Kyla out of the club. Before she could speak, she was stuffed into the backseat of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shouted, "Martin Weiss! What are you doing? Where are you taking me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since it's time to eat, we're going for a meal first," said Martin Weiss before instructing the driver to drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car drove slowly away from the club, Kyla twisted her wrist to free herself from Martin Weiss's grasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I hadn&rsquo;t appeared today, were you going to accept my mother's request and never appear before me again?" His voice rang nonchalantly in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla instantly stiffened. The car was filled with a sense of danger that made her hair stand on end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she might not be able to afford the consequences if she gave the wrong answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent, unable to utter the word &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly leaned over, his face close to Kyla's cheek. "Since you've appeared in front of me and insisted on disturbing me, it's not up to you to decide if you&rsquo;ll never see me again!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, the car drove up to a restaurant. Martin Weiss got out with Kyla and entered a restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss." A manager came forward. "Do you still wish to sit at your usual spot?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Martin Weiss answered indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager then respectfully led the two people to a relatively quiet table with a screen on three sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the head of the Weiss family had brought a pregnant woman here for a meal, the manager would not show the slightest curiosity to things he should not be curious about... despite secretly dying from curiosity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said to Kyla, "Order whatever you want. Also, the porridge here is pretty good. It's easy to digest. You can order some."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've never been here before. I don't know what tastes good. Why don't you order?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss glanced at Kyla and ordered light-tasting foods. It was obvious he was taking Kyla's pregnancy into account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dishes were soon served.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a plate of shrimp. Kyla was about to peel some, but he said, "Let me do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he took over the plate of shrimps and began to peel the shells with his long fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze instantly. He used to peel shrimps for her back when they were dating. She was so happy at the time, thinking she was the happiest woman in the world because her boyfriend was so gentle and thoughtful. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had no idea that his gentleness and thoughtfulness were only because he wanted to take revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to take revenge for what her father did to the Weiss family. As he was gone, she had to stand in her father&rsquo;s place and face Martin Weiss&rsquo;s revenge. </p></div>
