        <h1>Chapter 375</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a hassle to visit the grave. Additionally, as time went by, the tombstone began to crack. It cost a huge fortune to repair it. Hence, it was a much better option to move the grave to a proper cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace ended up in jail and thus, the idea was put on hold. After serving her sentence, Grace was left with not much money. Hence, not only was she unable to afford to pay for a place in a cemetery, but she could not even afford the labor fee for the workers to help her move the grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace arrived at the foot of the hill, she saw that the villagers had set up a registration counter under a makeshift tent. Many people were coming and going to visit the cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was Grace&rsquo;s turn in line, she gave her mother&rsquo;s grave number. To her surprise, the person handling the registration counter immediately responded after hearing the number by saying, &ldquo;That grave was moved. What are you still doing here?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Moved?&rdquo; Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, it was, by a man named Tony Cummins. I think he&rsquo;s the husband of the deceased.&rdquo; The person at the counter looked up the man&rsquo;s information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly recalled that her father had used the matter of moving the grave to ask her to make a trip home. However, when she got home, her father and stepmother&rsquo;s main focus was not on moving the grave but on Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thus, Grace did not ponder on the issue. Nevertheless, she was not expecting her father to have suddenly moved her mother&rsquo;s grave without saying a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Do you know where he moved the grave?&rdquo; Grace urgently asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I have no idea about that. We only settled the paperwork regarding people moving the grave out. We did not ask where they were moving it!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip and asked further, &ldquo;Could... could I go up to have a look? I&rsquo;ll register and just take a look at the spot. If it has been moved, I&rsquo;ll come down immediately.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person noticed how anxious and pale Grace looked and thus did not give her much trouble by allowing her to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost ran up the mountain. When she arrived at the place that used to be her mother&rsquo;s grave, she was greeted with an empty pit. Not even the tombstone was left. Nothing. Other than the pit, only a pile of soil could be seen next to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;It... has been moved!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned for a moment before she took out her phone and dialed her father&rsquo;s number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only after the phone rang for a long time, did the call finally connected. On the other end of the line, Tony Cummins&rsquo;s voice was heard, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Did you move mum&rsquo;s grave?&rdquo; Grace got straight to the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins impatiently replied, &ldquo;So what if I did? Why? This unfilial daughter finally remembers her mother&rsquo;s grave?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Where did you shift mum&rsquo;s grave?&rdquo; Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Ha! You&rsquo;re concerned about your mother&rsquo;s grave now? Didn&rsquo;t you say that you don&rsquo;t acknowledge this family anymore? I don&rsquo;t think you need to know where your mother&rsquo;s grave is.&rdquo; Tony Cummins was very irritable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips and took a deep breath. &ldquo;What do you want before you&rsquo;ll tell me where my mother&rsquo;s grave has been moved?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Such an unfilial daughter. Are you begging me now? Back then, I told you not to seduce Brian to avoid hurting your sister&rsquo;s relationship, and what did you say? Let me be frank, if you don&rsquo;t have 50 million bucks, don&rsquo;t expect me to reveal the grave&rsquo;s location,&rdquo; Tony Cummins said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He then hung up the call immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace tried to call him again, he declined her call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace rushed down the mountain and went straight to the Cummins family&rsquo;s house. No matter how she rang the bell or knocked on the door, nobody came to open the door for her.</p></div>
