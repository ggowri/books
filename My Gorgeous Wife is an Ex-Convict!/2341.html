        <h1>Chapter 2339</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're just in time for lunch. Think of it as having lunch with me," said Mrs. Weiss. With that said, Mrs. Weiss ordered food without waiting for Kyla to reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dishes were served one by one. Each was exquisite, but Kyla had no appetite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aunt, it doesn't matter whether we have this lunch or not. Just tell me whatever you have to say to me. I don't like beating about the bush," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss suddenly broke into a chuckle. "Well said, Miss Corbyn. You don't like beating about the bush, and neither do I. But you keep beating about the bush, don&rsquo;t you? I thought everything was settled when we were in the hospital. I even thought you were forthright. I felt sorry for you and Martin, but... who knew you would say one thing and do another?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her and said, "Aunt, don't worry. I didn't come to Emerald City to start over with Martin or anything. I just have something to ask of him. Once he agrees, I&rsquo;ll return to Emerald City immediately and won't bother him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss looked at Kyla in doubt. "You have something to ask of him? What's the matter? Are you having financial difficulties? Do you want money? Or do you want something else? If you really didn&rsquo;t want to bother him, wouldn't you have come looking for me instead?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly. "I need Martin Weiss to issue a memorandum of understanding for Jacqueline Bowman. I hope he'll plead for Jacqueline Bowman so that she can get out on probation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss's expression changed as soon as she said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hah, and I was wondering what it could be. It turns out you're just here to plead for your friend! I'm telling you, don't even think about it. Your friend almost killed Martin on the operating table. Martin wouldn&rsquo;t have suffered such injuries if you hadn't trusted her too much and been tricked by her!" Mrs. Weiss was gripped with fear at the thought of nearly losing her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had lost her husband. She could not lose her son too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aunt, let me explain. I no longer consider Jacqueline Bowman as my friend. I'm not pleading for Jacqueline Bowman. It's just that Jacqueline Bowman knows the whereabouts of a friend of mine called Amber Mitchell, and Amber Mitchell might not be doing so well now. Jacqueline Bowman wants to be released in exchange for Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s information. I want to know Amber Mitchell's whereabouts." Otherwise, how could she be willing to let Jacqueline Bowman off so easily?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her explanation did not soothe Mrs. Weiss, who still looked at Kyla coldly. "Are you asking my son to spare the life of a killer who hurt him to find your friend? Kyla, Martin risked his life for you. Do you have any conscience?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry... Aunt, I'm sorry. I know it's unfair to Martin, but Amber Mitchell isn't only my friend but also my and Nelson's savior! She was the one who helped me when I had a difficult labor. She also helped me when I got picked on in prison. Without her, Nelson and I would be dead by now!" Kyla sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss's softened when she heard the mention of Nelson and prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that it was her son's fault that Kyla was sent to prison. That was why Nelson was born in prison. "In that case, I'll find a way to deal with this. We'll get Jacqueline Bowman out on probation first. We'll deal with Jacqueline Bowman again when you find out where Amber Mitchell is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's face lit up at that. Things were in a deadlock with Martin Weiss. It would be great if Mrs. Weiss could help.</p></div>
