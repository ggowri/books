        <h1>Chapter 793</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was stunned immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is he doing? Is he kissing me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was he kissing her? Should he not hate her to the extreme? Why did the kiss seem so eager almost as if he was going to devour all of her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know how long it took, but the kiss was finally over. A sigh escaped from his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Martin Weiss himself did not expect to feel... so satisfied from the kiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I haven&rsquo;t felt this kind of satisfaction in a long time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why... Why this woman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at the person in front of him with mixed feelings as his fingers rubbed her lips, which were slightly reddened and swollen from his kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">More than four years had taken away some of her innocence and made her more gentle. It was easy to seduce a man when she glared at him with her gorgeous eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did she use that look to seduce another man too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he thought of her saying that she could give her life to another man, he immediately got into a very bad mood. 'Had the man kissed her in the same way?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, what the hell are you doing?" Kyla's voice brought him back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was not shy as it had been when he kissed her before. It was as if his kiss meant nothing to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Have I been nothing to this woman for over the past four years?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only found some unspoken feeling spreading in his throat, then a sentence came out of his mouth just like that. "Give birth to a child!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Kyla was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Give me a child," he repeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him blankly, almost thinking she had misheard him! 'Give birth to a child? He's asking me to give him a child?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she told him she was pregnant, he never believed her and even said that she had no right to bear his child. Even if she was pregnant, he would abort the child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now he wants me to give him a child? It's like the ultimate irony!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want a child, you can go to Paisley Daniels. Martin Weiss, have you forgotten that Paisley Daniels is your fianc&eacute;e?" Kyla reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You caused Zoen to miscarry and that harmed her body, making it difficult for her to have another child. Kyla, you owe Zoen this child! You owe it to me too!" Martin Weiss said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Owe? I&rsquo;ve never owed Paisley Daniels anything. Not to mention Martin Weiss! On the contrary, they owe me! They owe me justice and innocence!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Heaven has eyes. Paisley Daniels can't have a baby! Hahaha!" Kyla laughed and looked at Martin Weiss coldly. "You said I have no right to bear your child, so now I'll tell you, I don't want to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did you say?" His long eyes narrowed as if he had not expected such a flat refusal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I don't want to give you a child. I'll never give you another child as long as I live!" she looked at him decidedly and said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Having Nelson is enough. I'll never give birth to another child who&rsquo;s related to him by blood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Never!'</p></div>
