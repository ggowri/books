        <h1>Chapter 533</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm. What, you don't like premieres?" Jason asked rhetorically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, no." She shook her head quickly. The problem was the premiere. It was not what ordinary people could attend, and there would be celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was so...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace managed to keep a lid on her fantasies as she had a mission today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have to take Nelson to class, so I can't go," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes fell on the little one beside Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why does he need you to send him to class?" he asked. There was even a hint of jealousy in his tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla's mother hurt her leg and is having a minor operation this afternoon. Kyla has to go to the hospital to accompany her mother, so I volunteered to send Nelson to class today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Jason frowned a little at this. It seemed the little one standing next to Grace was not used to Jason's gaze, so he leaned closer to Grace, clutching Grace's hand nervously with his little hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace naturally noticed the change in the little one's mood. She immediately stooped down to reassure him, saying, "Don&rsquo;t be scared, Nelson. This uncle is my friend, and he'll like you too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace spoke as slowly as she could, matching her words with sign language to make the little one understand her better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Grace turned to Jason and said, "Be gentle with Nelson and smile more, or he'll be scared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly, she had already expressed his opinion on his behalf. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she did not even notice that she was now speaking to him in a way that she had never done before. He would have been offended if she were a stranger, but since it was her, it did not bother him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He&hellip; Liked the casual way she was talking to him, with less care than usual. It was as if the invisible chasm between them was closing little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I&rsquo;ll do as you say," replied Jason. Then, his face softened. A smile rose from the corners of his mouth as he tried to contain the invisible tension he emitted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson blinked and looked strangely at Jason. It seemed the uncle was less frightening now than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Relieved, Grace stood up and touched the little one's head. "Now, let's send Nelson to class first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason nodded, and the group got into the car. Grace gave the driver the address of the class and the car drove toward its destination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Nelson kept looking at Jason curiously with his black and white eyes. Jason gave the little guy a faint glance and wondered if Grace liked such a little thing. Human offspring were weak and dependent on adults for everything but surprisingly seemed to capture the hearts of some women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like this little one here who had obviously captured Grace's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Grace lowering her head to ask the little one whether he was thirsty or whether he wanted a drink, Jason felt left out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not see anything cute about little children like Nelson, but for Grace, he could look harmless in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What time does his class end?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Until four o 'clock in the afternoon, two hours," answered Grace.</p></div>
