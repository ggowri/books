        <h1>Chapter 2053</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could not give her son much, so this was all she could do for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson also put in the effort to learn. He knew his mother worked hard to pay for his fees here. He also knew that he could only better protect himself, his mother, and his grandmother when he was stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he unexpectedly met a few classmates who previously bullied him in school at the taekwondo training institute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They were in different classes, so they did not run into each other the first few times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Several of them surrounded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I wondered why you look so familiar. It turned out it's you, Nelson Corbyn! You must be proud that you made me quit school!" His eyes were full of malice as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Roy Soto, what do you want?" said Nelson Corbyn as he looked around warily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They were in the changing room. He had stayed back for training today, so he came in late to change his clothes. Other than him, the rest seemed to be on Roy Soto's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His grandmother was waiting for him outside, and there were other adults outside too. He would be safe if he ran outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn thought about as it as he began analyzing the situation in front of him and estimating how quickly he could dash out. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I want to teach you a lesson, of course! Hmph. So what if you have a godmother? I can still beat you up. Why would a deaf person like you learn taekwondo? You'd still be deaf even if you learn it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He spoke arrogantly, and the other boys about his age gradually gathered around Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Roy Soto's family was rich, and Roy Soto had often given them a lot of benefits that included food and drinks. If they did not have enough allowance, Roy Soto would give them dozens of dollars if they asked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For children aged nine to ten, dozens of dollars were not a small amount of money. Sometimes, Roy Soto would even give them hundreds of dollars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Roy Soto was these children's leader.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Roy Soto said, "I'll give ten dollars to any one of you who punches him! When the coach asks, we'll just say we were playing with him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as he said that, the children instantly rushed toward Nelson Corbyn and desperately thrust their fists at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn avoided them and tried to run toward the door, but there were so many of them that he could not get out at all. A fight instantly began.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was waiting outside for her grandson to change and come out when she saw a familiar figure heading this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn froze, not expecting Martin Weiss to show up. A person beside Martin Weiss reported, "One of those who just went in is a boy named Roy Soto who once fought with Little Young Master at school. He also encouraged the whole class to bully him. Later, he was forced to transfer to another school due to pressure from the Reed family and the Stephenson family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How long has it been since the children went in?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's been 15 minutes," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss and his subordinate rushed into the changing room while Mrs. Corbyn was still dumbfounded and in a bit of a shock. After pausing for a while, she ignored the fact that it was the boy&rsquo;s locker room and rushed in.</p></div>
