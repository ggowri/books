        <h1>Chapter 3538</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper felt like she was being treated like a panda, so she couldn't help but mutter to William, "How long do you think it will take for us to stop being watched like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you mind?" William asked in response. "I thought you were already used to it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I wasn't with you, even if I was being watched, it wouldn't be this exaggerated," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just a momentary novelty. After a while, it won't be so exaggerated," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they talked, they walked towards the school cafeteria.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived, William asked Jasper to sit down while he went to queue for food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper rested her chin on her hands and watched William queuing not far away. She rarely saw him on campus before, and even when she did, it was mostly through video calls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, they were both attending the same school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, someone walked up to Jasper and struck up a conversation, "Hey, new face! Are you a freshman? What's your name? Let's get to know each other. You probably haven't joined any clubs yet, how about joining the tennis club? I'm the star player there..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person started talking non-stop, while Jasper looked interested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Jasper's reaction, the other person became even more excited and talked even more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a voice suddenly spoke up, "Jasper, who is he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know, but was he trying to hit on me just now?" Jasper asked curiously. After all, whenever she entered the school, everyone knew who she was, and no one would come up to her and talk non-stop like this senior did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William stared at the senior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy's expression immediately became awkward and he cleared his throat, "I was just introducing the club to the freshman, sorry to disturb you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he quickly stepped aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being stared at like that just now made him feel scared, as if he might end up in a terrible situation if he continued to show interest in the freshman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked straight at William, as if studying something, as he watched the senior run away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you were staring at the senior just now, it gave me a creepy feeling," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Creepy?" He furrowed his brows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, it's like he has a grudge against you or something. I never noticed it before, but sometimes when you stare at people, it gives off that kind of vibe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was because that senior had feelings for Jasper, that's why he acted that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will never make you feel that way, so please don't think I'm creepy, okay?" William looked at the person in front of him and his tone had a hint of pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper smiled carelessly, "How could I possibly find you scary! Even if you were scary, it would only be towards others!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she began to eat the food he had just bought, "I'm so hungry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eat slower, don't choke," he said, looking at her with an indulgent expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know!" she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, William's body stiffened suddenly, and he looked around at his surroundings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Jasper noticed William's unusual behavior and followed his gaze, looking around but didn't see anything special.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, I'm probably just being too sensitive." William said. He had a feeling of being watched, as if someone was hiding in the shadows, observing everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even if someone was really hiding and watching, it didn't seem like a big deal. After all, it was just the beginning of the school year and walking around the campus with Jasper always attracted attention.</p></div>
