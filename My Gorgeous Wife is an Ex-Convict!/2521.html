        <h1>Chapter 2519</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not seek justice for Sandra Lucas's death over the years. Instead, he used the illicit fortune to improve his life. How much family affection would he have now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would he give up part of his fortune or even get into trouble with the authorities for a sister who had been dead for years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's heart sank instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, she noticed from the glass panel in front of her that someone was staring at her in a corner not far behind her. She seemed to have seen this person... around George Gregory before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Amber Mitchell suddenly shuddered and turned around, only to find ordinary patients, their families, and medical staff behind her. She did not see the person she had just seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm... being followed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did George Gregory send someone to follow me?' Amber Mitchell's heart sank. If she had entered Stan Lucas's ward and talked to Stan Lucas just now, George Gregory would have known that she came to the hospital for Stan Lucas!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps George Gregory would bribe Stan Lucas like how he bribed those doctors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Amber Mitchell pretended to be looking for a ward. She continued walking and lingered in front of another ward. Finally, she went to the nurses' station, made up a name, and asked if the patient had checked in. After receiving a negative answer, she left the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's eyes showed a touch of confusion after hearing his subordinates report Amber Mitchell's whereabouts. 'Did she come to the hospital to see a patient? But the patient she&rsquo;s looking for isn't here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be a coincidence? Or is there something else I don't know?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell called Brian after leaving the hospital. Brian had given her his contact information, stating he would help her whenever she needed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to ask the Moss family for help with the matter regarding Stan Lucas, but George Gregory probably had his eyes on the Moss family too if he had even sent someone to follow her. Brian was not deeply involved with them and was an outsider. George Gregory's men would probably not keep an eye on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, George Gregory would not be able to find out much about Brian for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call got through, Amber Mitchell said what she wanted. "Mr. Hart, I can email you the details. I wonder if you can help me? Stan Lucas is probably the only solid witness who can confirm that Louise Mitchell's guilty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian readily replied, "Okay, I'll help you. I'll get you the results as soon as possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," Amber Mitchell said gratefully. Of course, she knew very well that Brian was willing to help her only because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, she felt like she was looking at Herman when seeing Brian. Although it was a hopeless relationship, he still tried his best to make the person he liked happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such relationships were precious, but she did not understand them at that time. Now that she had, Herman was already gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What about Brian? Is his love life going to be like this for the rest of his life? Or will he one day meet a woman who&rsquo;s worthy of his affections and who&rsquo;ll return his affections?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It would be such a pity if that man's love life is going to be like this for the rest of his life.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was staring darkly at her hand in the detention center. She still could not move her right middle finger because George Gregory had broken it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell crooned, "George, don't let me down! I'm waiting for you to get me out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Simon was seriously ill, it would be best if he died! She could find another way to get another child anyway, and that child would not have traces of Amber Mitchell in them!</p></div>
