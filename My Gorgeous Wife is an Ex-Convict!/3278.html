        <h1>Chapter 3276</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the women he dated in the past were mostly female celebrities in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some who broke up peacefully naturally relied on the resources given by their ex-partner, had a period of fame, and now live well. However, some who did not break up peacefully are lonely in the entertainment industry and have returned to being ordinary people, but they cannot make much of a splash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, even so, Brian still keeps an eye on some of his ex-girlfriends who are currently not in a good life situation, just in case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Hadwin's cautionary tale was right in front of him, and he couldn't afford to make any mistakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Valda's due date is still far away, Brian has already started selecting the medical staff who will be present when she gives birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He conducts a thorough background check on each one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is completely unaware of all of this. Nowadays, she is focused on being a mother, drawing work-related cartoons every day, and then reading parenting books or shopping online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her workplace gradually shifted from the studio to the villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian created a room in the villa, which is over 100 square meters, as her studio. Her two assistants also come to the villa to work when needed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda really liked the studio that Brian had carefully set up. If she wasn't pregnant, she probably would have just tackled him and offered herself to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the days went by, Valda's morning sickness gradually decreased, and her belly slowly began to grow, no longer flat like it was before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Until her belly swelled, she didn't truly feel the sensation of carrying a little life inside of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the afternoon, Valda sat on the couch, looking down at her belly lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Brian asked as he walked over and saw her lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda regained her senses and looked at Brian, saying, "I was just thinking, we don't know if our child is a boy or a girl."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She is now four months pregnant. In theory, they could find out the gender of the baby, but they haven't made a deliberate effort to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to know?" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm kind of curious, but I also want to keep some mystery. I'll wait until the baby is born to find out," said Valda. "Actually, sometimes I think it would be nice to have triplets like Grace did, with both a boy and a girl."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian frowned, "Where is it good? I don't think it's good at all. It's too dangerous," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda stuck out her tongue and said, "I'm actually satisfied because I can give birth to twins." However, it's clear that her dream of having twins is impossible now. She's carrying a single fetus in this pregnancy, so she may have to wait for the next one to fulfill her dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes darkened slightly, her unintentional sticking out of her tongue just now was like a silent temptation to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I actually think that having a single child is still the best option. Having twins is more dangerous for you," he said, his voice starting to become hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wonder who our child will look like when they grow up. Regardless of whether it's a boy or a girl, it would be more advantageous if they resemble you." Valda kept her head down, staring at her belly, and began to imagine what their baby would look like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it worth it?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly, you're so good-looking. If the child looks like you, whether it's a boy or a girl, they will be very good-looking!" She said. She still remembers seeing his childhood photos before. In the photos, he had chubby cheeks and big phoenix eyes, just like a little glutinous rice ball, incredibly cute!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at the photo and regretted not having seen him when he was a child. Otherwise, she would have hugged him tightly and given him a good kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, if they could have a child who looked like him, it would be a way to satisfy that regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? But I think you're beautiful too. I hope our child can be as cute as you," he said softly, his voice becoming hoarse.</p></div>
