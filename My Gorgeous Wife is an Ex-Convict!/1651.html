        <h1>Chapter 1649</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had so many worries and doubts in his mind but could not get solutions to them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, as long as you stay by my side... I won't be in pain..." As he finished speaking, his lips pressed hard against hers as if he wanted to devour her whole being...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, my parents will be calling the police and suing you for kidnapping if you don't let me go. Everything will be too late by then!" Katherine Jackson blurted out after finally seeing Hadwin Stephenson a few days later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had nothing to do but look out of the window every day while she was locked up here. She did not have any communications device. She was going crazy and totally unaware of what was going on outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't worry about that. Your parents are probably too busy to look for you because of the mess the Jackson family is in. I also told them you're staying in my villa now," Hadwin Stephenson said nonchalantly as he sat on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson's expression changed. "What happened to the Jackson family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson gave his subordinate a look, and they picked up the remote control to turn on the TV in the living room. News regarding the Stephenson family immediately appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The more Katherine Jackson watched it, the paler her face became. At the end of the news, her entire face had turned pale and her body was trembling faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Has the Jackson family... been turned upside down in just a few days?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, you're really good!" Katherine Jackson turned her head resentfully and looked at the man in front of her. He put the Jackson family in such a predicament in just a few days. She could imagine just how much Hadwin Stephenson had prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And when did he start planning all this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not notice it at all. This whole time, she thought she had this man under her control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If I'm not smart enough to go against the Jackson family, I'll be the one getting eaten up instead," Hadwin Stephenson said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson pressed her red lips tightly. Moments later, she said through gritted teeth, "You didn't come here just to let me watch the news about the Jackson family, did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You've seen the news. The most crucial problem the Jackson family is facing right now is that your capital chain is about to rupture. You know what consequences it&rsquo;ll bring when that happens. I'm afraid that the Jackson family will be destroyed within a year. Forget about becoming an ordinary person, you'll be worse off than an average person. You&rsquo;ll be burdened with debts you'll never be able to pay off!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson naturally knew Hadwin Stephenson was not trying to scare her. Besides, this man... would make sure the Jackson family had a horrible end!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, the Jackson family was the true mastermind behind the incident five years ago!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They thought he was easier to control just because he was a bastard child, but now... Katherine Jackson greatly regretted her decision!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This man was not a tameable dog but a vengeful wolf!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If the Jackson family's capital chain ruptures, won&rsquo;t you just be able to swallow our properties?!" Katherine Jackson said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There would be an enormous gap between the Jackson and Stephenson families then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "Yes, but I can also lend you money and give you a way out."</p></div>
