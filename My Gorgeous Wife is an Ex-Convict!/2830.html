        <h1>Chapter 2828</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As far as she knew, such charity galas had nothing to do with her. At most, she would only read relevant content online. She never expected an opportunity to attend one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who else was invited?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They also invited the male lead, Gloria," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's it?" Valda Theller blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's it," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gloria was a popular celebrity, so it was reasonable to invite him. However, the other directors, the producer, and the female lead were not invited. Instead, they invited her&mdash;the original author. It was weird. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if seeing her best friend's doubt, Camille Strickland explained, "I think people in tMason Swansonrcle know you're the crown prince's girlfriend, so it's natural that you would be invited to a charity gala like this. "</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was instantly enlightened. "Can I skip it?" After all, she shuddered at the prospect of facing reporters' cameras and questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can ask Brian for his opinion. Attending charity galas will do you some good in terms of networking," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian came to pick up Valda Theller for dinner that evening, Valda Theller asked, "I was invited to Starlight Charity Gala. Do you think I should attend? By the way, do you know about this charity gala? It's&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know about the charity gala. They sent you an invitation?" Brian said thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she nodded. "Gloria and I were the only ones invited."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think? Do you want to attend?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not sure. I think I'm invited because they know I'm your girlfriend. But I'm scared of facing reporters. I'm not good with cameras and questions. At the same time, I've never been to a gala like this before. It seems many big shots in the entertainment industry will be there," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she was somewhat curious about what such an important gala would be like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Attend it, then. No press will film you or ask you questions," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you know?" she asked, surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I'm attending too," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned for a moment before realizing he was the crown prince of the entertainment industry. It seemed normal for him to attend a gala like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's great. It won't be so scary when you're with me!" Valda Theller was relieved. "I should have thought of it. You definitely would&rsquo;ve been invited too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled and said nothing. He was invited but was not interested in attending. He had already rejected it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was now accompanying this woman to a gala he had no interest in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to be... looking forward to it too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll send someone to pick you up and take you to the salon to get styled. You can go earlier to see if they have gowns you like," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. Didn't you give me a gown and jewelry the last time I attended a banquet with you? I'll just wear those," said Valda Theller.</p></div>
