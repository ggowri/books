        <h1>Chapter 866</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The domineering yet lingering kiss reminded Grace of the kiss she had when she was asleep that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It feels so similar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was it really him&hellip; back then? Did he kiss me while I was asleep?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kissed her until she could hardly breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was over, she gasped for air almost instinctively, but he pressed his head against her forehead and murmured in a hoarse voice, "Don't fall in love with Chase Harper, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "Jason, don't you think you're being ridiculous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He broke up with her, but now he was asking her not to like other men?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face immediately darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know how I felt when I sat here watching these videos of her and Chase Harper in the amusement park together?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if jealousy was going to swallow him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he watched her stare at the man while smiling at him and even volunteering to help the man do his tie, he had felt an invisible knife cutting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain was so bad that every breath seemed to be in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Must you like him?" There was a note of coolness in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately trembled. Somehow, she had a feeling that if she said yes, then Jason would really restrain her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With his power and status in Emerald City, it was simply too easy for him to deal with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides... Chase Harper&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to involve the honest and simple man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I don't like him," she muttered the answer dryly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked into her eyes as if he was examining whether her words were true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment, a smile appeared on his lips. "You don't like him? That&rsquo;s great."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you let me go now, Mr. Reed?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Let go&hellip;' His brows furrowed. He did not want to let go of the woman in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Call me &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;," he said suddenly. Whether she called him Mr. Reed or Jason, it sounded so harsh to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her lips and glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haven't you always called me Jason?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That was before. Now that we&rsquo;ve broken up, I shouldn't call you that anymore," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn&rsquo;t you call me Jay before we started dating? Sis?" His breath lightly sprayed on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the word &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; escaped his mouth, her breathing stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sis, Sis!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word once made her feel less lonely, giving her the illusion that she finally had a family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not my brother, are you? I don't think you need to call me &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;, Mr. Reed," she said with a bitter smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You made me call you &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;. What's the matter? You don't want to be held accountable?" His fingers gently stroked her cheek as he pushed the tangled strands of hair on her cheek behind her ear. "You can't just stop being my sis whenever you like."</p></div>
