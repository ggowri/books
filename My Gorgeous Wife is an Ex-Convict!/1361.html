        <h1>Chapter 1360</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Next weekend? Kyla Corbyn hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you busy?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss might bring Nelson to the amusement park next weekend," said Kyla Corbyn. At least, Martin Weiss had promised that he would.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one&rsquo;s face immediately brightened up when he heard this. "Mommy, can Daddy really go to the amusement park with us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's true." Kyla Corbyn gently stroked her son's little head. Seeing her son's joyful expression, she felt that it was worth it even if the last of her dignity had gotten trampled on by Martin Weiss moments earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace noticed the word &lsquo;us&rsquo; and asked Kyla Corbyn in a whisper when she was leaving, "Are you going to the amusement park with Nelson and Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." She nodded. "Nelson said in kindergarten that his dream is to go to the amusement park with Mommy and Daddy. I want to help him realize this dream."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But your health..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just an amusement park. I'm only accompanying him. Nelson will do most of the playing, so it's alright," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, who was a mother-to-be herself, could somehow understand Kyla Corbyn's thoughts now. "Be careful with your health. Call me if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," she replied with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the smile on her face, Grace had no idea what on earth Kyla Corbyn did to make Martin Weiss agree to go to the amusement park with them. It had probably been a difficult task.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was still heavy-hearted when she was back in Reed Residence. After seeing Jason, she hugged him and said. "How about we regularly bring the kids to the amusement park when they're old enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "Why did you suddenly have this idea?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I went to see Kyla today and learned that Nelson's dream is to go to the amusement park with his daddy and mommy. Nelson has never been to the amusement park with his father and mother since he was born. Even if Kyla gives Nelson all her love and even though I think Martin Weiss is a scumbag, it's still important to Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace's hand and gently kissed her fingertips. "We won't be like them!" What he said was like a promise and an oath. "We'll bring the kids to the amusement park every month."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. "Okay, we&rsquo;ll do it every month. You'll be a good daddy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there any reward for the good daddy?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What reward do you want?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you stay with me all day tomorrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's your birthday tomorrow. Of course, I'll stay with you all day." She gently cupped his handsome face and said, "How about this? I'll give you three wishes. As long as I can make them come true, I'll do it. What do you think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes suddenly darkened, and he looked at her somewhat blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You don't like it?" She thought he would be happy with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." His eyelashes fluttered a little, and a smile formed on the corners of his lips as he said, "I like it very much. I'll think about what three wishes I want to make."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was because every wish was so precious to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...&#12288;&#12288;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace opened her eyes the next day, what came into her view was Jason's handsome face.</p></div>
