        <h1>Chapter 1098</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian answered the phone. After listening for a moment, his expression changed. "What did you say? Uncle Russell is missing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. You know as well that he always asks patients to come to the clinic for treatments. He called me out of the blue today and said that he's going out to see a patient. It might take a long time, so he didn&rsquo;t want me to worry. However, I can't get through to him when I call him!" Dr. Russell's wife talked to Brian anxiously on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell and Brian were very close and they saw each other a lot, so the Russell family had Brian's contact information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"See a patient?" Brian narrowed his phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, do you think Uncle Russell was kidnapped because he offended someone?" Mrs. Russell thought pessimistically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian thought the other way around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Grace had not been taken away by Jason, today would have been when she needed to undergo the second treatment for her fingers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it possible? Could it be Jason who took Dr. Russell?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing the phone call with Mrs. Russell, Brian called his staff. "Go and find out who took Dr. Russell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied the staff. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Brian got up and said to Stella, "Stella, I have to go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... they haven't served the food yet," Stella said eagerly. She had finally asked him out for dinner, yet now he was leaving without even taking a bite?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can help yourself later, I'm sorry." Without waiting for Stella to say another word, Brian left in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does Dr. Russell's disappearance have something to do with Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Where in Emerald City is Jason hiding... Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Somehow, I&rsquo;m in fear. It feels like if I don't track Grace down soon, maybe I&rsquo;ll lose that woman forever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe I&rsquo;ll never get another chance to make that woman fall in love with me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm going to find Grace no matter what!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not expect to see Dr. Russell in the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell quipped, "I didn't think I would one day be kidnapped to treat someone's hand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at Grace and then Jason as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Dr. Russell had never met Jason before, he heard the people who brought him here mentioning &lsquo;Mr. Reed&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They made sure he was blindfolded when they brought him here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Apparently, they did not want him to know where he was going.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be a lie if Dr. Russell said he was not shocked after seeing Grace. When she had followed Brian over, he thought she was just a woman Brian had a crush on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was old news that rich boys would fall in love with poor girls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just did not expect to see Grace in an old mansion today and standing next to such a threatening man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if the man was just standing idly by and looking over lightly, he exuded an intense tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell could naturally see that such a man was probably someone who had occupied a leading position for a long time. Ordinary people had no way to have an imposing manner like that even if they wanted to.</p></div>
