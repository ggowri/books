        <h1>Chapter 1238</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason snorted coldly and was about to attack Brian when Grace suddenly grabbed Jason's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You can't bear it?" said Jason as he raised his eyebrows. His peach blossom eyes were cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He saved the babies and me!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glinted before withdrawing his hand. Grace solemnly said to Brian, "If I tell you yes, will you refuse to believe me like last time or will you choose to believe me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly quivered. "So, you're really her, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Once, a little girl met a little boy who had escaped after getting kidnapped. The little girl wanted to take the little boy to a safe place. They were in the forest for a day and a night where they encountered a lot of danger. In the end, they walked out of the forest together without leaving neither one behind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not answer him directly but spoke as if she was telling a story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian listened with a pale face even though a voice inside him kept saying, 'Stop it... Stop it...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he still stood where he was, taking every word she said into his ears and heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The little boy hurt his leg, so the little girl took the little boy to the hospital. The little boy then told the little girl he'd find her. The little girl gave the little boy a bracelet, and they agreed to use it as a token. It was because she was afraid the little boy would come too late and they would no longer be able to recognize each other after growing up. At least with the bracelet, they could still recognize each other.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only felt as if his breathing had become more difficult, and his heart throbbed with pain. 'It's her. It must be her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was just what he had imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I was already attracted to her back then, but why couldn&rsquo;t I recognize her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why? Why? Why did I miss her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Countless whys flashed across his mind. In the end, he only said one sentence. "Why did you choose not to reveal your identity when you know I've been looking for you?" The clear voice sobbed hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"After the little girl sent the little boy to the hospital, she went home and developed a high fever. There was no good medical care in the small town, so the girl went to Emerald City for treatment. The fever subsided, but her memory was impaired. She forgot the things that happened a few days before she caught that fever, and that naturally included the memories she had of the little boy," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was guilty toward Brian. After all, even if she had unintentionally hidden her identity from Brian in the beginning, her actions afterward were deliberate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you&rsquo;re talking about this now, you remember what happened back then, don't you? Since you remember now, why didn't you tell me? Why did you only tell me after Chase Harper's case happened?" Brian growled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because..." Grace paused. What she finally said was, "Because I thought it was unnecessary. After all, I don't love you. If I told you I was the little girl, you might pay more attention to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Unnecessary..." Brian suddenly laughed, but his eyes were wet. "So it was unnecessary for me to keep my promise and look for you for so many years... So you knew I was looking for you but watched me being deceived like a fool?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip with her teeth. "I&rsquo;m sorry." It was probably all she could say now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She owed him too much for this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had recovered her memory and knew she was the one he had been looking for, but she said nothing for selfish reasons. Now, it was too late.</p></div>
