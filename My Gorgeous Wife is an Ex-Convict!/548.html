        <h1>Chapter 547</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it all turned out to be excessive expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After playing for about half an hour, Grace looked at the time and saw that it was about time to send Nelson back. She took the little one by the hand and got back to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're done?" asked Jason as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Pretty much. If we don't send Nelson back now, Kyla will be worried," said Grace. Then, she looked at Nelson whose face was red. She signed and spoke, "Does Nelson like it here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one nodded his head vigorously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then, I'll take you here again next time," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one nodded again. He grinned at Grace, wrapping his arms around her waist while his small head rubbed against her stomach to show affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason could not help frowning. He raised his hand, lifting the little one straight from Grace's side. He placed Nelson on the other side. "Let's go, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not like anyone getting too intimate with Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know whether to laugh or cry at Jason's actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting in the car, Nelson, who was tired, began to yawn and soon fell asleep while leaning against Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the little one's innocent sleeping face and could not help saying, "Nelson&rsquo;s so cute. If only he hadn't lost his hearing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Cute?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glanced at Nelson who was asleep. To him, were all children not alike? There was nothing cute or not cute about them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson might be uncomfortable sleeping like this. Why don't you help me move him? I'll hold his shoulders while you help me lift his foot carefully," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace began to command Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows a little and looked at her. However, he did not counter her and did what she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only person in the world who could command him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, move softly and slowly. You'll wake him up if you're too fast," said Grace with her voice lowered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver in front used almost all his willpower to stop his hands from trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Well... Who dared to talk to Young Master Reed like that, giving him orders and commands? If it was someone else, they would be thrown to the streets in a heartbeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only Miss Cummins whom Young Master Reed would indulge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The commands at the back continued to ring while the driver's admiration for Grace soared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car pulled up in front of the small restaurant. Grace got out, intending to carry Nelson who was still sound asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Allow me," said Jason as he stretched out his arms to pick Nelson up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they entered the small restaurant, Kyla was stunned to see Jason holding her son.</p></div>
