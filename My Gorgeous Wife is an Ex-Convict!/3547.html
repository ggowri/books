        <h1>Chapter 3545</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The afternoon after Jasper's second class ended, she came to the library to find some books and materials. As she sat in her chair looking at the materials, she caught a glimpse of a figure out of the corner of her eye. The figure was carrying a stack of books and sat down in a nearby seat, flipping through the pages and taking notes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is... Roger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper immediately recognized the person. They were separated by a few tables, but her gaze kept drifting towards him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It really looks like... like Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he really is Lawrence, that would be amazing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Last night, as soon as she closed her eyes, she could hear him playing the Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her eyes met with a pair of deep, beautiful black eyes. Jasper was taken aback as she realized that Roger had lifted his head and was looking directly at her. Their gazes locked!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was she caught peeking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's heart raced, but she didn't look away. She continued to stare straight at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, his eyelashes trembled slightly, and he lowered his gaze. He gathered his books and materials, stood up, and walked towards the library door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Almost instinctively, Jasper followed him out. By the time she snapped out of it, she was already walking behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What caught her eye was his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Broad shoulders, narrow waist, and a straight spine, but his walking posture was casual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was quite tall, around 180 centimeters, just like William. She used to wonder what Lawrence would look like and how tall he would be when she found him, not as a 10-year-old child anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Roger, who was walking in front, suddenly stopped. Jasper was lost in thought and bumped into his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ouch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She covered her nose and staggered back a few steps, while he turned around and his gaze fell on her. "You've been following me all the way, is there something you need?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Jasper was taken aback. Her following him seemed like an unconscious action, and she didn't even think much about it when she chased him out of the library.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If there's nothing, I hope you won't follow me like this again," Roger said, turning around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait!" She suddenly took two quick steps forward and blocked his way. "I followed you because you look a lot like a friend of mine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, he furrowed his brow. "Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know him?" She was surprised.</p></div>
