        <h1>Chapter 2472</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her pale face and her bandaged forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why am I thinking about her? I don't have feelings for that woman anymore! Louise Mitchell is my wife!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory closed his eyes and suddenly became proactive as though he was trying to get rid of the distracting thoughts in his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I love him. I love Herman. I only hate myself for loving him so late." Amber Mitchell's voice echoed in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like a spell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory suddenly opened his eyes and stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George, what's wrong?" Louise Mitchell asked as she opened her eyes with a blank expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I still have some things to deal with in the study. You should go ahead and sleep first," George Gregory said as he pushed Louise Mitchell away and walked to the room door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell shouted, "George! Why... won't you touch me? Do you care so much about Amber Mitchell? You even visited her in the hospital at a time like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory suddenly stopped and turned to look at Louise Mitchell. His sharp gaze made Louise Mitchell wince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know I went to the hospital today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I only heard it from someone at the hospital," Louise Mitchell replied awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that the Mitchell family has eyes at the hospital too, but I advise you not to cause any trouble. If anything happens to Amber Mitchell, the Mitchell family will be the first party to be blamed. The Gregory family will also be involved. The best thing you can do is pray that she's safe until the day of the consultation," George Gregory said without mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell bit her red lip. "Do you care so much about her safety? You&rsquo;re worried about her, but she might not be worried about you. She even went to the Moss family's cemetery in the middle of the night last night. It&rsquo;s obvious enough why she went there! All she has in her heart is Herman Moss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">the Moss family had disallowed everyone from leaking what had happened at the Moss family's cemetery. However, the Mitchell family had sent someone to watch the Moss family&rsquo;s movements these days, so they naturally got wind of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's face became extremely gloomy. "If you mention Herman Moss again, you can just get the f*ck out of this house!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell bit her lip hard and said nothing more in the end. She could only watch George Gregory leave the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fists were clenched as her nails pricked her palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George had always had Amber Mitchell in his heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would never be happy as long as she did not get rid of Amber Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The day of the consultation finally arrived two days later. Amber Mitchell was examined by the top psychiatrist in Deer City, and the examination took three days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three days later, the results of the consultation were made public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's mental state was completely normal. Although she was depressed to some extent, she was not suffering from mental illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A medical report was also issued as various old bruises on Amber Mitchell's body had been examined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They could determine that a lot of her wounds were caused in recent years, including bone cracks, fractures, and so on. Her body also had old burns from cigarette butts as well as other injuries...</p></div>
