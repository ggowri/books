        <h1>Chapter 3718</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were misty, and tears quickly filled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica...he called her Veronica again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, she could hear this name every day and night. When the day came that she couldn't hear it from this person's mouth anymore, she realized how precious it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, if there really is such a day, you don't have to let me off the hook." She choked out, tears streaming down her face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and him, they really started like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Veronica, it was like a dream come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, Mason would occasionally come to her place to rest for a while. Sometimes, he would take a nap on her bed or sofa. Sometimes, they would sit together in the living room and watch TV dramas. On weekends, he would stay with her in this old house for a whole day. She would cook, and he would take the initiative to wash the dishes and tidy up after the meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this made her feel like she had really gone back to the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only difference now is that they hold hands and hug more often, and her state of mind is also different from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where will she and him end up? She doesn't know, the current situation is more like taking it one step at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one thing she is clear about is that she doesn't want to be alone. She wants to hold onto his company, even if it's just a passing fancy, even if it's short-lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps this is the last time she will have a good time with him. Maybe after this period of time, they will continue to be like two intersecting lines, gradually moving away from each other, never touching again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... she still wants to seize this opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming back from the agency, Veronica is exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's already late, past 10 pm. Being a general assistant doesn't pay much, but it's tiring. It's not easy for her to find such a part-time job while still studying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she can get through this difficult time, it will be better after she graduates from college. At that time, she will have more time to spend with Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as this thought flashed through her mind, she immediately laughed at herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still has more than a year before she graduates from college. By then, she and Mason may have already ended this "trial" period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she really has more time then, she will still be alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walking to the door, she enters the password and opens it, only to be greeted by a brightly lit room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She is surprised, did he come?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, she soon sees a familiar figure lying on the sofa, taking a nap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica unconsciously tiptoes to the sofa, gently closes the door, and looks at the man who is resting with his head on a pillow and his eyes closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he's asleep, he loses that cold indifference and gains a bit of youthful innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He... is actually two years younger than her! Veronica thought to herself. Although he's tall and his pretty face often appears expressionless, making him seem more mature than his actual age of 18, he's still just a teenage boy at the end of the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he wasn't covered with anything, she decided to get a thin blanket to cover him. But just as she was about to turn around, a hand suddenly grabbed her wrist.</span></p></div>
