        <h1>Chapter 3088</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille said, "Okay, then I will definitely accompany you to look at houses and also keep an eye out for any suitable ones. When you bring your godmother to Emerald City, I must thank her for saving my best friend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Camille left, Valda looked at her desk in the living room and the comic tools on it. For her, who hadn't touched a paintbrush in a year, they had become somewhat unfamiliar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though her hands were intact now after 10 months of being a vegetable, her reactions were probably much worse than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she picked up the paintbrush again, it would be much more difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For her, it wasn't just one leg that was lame, but her whole life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the future, she will need to put in more effort than before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Valda was thinking, the door of the apartment suddenly opened and Brian rushed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, are you really planning to leave me? Is that why you moved all your things from your previous place to mine without even saying a word to me?" Brian rushed to Valda and grabbed her shoulders, questioning her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda frowned slightly and smelled the strong scent of alcohol on him. "Have you been drinking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I was drinking... I went out for a drink..." he said. That's why he didn't answer Camille's call. When he and Patrick came out of the bar, he realized that his phone had somehow turned off. When he turned it back on, he saw Camille's message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And upon returning from his trip, all he saw was a note left by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda... Did I leave early this morning and make you angry? Is that why you only left me a note and left?" Brian asked with a hint of drunkenness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not mad at you," Valda said. "Brian, as I told you yesterday, I want to come back and live alone. That way, I'll feel more comfortable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you feel uncomfortable being with me? Weren't you the one who wanted to be with me before?" He said, bending down and bringing his face close to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His breath, smelling of alcohol, sprayed onto her face, and his phoenix-like eyes were filled with nothing but her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That was in the past, now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you not want to be with me anymore? Is it because I'm not good enough? Or is it because you feel like you don't deserve me?" Brian asked, his gaze falling on Valda's right leg, which was hidden by her long dress. "Is it because you think you're handicapped and that's why you don't want to be with me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked down, feeling ashamed and embarrassed. She knew that Brian was right. She had been avoiding him because of her own insecurities about her disability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry," she said softly. "I know I've been distant lately. It's not because of you. It's because of me. I just feel like I'm not good enough for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took her hand and looked into her eyes. "Valda, you are more than enough for me. I love you for who you are, not for what you can or can't do. Please don't push me away because of your own doubts and fears."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt a weight lifted off her shoulders as she realized that Brian truly loved her for who she was. She smiled and leaned in for a kiss, grateful for his understanding and acceptance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her. His words directly exposed what she was thinking in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, no matter how many times I say 'I love you', you don't believe me? You don't believe that I truly love you?" He looked at her again, holding her face in his hands, and said in a hoarse voice, "Valda, I love you. What do I have to say or do for you to believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you're drunk. Is your driver downstairs? If not, I can have him come up and help you down." Valda let go of his hand, turned away, and couldn't face him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though a year had passed, Grace still had no resistance towards him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait for me here, I'll go down first..." Her voice suddenly stopped, and the rest of her words seemed to be stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I saw him lower his body and kneel on one knee in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda widened her eyes and only saw Brian's hand gradually lifting the right side of her long skirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wants to... look at her right leg!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No! She doesn't want him to see her ugly right leg again!"</p></div>
