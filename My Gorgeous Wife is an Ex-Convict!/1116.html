        <h1>Chapter 1115</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason just locked you up there? He didn't&hellip; Uh&hellip; Do anything bad to you?" Lina asked gingerly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was relieved. "Then he's still a gentleman after all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina seemed to think of something and said, "By the way, what did you mean when you said you have nothing to do with Jason anymore? You&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Like I said, he's he and I'm me. Even the brother and sister game is over now. He and I are really just strangers," Grace said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina was worried about her calmness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not like Jason. She just thought that Jason had hurt Grace too much, but... Once she knew that Jason and Grace had really become strangers, she had a sour feeling in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina more or less thought that maybe Jason and her best friend still had a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason's not the only man in this world. You'll find someone better." Lina encouraged her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled faintly and did not contradict her best friend's kindness. She knew Lina was worried about her future and that she would end up alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, even if she were to die alone, the idea did not sound that terrible to her. After all, it would be nice to have solitude and not be involved in those complicated relationships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not get hurt and feel pain anymore if she did not love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, what's going on between you and Brian?" Lina thought of this. She remembered how he had still tried to find out Grace's whereabouts after he broke his hand. Lina only felt that her best friend occupied an unusual position in the heart of the entertainment industry's crown prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not keep it a secret and told Lina about her matter with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was the last person in the world she would keep a secret from. She could even give Lina her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was shocked when she heard this. "So that Stella, who trended online several times, is just an impostor who took your place as Brian's savior when he was little?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "That's one way to put it. I didn't think Stella would take my place either. However, I was with Jason and didn't want to get involved with Brian, so I didn't say anything about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now that you're no longer with Jason, why won't you tell him?" Lina asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a wry smile. "I... don't want to owe Brian any more favors."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and Brian had evened the debt. She saved his life once, and he saved her life once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the debt of love was the most difficult to pay off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she did not love Brian, if she told him that she was the one who saved him when he was a child, he would probably be even more reluctant to let her go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of telling him the truth, it was better to continue to keep it as it was. Perhaps his feelings would fade a little when he did not get her response after some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at her best friend but could not give any advice. After all, other people could not interfere when it came to relationships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... "That lucky b*stard, Stella. She has done nothing but gets to live a rich and prosperous life by pretending to be someone else!" It was so infuriating!</p></div>
