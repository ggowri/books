        <h1>Chapter 3766</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper made some "terrifying" sounds and began to chase after the players.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, someone grabbed her hand and pulled her towards another corner room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey? What's going on?" Jasper was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, wait, I...I'm a ghost!" Jasper quickly explained. Was this player stupid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the other person brought her into the room and closed the door behind them. "I know," said the familiar voice in Jasper's ear, causing her to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Lawrence's voice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How...how did you..." Jasper looked up, staring at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lighting in the murder mystery game was intentionally dim, creating a creepy atmosphere. Therefore, the lighting in their room was also dim, and even though they were close, Jasper could only see the outline of his face, but not his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you wondering why I came to play the murder mystery game and brought you, the role player who drives the plot, to this room?" Lawrence asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know why!" Jasper thought to herself, "You're going to get a GAME OVER. Let go of me now, and I'll pretend I never caught you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that you caught me, it's that I caught you," Lawrence said, raising Jasper's wrist that he was holding onto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was exasperated. "You're a player, you can't catch the role player who drives the plot! It's against the rules! Didn't you read the rules before playing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I've always liked breaking the rules," he said. "Now, I've caught you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper broke out in a sweat. "Okay, whether you caught me or I caught you, you should let go first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't let go of her wrist as she had hoped. Instead, he continued to hold it tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him in confusion and twisted her wrist. "Can you let go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really like William?" he asked abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's my boyfriend, of course I like him," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boyfriend? Do you really think he's as innocent as he appears in front of you? How much do you know about his scheming and tactics?" Lawrence said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suddenly laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you laughing at?" Lawrence frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm laughing because in families like ours, no one is really that innocent. Like me, do you think I'm innocent?" Jasper asked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence pursed his lips tightly and didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In some ways, maybe I am innocent. At least I haven't been exposed to any dirty or dark sides. But not being exposed doesn't mean I don't know. The world is dangerous, and our family naturally instills some basic principles to prevent us from being fooled and used for money. So, I never thought that being innocent is good, and being scheming and cunning is bad," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence sneered, "You really have a way with words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just the truth. If you're really that innocent and without any tactics, then you would have been swallowed up by the people around you a long time ago because of our family background," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her family had protected her well, it didn't mean she was unaware. Families like theirs, even if they didn't provoke others, others would still try to get close to them because of their family background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone is really innocent and ignorant of the ways of the world, they will only be easily deceived and used by others.</span></p></div>
