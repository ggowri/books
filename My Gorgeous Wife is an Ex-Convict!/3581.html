        <h1>Chapter 3579</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the bathroom, there are two compartments. The outer one has a sink and a full-length mirror, while the inner one is for showering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two compartments are separated by opaque glass sliding doors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper put away his clothes and then left the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After waiting for a while, Veronica finished dressing and came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at Jasper and seemed a bit embarrassed. "I really appreciate your help today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, aren't you in college? How did you become a celebrity assistant?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I'm not really an assistant. I just happened to find a talent agency that offered part-time work doing odd jobs. But today, Angelica's assistant had a sudden stomach ache and couldn't come, so I was pulled in to fill in for her," Veronica explained. However, what happened later was beyond her expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about it, Veronica became worried. With what happened today, she feared that her days ahead would not be easy. If she was really asked to compensate for the dress...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Veronica's concern, Jasper suddenly said, "Veronica, don't worry about tonight. Nothing will happen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback and then said, "Jasper, you're not going to help me pay for the dress, are you? That's too much..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that's the case, how should she make it up to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, no," Jasper quickly interjected. "I just think that today's mishap wasn't your fault, Veronica. It was the person who bumped into you that caused the wine to spill on her dress. If anyone's to blame, it's her. And if she tries to give you trouble, my mom's law firm can help you fight back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica breathed a sigh of relief at his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she looked at Jasper, appearing hesitant to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's on your mind, Veronica? Is there something you want to say?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hesitated for a moment, as if summoning up great courage, and asked, "How is Mason doing now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Same as always, he's abroad most of the time and only comes back once a year during New Year. He stays for a few days and then flies back overseas," Jasper replied. He seemed to have some regret as he continued, "Veronica, you always come to my house to celebrate New Year and pay your respects early on the night before. If you came a day or two later, you could meet Mason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica lowered her eyes and smiled bitterly, saying, "Actually...it's better if we don't meet. To him, I'm already someone who doesn't matter much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person who used to call her "Veronica" all the time was gradually pushed further and further away by her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had buried all their past feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she still held onto Grace. Whenever she was in pain, she would think back to the good times they had together. But when she came back to reality, she would find herself in even more pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could that be?" Jasper asked. "Even if Mason really did hypnotize and forget about your past feelings, he only forgot about the feelings. The things you experienced together are still in his memory. Veronica, if you really want to reconcile with Mason, then..."</p></div>
