        <h1>Chapter 2844</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was relieved when she heard that. "Alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, get prepared for the comic fiesta and come up with your own tagline." Camille Strickland began telling Valda Theller details about the comic fiesta.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Patrick arrived at Brian's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect you to spend 100 million dollars on your girlfriend's portrait yesterday. It seems you're more serious about her than I thought," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced indifferently at his best friend. "Did you come here to tell me that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just wanted to ask you to keep an eye on Phoebe. I'm afraid she'll get hot-headed and do something bad," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want me to keep an eye on her? Didn't you try to talk her out of it? Do you think I would spare her if I&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on her and I find out she did something she shouldn't have done?" Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick laughed drily. "Since I told you to keep an eye on her, you'll minimize the damage as much as you can, of course. It's better than you ruining her after she&rsquo;s done something that can't be undone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not be here if Phoebe Cross were not so stubborn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick continued saying, "We grew up together. She only fell for someone she can't have. Be... considerate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She can't have?' Brian's eyes darkened slightly. He had also fallen for someone he could not have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'll keep an eye on her. I just hope she won&rsquo;t have a lot of funny ideas. Otherwise, I won't go easy on her and the Song family," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick sighed to himself. 'What's with all the trouble?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's leave it at that. I hope she thinks it through herself." As a mutual friend, he could only do so much. "But then again, since you love Valda Theller so much, when are you going to take her to meet your parents? According to my mom, your parents haven't met her yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Later," Brian said indifferently. He would take her to see his parents when he had fallen in love with her. He did not want his parents to be excited over nothing, nor get her involved with things she did not have to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Later?" Patrick raised his eyebrows. "I thought you were planning to marry her already."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Except for Grace, he had never seen Brian take a woman so seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get married?" Brian murmured. He would probably lead a happy life if he married a woman like Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it would be unfair to her if he could not fall for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I ever want to get married, it&rsquo;ll most likely be with Valda Theller," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was on her way back to her apartment when she received a call from Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just got on the bus after leaving the magazine office. I'm heading back to my apartment," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where will you get off the bus?" Brian asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller gave the name of a bus stop, and Brian said, "Wait for me at the bus stop. I&rsquo;ll come and pick you up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh... Okay." She hesitated before responding as she was thinking about the gown she had changed out of this morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to ask him if he had changed her out of the gown yesterday but failed when the words were on the tip of her tongue.</p></div>
