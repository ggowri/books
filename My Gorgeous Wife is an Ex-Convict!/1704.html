        <h1>Chapter 1702</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she was only seven years old, she was noticeably more precocious than other children. There was wariness and vigilance in her eyes when she looked at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew more about self-protection because of what she had faced in life and was not ignorant like regular children her age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Because my child is about Mason's age. I can't help wanting to help Mason when I see that he&rsquo;s hurt. Plus, it's not a difficult task to bring Mason to a doctor," said Grace. She spoke flatly, showing that she had no other intention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little girl was momentarily silent before turning around to look at the little boy who had been following her. It was as if she was hesitating about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy said, "Sis, it doesn't hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if it doesn't hurt, you're still wounded. Aren&rsquo;t you limping around?" said the little girl before looking up and saying to Grace, "aunt Cummins, just give me a minute. I'll be right back to accompany Mason to the hospital with you." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, she spoke to the boy and told him to wait for her at the store&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy's hand gripped the hem of the girl's skirt and he would not let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ci, be a good boy. I'm just going to put my bag away. I'll be right back for you!" The little girl stroked the boy's head to comfort him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, the little boy let go a little reluctantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little girl then ran in the other direction and was soon out of sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said to Grace, "I'll accompany you to the hospital later. I have a car, so it&rsquo;s more convenient. Besides, I have nothing else to do today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace thought about it and said, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"These siblings are an interesting case. The boy was beaten up so badly. I heard from Kyla that they never even went to the hospital. How pitiful," said Lina. However, she deliberately lowered her voice when she said this, lest the little boy heard her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She felt sorry for the siblings after learning about them from Kyla. Lina was an only child with no brothers and sisters, so she envied how close they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy listened to his sister and stood as still as a statue at the store&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace narrowed her eyes and stared at the little one. For some reason, the little one felt familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if she had seen him somewhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it because the child is beautiful? Isn't there a saying that beautiful people are alike?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Why do you keep staring at that child?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just think the family that adopted him is a little strange. They adopted a boy when they already had a son of their own. And it doesn&rsquo;t seem like they adopted him because they like him,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, if they loved the boy, they would not have hit him until they broke a cane.</p></div>
