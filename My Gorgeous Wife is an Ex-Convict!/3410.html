        <h1>Chapter 3408</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as she gets to spend time with Mason, she believes she can also become good friends with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, her family will also rise to the top because of Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has heard people say that Veronica's family was originally just an ordinary family, but because Mason and Veronica were close, Mason was fostered by Veronica's family. As a result, the Barlow family benefited greatly, and the Reed family gave them a lot of money every year!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leyna must be so envious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, when my parents are casually chatting at home, they also talk about this topic. They even said that it would be great if Mason could be fostered in our family, because then he could enjoy the luxury of being picked up and dropped off in fancy cars and living in a big house!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she thought of using the opportunity of performing in the grade to get closer to Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the result was unexpected, Veronica refused so decisively!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just help out a bit, it's for the grade after all!" Leyna continued to persuade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry, if you really want to, you can talk to Mason yourself," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She is now 16 years old, and over the years she has encountered people like Leyna, so she knows very well what the other person is thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Leyna saw that there was no room for improvement in the situation, her face became increasingly unpleasant, and she turned around and walked away with resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she walked away, she muttered angrily, "What's so great about her? She's just a fake older sister. Besides, who knows what kind of relationship she has behind the scenes, even if she calls herself a sister!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face turned pale for a moment. Since starting high school, she has been hearing more and more rumors and gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The high school she attended was not a prestigious one in Emerald City, but rather a regular high school with a good college admission rate. Most of the students here were children of ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And because Mason skipped a grade with her, he also went to high school with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After starting high school, Mason and Grace stuck together just like before. They even had seats arranged next to each other in class.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the gossip in high school is far more abundant and harsher than in middle school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people behind her back say that she is in an early relationship with Mason, and some even go so far as to say that they have engaged in inappropriate activities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that these were just automatically filtering out gossip and rumors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason is an important younger brother and a close relative to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though there is no blood relation between the two, after so many years of being together, they have become a habitual presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica turned around and was about to head back to the classroom when suddenly a ball flew towards her from the direction of the playground and hit her shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She winced in pain and furrowed her brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, a figure rushed up to her and apologized urgently, "I'm sorry, are you okay? Do you need any help?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica frowned and felt a sudden pain in her shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she shook her head and said, "It's nothing, it doesn't matter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was about to leave, the other person suddenly stopped her and threw the ball back, shouting to their teammates on the field, "I'll go with this classmate to the infirmary, you guys keep playing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said to Veronica, "Go to the infirmary and have a look. The force of the ball hitting your shoulder must have hurt you."</p></div>
