        <h1>Chapter 1304</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I care a lot about you. You're my... husband, the father of my children. How could I not care about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You won't care about me if I'm not their father?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately did not know whether to laugh or cry. 'Is he even jealous over the kids?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course... not!" she said at once. Even a fool would have known what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... he was the one she loved, and because she loved him, she loved their children even more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her hand and gently rubbed his head again as she spoke."Alright, I care about Lina and Kyla because they really need help right now. Besides, both of them have helped me a lot, especially Lina... If it hadn't been for her, I probably wouldn't have met you at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I would have died in the cold prison.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason seemed to think of something and his eyes twinkled. "I know Lina is your lifeline, so you'll help her no matter what. But does she even matter more than me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but laugh. "That's incomparable. My feelings for you are all different!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if it has to be compared?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated for a moment before looking at the person in front of her carefully. "Both of you are people I would give up my life for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes darkened immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew more than anyone that she valued her family and friends more than anything. She would be willing to return double the kindness others showed her. Besides, Lina had once given up her future for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had stayed by her side in those three years. Speaking of which, he should thank Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Or at least he should be satisfied that he was no less important to her than Lina. Besides, she said she loved him, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had given him what he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why was he dissatisfied? He was even greedy for more...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, when will you make me your lifeline too?" muttered Jason. In that case, would she need him more? So much so that she could not live without him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During lunch, Jason chose a private room and ordered some sweet and sour dishes according to Grace's taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's preference for food had also changed since she became pregnant. She now enjoyed sweet and sour dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh, you can order something else too. You don't have to completely cater to my taste," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said with a slight smile, "I&rsquo;m not. You're pregnant, yet I can't help you share the burden. I can at least share a little of your experience by eating the same food as you. It makes me feel like I'm accompanying you through this pregnancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but smile at that. He was probably the only one who could think of such an explanation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The food at the restaurant was pretty good. It gave Grace quite the appetite.</p></div>
