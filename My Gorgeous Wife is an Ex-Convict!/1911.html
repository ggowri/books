        <h1>Chapter 1909</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hence, punch after punch landed on Grace's body. However, she only focused on protecting her best friend's stomach from those punches!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had no idea how many punches she received.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace kept telling herself to hold on and Jay would save her. He would!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">No matter how furious he was with her, he would show up whenever she was in danger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She just needed to hold on a little longer. A little longer...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though she was saying this to herself, her mind began to be hazy due to the physical pain. Several times, she nearly fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the punches stopped landing on her body. She heard loud gusts of wind...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the sound of helicopter propellers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked up in disbelief at the sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There were five helicopters in the sky, hovering above the top floor of the building. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Staring blankly at the helicopters, Grace suddenly had a feeling that they must have something to do with Jason. 'It must be Jay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Jay has come to save me and Lina!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson had chosen the top floor of an abandoned building. She chose this site as she planned to push Grace and Lina off the roof of the building afterward!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not expect to be surrounded by helicopters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As the helicopter flew lower and lower, the wind from its propellers made it hard to keep their eyes open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson seemed panicked, and the expressions of her men, all of whom looked so ferocious just a moment ago, changed as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One of them glared at Katherine Jackson with a ghastly expression. "Who the hell did you make us kidnap? Didn't you say it was an ordinary rich man's wife and a woman abandoned by your ex-boyfriend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's with these helicopters?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Could an ordinary rich man get five helicopters to circle them like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before Katherine Jackson could speak, Grace said, "The person she asked you to kidnap is the wife of Jason, the richest man in Emerald City. Didn't you do your homework beforehand? Or maybe she was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t help her if she had told you the truth?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The men's faces darkened, and Katherine Jackson growled. "Grace, shut up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace ignored Katherine Jackson and said to the men, "It's not too late for you to stop. Katherine Jackson only paid you to help her. So as long as you stop now, I can forgive and forget. I&rsquo;ll even promise not to pursue you and double your pay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knew the most important thing now was to get these mercenaries on her side. Katherine Jackson could not do anything if they were willing to stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The men looked at each other, contemplating the possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Will you really promise not to pursue us and double our pay?" asked one of the men who had punched Grace and Lina earlier.</p></div>
