        <h1>Chapter 1823</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson looked coldly at Hadwin Stephenson who was in pain. Even though the man who made her a laughing stock and ruined the Jackson family was in so much pain at this moment, she did not feel happy about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she felt was loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The man was willing to endure this inhuman pain because of Lina! This blood curse was only against Lina. If he had been willing to choose any other woman in the world, he would not have to endure the pain of lifting the blood curse. However, he would rather risk death so that he could be with Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What about her? All these years had been for nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What's so good about Lina that a man like Hadwin Stephenson would do so much for her? The woman's plain and ordinary. She never did anything special, did she?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, is Lina worth suffering for? She doesn't even know you're suffering!" Katherine Jackson walked up to Hadwin Stephenson, crouched down, and said, "If you can't make it through tonight, you&rsquo;ll die. Even if you die, she probably won't shed a tear for you. She'll always think of you as the man who abandoned her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if triggering him in this way would make her feel better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson raised his head with difficulty due to the pain. His eyes seemed dazed, but he was still gasping. He said with an extremely hoarse voice, "If I... die, the Jackson family... can't live either. I don't need you to judge... how much I... suffer for Lina..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As long as it was for Lina, why would it not be worth it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was already his everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had no idea how long she stayed in the car. She only saw the sky brighten up, and her heart sank until it reached the deep bottomless abyss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is it... dawn?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson had spent the night in his mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson and Katherine Jackson spent the night in the mansion while she and the baby in her belly stayed outside all night!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Finally, the mansion&rsquo;s gate opened. Lina saw Katherine Jackson come out. She was still wearing the clothes from last night and looked tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guard at the gate helped Katherine Jackson drive her car over and watched her leave respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Katherine Jackson drove by Lina's car, Katherine Jackson's eyes met Lina's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Surprise flickered in Katherine Jackson's eyes, but a smile soon appeared on the corners of her lips. It was as if she was glancing at Lina contemptuously before she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina just thought her chest felt stuffy. The look in Katherine Jackson's eyes seemed to confirm her speculation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She picked up her phone, wanting to call Hadwin Stephenson. However, the moment she picked up her phone, she paused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What's there to ask? What else is there to ask? Katherine Jackson coming out from Hadwin Stephenson's mansion at this hour is already the best proof.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is this the important thing Hadwin Stephenson wanted to tell me? It's indeed... important!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe she should be glad Katherine Jackson had gone into the mansion first. Otherwise, last night would have been the most embarrassing time of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not too late for her to get her mind back on track. At least she had not put in all of her feelings. At least she could still take them back...</p></div>
