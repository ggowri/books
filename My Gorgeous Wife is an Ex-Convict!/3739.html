        <h1>Chapter 3737</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their seats were not together, with Jasper and William in the fifth row, and Mason and Veronica in the seventh row.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, stop thinking about it," William said to Jasper. "The movie is about to start."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could she not think about it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, what's going on between Mason and Sister Veronica now? Have they made up?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe, at least their relationship doesn't seem bad. Mason doesn't usually go to the movies with anyone," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very rarely," Jasper said. Especially in the years since they separated from Sister Veronica, at least in her impression, Mason had no memory of watching movies with anyone else. "But didn't Mason hypnotize his feelings? And he seemed to dislike </span><span>Sister Veronica before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it was just a disguise for fear," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disguise? Are you saying... Mason is afraid of having feelings for Sister Veronica again?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, Veronica was the person he cared about the most, wasn't she? Hypnosis only fades this feeling, but it doesn't mean it really doesn't exist," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was speechless. Yes, wasn't Sister Veronica the person Mason cared about the most? Even Mason's care for Sister Veronica once exceeded that of his family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can they really make up this time? Can they be together?" Jasper asked. In recent years, she felt that Mason had become colder, as if lacking some kind of living "vitality," as if he was indifferent to everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mason, who used to be with Sister Veronica, looked more like a "person," with a smile on his face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It depends on them," William said. "I have always believed that where there's a will, there's a way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, he held her hand and their fingers intertwined. "So, between us, I also believe that where there's a will, there's a way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed the back of her hand, and Jasper felt her heart beat faster. "This is a movie theater!" she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, it's so dark around here, no one will notice. Besides, even if they do, it doesn't matter, we're boyfriend and girlfriend, aren't we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was like a kind of enchantment, particularly tempting in this dimly lit cinema.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, they were already boyfriend and girlfriend anyway, Jasper thought to himself. And in recent days, their physical contact had become more and more frequent, and she seemed to be getting used to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His embrace, his kisses, all made her feel very comfortable, and she would even ask for them herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quite liked this feeling. Thinking about it, Jasper felt that maybe she could have started dating William a little earlier. I wonder if Mason and Sister Veronica will date in the future?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Veronica and Mason, who were on Jasper's mind, were having a slightly awkward conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want a drink?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want popcorn?" she asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," he replied again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This simple way of talking was not uncomfortable for her, after all, even when they were close before, he often spoke very briefly.</span></p></div>
