        <h1>Chapter 3848</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today's events are..." Veronica was about to explain what happened today to Mason, but he interrupted, "I know what happened. Don't worry, I'll handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was surprised by his words. "You know that these thugs came to me for money because my father owed them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Mason replied. "Money was originally a small matter, but your father and stepmother shouldn't have let these thugs find you and put you in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't sent someone to protect her in secret, the development of today's events would have had a different outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Mason's heart tightened. He would never allow anything to happen to her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So how do you plan to handle it?" Veronica asked, wanting to know his approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Mason said, "Let's see what your father and stepmother have to say first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't indulge them. If they want money, don't give it to them," Veronica said, afraid that he would just give them money to solve her family's troubles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she knew her father and stepmother's greed. If she gave them money this time, then next time, they would only become more ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For so many years, relying on the Reed family, her father and stepmother had developed a habit of wanting to use the Reed family for everything. Even because of her existence, they became more arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when she and Mason broke up, her father and stepmother did not behave any better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because even then, the relationship between the Reed family and her was not completely cut off, and she still had contact with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So her father and stepmother used the name of the Reed family to attract investments and build connections, and some unsuspecting people fell for it. But in the end, they were afraid of offending the Reed family, so they let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she and Mason have reconciled, her father and stepmother will only become more restless, so she thought of cutting off ties with them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only in this way can she stop her father and stepmother from using the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this incident is an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about I talk to my father first, and tell him about my plan to cut off ties with them? As long as I am firm, if they are smart enough, they won't bother me again in the future." Veronica thought for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's eyes narrowed slightly, "But what if they are not smart enough? Sometimes, the greedier people are, the more foolish they become, but they still think they are smart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica fell silent. Yes, her father and stepmother were greedy people. Would they really stop bothering her just because she cut off ties with them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or would they become even more desperate to take everything from her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Veronica felt an invisible pressure weighing down on her, making it hard for her to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, you don't have to see them. I said I will handle it, and everything will go in the direction you want." Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Archer and Rosalind met with Mason at the Barlow family's residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning that the thugs who went to ask for money were beaten up and taken to the police station, they had been on edge all night, afraid that their eldest daughter would encourage Mason to come knocking on their door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But nothing happened all night.</span></p></div>
