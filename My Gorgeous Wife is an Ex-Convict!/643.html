        <h1>Chapter 642</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it?" he asked, raising his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ve a lot of scars on my body, so the wedding dress can only be designed conservatively. If it's too revealing, my scars will be revealed," she said, embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt a throbbing pain in his heart. "A conservative one would be nice. I don't like the idea of my bride wearing a dress that's too revealing." The corners of Jason's mouth raised slightly as he wrapped his arms around Grace before saying, "I wish your wedding dress could cover you from head to toe. You know what? I'm a possessive person, so I can't bear to let others see an inch more of your skin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had initially been embarrassed about this, his words easily made her relieved. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Jason," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not joking, nor am I comforting you," Jason said as he gently rubbed his lips against Grace's cheek. "Even if you have scars on your skin, you're still beautiful enough to make me want to seize all of you. I even want to lock you up on an isolated island where I'm the only one who can see you. That way, I don't have to worry about people taking you away from me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but laugh. &ldquo;Who would want to take me away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his lips together but made no reply. She never knew how appealing she was. She had a special temperament that made people feel comfortable just by being around her. One would be satisfied just by looking at her calm smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That could be a fatal attraction for some people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was probably attracted by that too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was still attracted to her, even though he insisted that she was not the one he was looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, Grace settled on a designer whose work had a conservative, vintage look and suited her needs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had no problem with that either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, will your grandfather approve of our marriage? What if he doesn't agree?" asked Grace with some trepidation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He won&rsquo;t consent to it, but it's our marriage, so it doesn't matter whether he agrees," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's still your grandfather, and if he doesn't agree, then you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't mean anything to me," he interrupted her and said, "Whether the old man agrees, I'll still marry you. I don't think I&rsquo;ll be happy if he agrees or sad if he doesn&rsquo;t."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at Jason, shocked by his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you find it hard to understand?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't he... Your grandfather?" she asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's my grandfather, but we don't have the so-called affection for each other. He has always hated the part in me that carries my mother's blood and genes. What he wants is just an heir of the Reed family. If I'm not strong enough, he&rsquo;ll easily give me up and choose another heir who he thinks can carry forward the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said it as if he was talking about someone else's business as an onlooker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had met Old Master Reed once, but she did not have a good impression of Old Master Reed. She almost got disfigured that time! If Jason had not come in time to save her, she might still be in the hospital right now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect Jason and Old Master Reed to have such a relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was young, his mother left and disappeared, and his father died. He was alone in Reed Residence where his only relative there was Old Master Reed who simply regarded him as a successor who could be replaced at any time.</p></div>
