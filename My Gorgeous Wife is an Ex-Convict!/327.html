        <h1>Chapter 326</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, as the boss, she handled the cashier, served the dishes, cleaned the tables, and seemed to do a little of everything. When the business was busy, she had no time at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her abilities might be limited, but she gave her son the best that she could give.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At about three o'clock, the restaurant received another order, which included pineapple buns and milk tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when Grace saw the address that she was distracted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Is there a problem?" Kyla Corbyn had prepared the order for Grace only to find her staring blankly at the order receipt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing," replied Grace, taking the pineapple buns and milk tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The address of the order was clearly the law firm where she had previously worked at. Now that she was going to deliver food there, she would naturally meet her former colleagues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she was such a splendid person in the office, Perhaps in a moment, she would be very embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a hint of bitterness in her heart, but now that she had chosen this industry, these situations were inevitable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, life was so long that you would always meet people you had known before. Just because she had been to prison and was destitute, could she not face those people?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;I just have to get used to it!' she thought to herself, then put the food on the electric bike and drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The closer she got to the law firm, the more familiar the roads became to her. When Grace came to the law firm's entrance, she parked the electric bike and looked up at the modern building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she first came to this building, she had been in such high spirits that she thought with enough experience, she would one day set up her own firm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now, everything seemed insubstantial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the order and pressed the floor button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace stood in front of the firm's two glass doors, she dialed the number on the order, and out came a young woman who looked like she had just graduated from college. This person was presumably a new hire for the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," she said as she took the order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the receptionist of the firm recognized Grace and suddenly cried, "Hey, isn't this Grace? You..." She glanced at her co-worker's food delivery, then seemed to say in surprise, "Are you delivering food?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The one who collected the food delivery asked the receptionist, "Do you know each other?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, Grace used to work here. She's famous for..." The receptionist stopped in the middle of her sentence. The way she looked at Grace also changed from surprise to sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled and turned to leave. When she walked into the elevator, she caught sight of the receptionist and the new colleague chatting, presumably about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was only glad that she did not see many of her former colleagues today, so it was less awkward for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already past ten o'clock when Grace got back to Reed Residence after a long day's work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to go straight to her room, but she remembered what Jason had said earlier, so she knocked on his door as she passed Jason's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since he wanted her to bid good night, so be it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the door opened and Jason stood by the door, looking at Grace. "You're back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Well... Good night," she said, turning to go back to her room.</p></div>
