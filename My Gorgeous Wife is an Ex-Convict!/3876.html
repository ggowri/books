        <h1>Chapter 3874</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pursed her lips, hesitating a bit before saying, "I'm at the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Mason's voice changed noticeably. "Why are you at the hospital? Are you injured?! Where are you hurt? Is it serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A series of questions exploded on the other end of the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica awkwardly said, "I'm not injured... it's just that there's something going on, so I came to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just a routine blood test to see if... um, if I'm pregnant," her voice grew quieter as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the results haven't come out yet, so it's uncertain whether she's pregnant or not. She's just a week late for her period.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And in the past, her period has been delayed for up to two weeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, there was silence on the other end of the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason?" Because the silence had lasted too long, Veronica couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Which hospital are you at?" Mason's voice finally rang out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica said the name of the hospital, Mason only said quickly, "Wait for me at the hospital, I'll be right there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Shirley came back with bread and mineral water, she saw Veronica staring at her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason called just now and said he's coming over," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does he know you came to the hospital to check if you're pregnant?" Shirley asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Veronica nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shirley handed the bread and water to her friend, "Have some, your stomach must be empty now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica didn't refuse and started eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, if you are really pregnant, what are you going to do?" Shirley asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will keep it," Veronica said without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If there really was a little life in her belly, giving birth was the natural thing to do. But...Mason had taken precautions, except for that night a month ago when they had sex several times and ran out of condoms for the last two times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be those two times?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it's still uncertain whether she's pregnant or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica was halfway through her bread, Mason arrived. He was a little out of breath, indicating that he had run all the way here after parking his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you get here so fast?" Veronica was surprised. It had only been about ten minutes since he called her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wasn't far from here when I called you," Mason said. "So, have you got the result yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you not eat lunch? Why are you eating bread now?" he asked, glancing at the bread she hadn't finished yet. It was only just after two in the afternoon, so if she had already eaten lunch, she shouldn't be hungry enough to eat bread now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Veronica could answer, Shirley indignantly recounted what had happened at the restaurant at lunchtime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Shirley mentioned how the other person had poured soup directly onto Veronica, Mason's face darkened and he emitted an aura of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Shirley, who had been angry just moments before, could feel the anger emanating from Mason and closed her mouth.</p></div>
