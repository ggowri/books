        <h1>Chapter 2101</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. "It doesn't matter if he loses?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He'll die if he loses, but... If Kyla's indifferent to whether he lives or not, it means he's nothing to Kyla. In that case, it doesn't matter if he lives or dies," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was immediately dumbfounded. It seemed Martin Weiss had won the bet in the end. At least, even if Kyla did not love him anymore, it was not to the point where she did not care about his life or death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was sent to the hospital for emergency treatment. Fortunately, the wounds were not deep. There was only a lot of blood loss. To be on the safe side, 400 ml of blood was transfused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Martin Weiss still held Kyla's hand tightly, refusing to loosen his grip even during the blood transfusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if he was afraid he would lose her if he let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was no other sound in the ward except for the sound of the blood transfusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Jason had also retreated outside, leaving them alone in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at Martin Weiss. "Let go. It's pointless to keep holding me like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just want you to promise me that you won't abort the baby," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Kyla, you can scold me, beat me, and even kill me, but don't give up the baby, okay? You said Chase Harper is innocent and asked me to leave him alone, but what about the baby? The baby is innocent too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla suddenly trembled. After a long while, she finally opened her mouth and said hoarsely, "Okay, I won't abort the baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" He was surprised as his eyes lit up with hope. "Are you willing to keep the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I&rsquo;ll keep the baby. But Martin Weiss, I&rsquo;m not keeping them because of you. It's just because this is an innocent little human life!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes... Yes, I understand. I understand!" Martin Weiss said repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Can you let go now?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss then slowly released his grip. However, he was still reluctant when he let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Kyla walked out of the ward, Grace came up to her. "Kyla, are you okay? What did Martin Weiss&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I promised him I'll keep the baby," Kyla said with exhaustion on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace had no idea if she should breathe a sigh of relief. If Kyla was determined to abort the baby, who knew how Martin Weiss would react?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why don't I take you home now?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car drove to the store. As soon as Kyla reached home, Mrs. Corbyn was shocked to see the bloodstains on her daughter's clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why is there so much blood on you? Where did you hurt yourself? What happened?" Mrs. Corbyn asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said in a tired voice, "Mom, this isn't my blood. It's Martin Weiss's blood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was startled. "His blood? Did you run into him this afternoon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla hesitated for a moment before finally making up her mind and said, "Mom, I'm pregnant, and it's Martin Weiss's!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was instantly dumbfounded. "What... What did you say? You're pregnant?"</p></div>
