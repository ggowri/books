        <h1>Chapter 2517</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you tell me where the patient's family is and I'll return it to them myself?" said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid it's inconvenient for us to disclose their information without their consent," the nurse said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell went silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another nurse put the bag away. Amber Mitchell vaguely heard a voice from the next room. "Hurry and take it to the 12th floor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'12th floor? Is the kid who needs blood on the 12th floor?' Amber Mitchell wondered to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not leave immediately because she had just finished donating her blood. She had to rest for 30 minutes first. She could only leave if there were no adverse symptoms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After 30 minutes passed, Amber Mitchell took the red envelope and left the blood-drawing room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was only one 12-story building dedicated to the inpatient department in this hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Amber Mitchell went to the inpatient department and took the elevator. She intended to check with the nurses' station on the 12th floor to see if she could find the patient's family and return them the red envelope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after she got to the 12th floor, she ran into George Gregory coming out of the doctor's office when she was walking through the corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was accompanied by several doctors, who seemed to be talking to him while walking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory, the transfusion is only to handle the emergency. It's safer to transfuse the child with his mother&rsquo;s blood. Blood from a biological mother is the most acceptable to a child," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's expression was cold. Louise Mitchell's release would take some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the soonest, it would take a month. If it took a little longer...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, Simon would probably have to suffer many more times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he had little affection for Louise Mitchell and would not pity her tragic end, he did have affection for his only son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some reason, he felt something every time it came to his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he would save Simon at any cost. Even if Louise Mitchell were guilty, he would get her acquitted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if suddenly sensing something, George Gregory stopped abruptly and looked in Amber Mitchell's direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He froze upon seeing Amber Mitchell's figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not expect to meet her in such a place!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could not help squinting when his eyes fell on the red envelope she was holding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The red envelope... If his eyes did not deceive him, he had sent someone to give it to the four people who donated blood to Simon as an expression of gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why was Amber Mitchell holding the red envelope in her hand? Could it be that...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory walked over to Amber Mitchell, stared at her, and asked, "What's the matter? Did you donate blood today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell froze before staring at the red envelope, then George Gregory. After a moment, she remembered what she had heard before. "Is the child who needs a full-body blood transfusion today yours?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, do you regret it? You probably wouldn't have volunteered to donate blood if you had known it was my child," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had heard from his doctor that a non-hospital worker happened to hear that a child needed type-B blood and offered to donate without even knowing the child's identity.</p></div>
