        <h1>Chapter 2970</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Valda and Brian sat down, the elderly Mrs. Hart turned to Valda and said, "You draw comics quite well. I personally admire girls who have a special skill. As the saying goes, if you have a skill, you won't have to worry about anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not at all, not at all. I just used to enjoy drawing before, and now I happen to be able to make a career out of it," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Pretty good," said Mrs. Hart, but then she changed the subject. "Is it true what Brian said, that you and he are back together now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda tensed up, knowing that the crucial point had arrived. "It's true."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because he took a stab for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's because I love him," Valda said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It's strange to say, but normally if she said this in front of others, she might feel embarrassed. But at this moment, she is just being honest and saying everything clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you break up again in the future?" asked Mrs. Hart again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's body stiffened imperceptibly, and a hint of unease flickered in his eyes, as if he was afraid of her answer, which might be something he didn't want to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda replied, "I won't break up with him unless I'm sure he doesn't love me anymore. Otherwise, it's a no-go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have any plans to marry my son?" asked Mrs. Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda almost choked on her own saliva, this question... it's jumping too quickly, isn't it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not just planning to play around, are you?" The old Mrs. Hart furrowed her brow as she looked at Valda, who didn't answer right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, no, I... of course, I have plans to get married," Valda quickly clarified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Hart's brow relaxed, "When?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." This...this is too direct. They have only met twice, including the time at the hospital. Is it normal for parents to ask such a question after meeting only twice?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mum, Valda and I have just started again. Don't you think it's too early to ask that?" Brian helped Valda out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good morning? I feel like it's already too late. Look at all my sisters around me, who doesn't have grandchildren? And me...forget about grandchildren, I haven't even seen the shadow of a daughter-in-law!" grumbled Mrs. Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart quickly comforted his wife while Brian said, "If Valda and I get married one day, it won't be for the sake of having children or continuing the family line. We'll only do it because she's the person I want to marry, and I'm the person she wants to marry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You--" Mrs. Hart suddenly found herself speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda suddenly felt touched in her heart. She understood that Brian's words were meant to not put any pressure on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, then tomorrow night, let's have dinner together. It'll be a formal meeting!" said Mrs. Hart. "That shouldn't be a problem, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Valda and asked, "Are you free tomorrow night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I am, I am!" Valda quickly replied. Even if she wasn't free, she would make time for this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, when you finish work tomorrow, I'll come to your studio to pick you up," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing their discussion, Mr. and Mrs. Hart were about to leave. Before leaving, Mrs. Hart reminded Valda, "Valda, my son is a bit introverted. You have to work hard. I'm counting on you to give me grandchildren in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda blushed at her words.</p></div>
