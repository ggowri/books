        <h1>Chapter 4403: Do You Like Me?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his embarrassed look, Harley was thinking about not teasing him anymore. But when she accidentally glanced at his crotch, she also felt a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she didn't understand anything else, she knew... he was... reacting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor did mention that there are still remnants of the medication in his system, making his body more sensitive than usual, and therefore more prone to reactions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But isn't this a bit... too fast for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like he noticed her gaze. Calvert's face turned so red it looked like it was about to bleed. He desperately tugged at the hem of his clothes, trying to use it as a cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And from his mouth, came endless apologies, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I... I didn't mean to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." Harley was at a loss for words for a moment. It seemed like she should be the one saying sorry, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't deliberately teased him with her words just now, he probably wouldn't be in this physical state!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, his flushed face, paired with those black eyes shimmering with moisture, she found him incredibly attractive, so much so that she couldn't tear her gaze away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Harley silent, Calvert became even more flustered, fearing she was truly angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley, you... you can yell at me, or even hit me, whatever you want, I know... I shouldn't have... I... I really didn't expect my body to... I... I promise I won't do it again!" He rambled on incoherently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stared at Calvert, suddenly asking, "Do you like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's body suddenly became incredibly stiff. His eyes, looking at her, were like those of a startled deer, brimming with moisture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you mean, not the kind of liking between friends, but the romantic kind?" Harley asked, being even more straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was incredibly nervous, feeling that this answer would impact the future. He thought maybe he should use some excuse to vaguely get by, but he didn't want to deceive her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, after he truly expresses his feelings to her, would he even lose his last bit of hope?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she's such a wonderful person, with a great family background, beautiful looks, and a pleasant personality. There are plenty of people who like her. After he told the truth, he was simply rejected by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just... rejection, it's just that he was rejected a bit earlier than expected. As long as he acts like it's no big deal and accepts it, he should still be able to continue being her friend, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wrestling with his feelings. After a while, he finally said, "Yes, I like you. It's the kind of liking between a man and a woman. I... I know I'm not good enough for you, but... I'm trying. I hope that one day, I can stand by your side. It's okay if you... reject me. I'm mentally prepared for it. It won't upset me. So, you can reject me now if you want..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert hung his head, mumbling incoherently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would you really not be upset if I turned you down?" Harley's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... No, I won't." His voice trembled slightly as he responded. Despite the fact that he would be heartbroken, even desperate... But hadn't he been mentally preparing himself for this over the years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just a kid from a low-income family, with a mother who ran away and a father who was an alcoholic. Even though he had made some progress in the past couple of years, when compared to her, the difference was like night and day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Between them, there was a world of difference. It was only natural that he would be rejected!</span></p></div>
