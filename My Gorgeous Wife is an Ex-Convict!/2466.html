        <h1>Chapter 2464</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's because she's worth it. I love her determination, but my heart also aches for her stubbornness. I've never felt that way with other women. Daley Moss, you know what? I only hope that I can protect her and help her when she&rsquo;s in trouble. It doesn't matter if she doesn't love me. I only hope that she can live a good life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But isn't it sad to love without expecting anything in return?" Daley Moss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eldest brother replied with a smile, "There's nothing to be sad about as long as I don't feel sad. Love isn't always about possession or reciprocation. Sometimes, giving is happiness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only thought his eldest brother was foolish back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now it seemed that there was another fool! His eldest brother had said that Amber Mitchell was stubborn. It seemed to be the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss said nothing. With trembling hands, Amber Mitchell picked up the incense sticks on the ground and carefully lit them as well as the candles. Then, she knelt in front of the tombstone while looking at the candles and incense sticks that continued to burn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were full of sorrow, but she was so quiet that even her tears flowed down silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, the incense and candles were all done burning. Amber Mitchell muttered, "Herman, I'm going home now. I'll come back to see you when I've taken care of everything, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The night wind was still the only thing answering her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurried to help Amber Mitchell up. "Alright, let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell replied in acknowledgment, but she had been kneeling for so long that her legs had gone numb. She fell forward every time she tried to walk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said to Grace, "Let me help her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he picked Amber Mitchell up in his arms and headed for the cemetery&rsquo;s exit with Grace following him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as they were passing by Daley Moss, Daley Moss suddenly said, "the Moss family's cemetery isn't a place you can come and go as you please! I don't want my eldest brother to be disturbed again. I'll call the police if you come here again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell winced a little, and Jason said deeply, "You don't want to see her, but your eldest brother might feel otherwise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he took Amber Mitchell in his arms and left without waiting for Daley Moss to say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in the car, Jason put Amber Mitchell in the backseat. Grace also sat in the backseat to help take care of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the way, Grace looked at the wound on Amber Mitchell's forehead and said, "I need to get the doctor and nurse to take care of that. You're so reckless today. If there had been an accident, or if someone from the Mitchell family had taken the opportunity to take you away, what would&rsquo;ve happened then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell murmured, "I'm sorry. I just... really wanted to see Herman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finally had some freedom after being trapped in that dark mental hospital. She had been dying to talk to Herman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was kicked out during Herman's funeral. the Moss family would not allow her to come near.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not even offer him some incense before Herman's grave after his death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should be careful from now on. After all, you're not entirely out of the woods," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it. Thank you," Amber Mitchell said gratefully, knowing the woman had her best interest at heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the hospital, the nurse bandaged the wound on Amber Mitchell's forehead. After seeing Amber Mitchell back in the ward, Grace and Jason left the hospital.</p></div>
