        <h1>Chapter 982</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was because he had other things he cared about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian was willing to do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was willing to do such an extreme thing for Grace. It was as if all he cared about was Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper had left, but Grace was just dumbfoundedly standing where she was. What Chase Harper had just said echoed in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian almost killed Elise Dean for me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How is that possible? He always cared about me because he thought I was the one he was looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now that he has Stella by his side, why would he&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene at the police station yesterday once again recurred to her. He said he loved her with a serious expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how he said that he would find her and be good to her with the same serious expression when he was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His serious look seemed to have never changed after so many years...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace was leaving the building after work, Brian stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't we have dinner together? After all, we had a lot going on yesterday," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared somewhat blankly at the person in front of her. Then, she recalled what Chase Harper told her. 'Did this man almost kill someone for me yesterday?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not even imagine what he looked like at that moment. After all, most of the time, he gave people a sense of estrangement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he would not allow others to approach him easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Or do you want to talk to me here?" Brian added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace noticed that a lot of people were already looking their way. After all, Brian was an attractive man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Among the onlookers were several of her colleagues from the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace guessed that the gossip about her and Brian would be circulating in the firm again tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go somewhere else," said Grace. After all, she did not want people to look at her like she was a panda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, Grace just wanted to find a place to talk with Brian. However, he said he was hungry and wanted to find a place where they could have dinner. Therefore, Grace decided to go to a diner near her rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would come to this diner when she was too lazy to cook. The food here tasted good, and the price was also affordable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't mind eating here, do you?" she asked. It was a place she could afford with her current income.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, if it were up to Brian, she knew he would choose a fancy restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not want to owe him anything more, including the money for a meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why would I? I'm fine with anywhere you choose." Brian graciously pulled out his chair and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if it was only a simple square table and dining chairs that one could find anywhere, Brian sat with an indescribable elegance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the diner had become an elegant restaurant.</p></div>
