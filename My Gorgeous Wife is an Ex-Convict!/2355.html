        <h1>Chapter 2353</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You don't want me here? Who do you want here, then? Chase Harper?" he asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip. "No, I just thought... you had gone home to rest." Instead, he was waiting in her ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no feelings for her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the person in front of him and slowly said, "Kyla, the doctor said that the pain will flare up again if you insist on having this baby. Are you going to insist on keeping this pregnancy until the child is seven months old?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. I decided to keep the baby back then, so there's no need to think about anything else now," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you insist on giving birth to the baby even if it might shorten your life? Perhaps you'll live to be 70 or 80 without this baby, but giving birth to them can only let you live till 60," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze slightly before chuckling. "I think it's pretty good to live to 60. Isn't there a saying, 'You'll never know what comes first, tomorrow or an accident'? If I live to 60, my mother would have passed away by then and Nelson would be in his 30s, a fully grown adult. The baby would be 25. They would&rsquo;ve graduated from university and have a stable job. Perhaps they would already be dating and have found the person they want to spend the rest of their lives with. They&rsquo;ll be alive and well even if I'm no longer around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled as though she was content to live to 60.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought of her mother and her children but not him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If she only lives to 60, then I...' A panic suddenly burst in Martin Weiss's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes stared intently at the person in front of him. Moments later, he finally murmured, "Kyla, I'll give you one last chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on the corner of Kyla's lips faded gradually, and she looked at them with a hint of confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can promise to cooperate with you and give Jacqueline Bowman probation, but on the condition that... you and I will live like a normal married couple until we get divorced. We&rsquo;ll divorce a year after the baby is born, as per our agreement when we got married," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze, never expecting Martin Weiss to make such a request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why... Why?" She did not understand it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess I just want to get what I couldn't get before," he said while looking at her mockingly. "People are like this sometimes. The more they can't get something, the more they want it. And when they do get it, they might find that it's nothing much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he got together with her, perhaps the emotional fluctuations he experienced because of her would calm down, and he would realize that the woman was nothing. Then, they could have a peaceful divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hypnotist had also told him his affections would not recover as long as no one uttered the code word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had only influenced him &lsquo;slightly.&rsquo; Once they spent some time together, perhaps he would get tired of her and his emotions would stop fluctuating because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two hands Kyla put on her covers slowly clenched as her dark eyes looked blankly at Martin Weiss. After a long pause, she took a deep breath. "Okay, I promise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, then. I'll have someone take you back to Emerald City once you&rsquo;re discharged from the hospital. I'll also go to Emerald City once I've settled the affairs here." With that said, Martin Weiss walked out of the ward without giving Kyla another glance.</p></div>
