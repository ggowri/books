        <h1>Chapter 1613</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stood at the school gate with the little boy until it was almost time to go to the kindergarten to pick up Mick and Jasper. Grace said to the little boy, "Mason, I have to go back now. I'll come and see you the next time I get a chance, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one ignored Grace as if he had not heard her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's eyes dimmed, and she somehow felt a pang in her heart. It felt as though she was being forced to give up on something she wanted to hold on to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, she laughed at herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What's wrong with me? He's just a little child I met once.&rsquo; Although she felt a little sorry for what had happened to the child, she should not feel hurt about his attitude toward her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She calmed herself and then returned to Kyla's store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? You seem to care a lot about that child," said Kyla. She saw Grace accompanying that child the whole time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I met him when I was in the amusement park, and I feel a little sorry for him. But it seems his sister is quite protective of him," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla said, "Yeah, people who don't know would think they're biological siblings! The child clings to his sister. Sometimes, his sister will bring him here to buy some snacks. The child will only smile at his sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hopefully, they&rsquo;ll still be as close when they grow up." Grace sighed. "If you hear anything about the siblings being in trouble, let me know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you care so much about the child?" Kyla asked with some confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"A little. I want to help whenever I can. Maybe I'm hoping if I help others now, then when the child I haven't found gets into trouble, someone else... will help them out too," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla sighed at that but somehow understood Grace's behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, it's time for me to pick up Mick and Jasper. I gotta go. See you next time," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," Kyla replied with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once Grace left the store, Kyla's eyes could not help looking at the place where Martin Weiss's car was parked. Her eyes darkened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She lowered her head and continued to weave the bracelet in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss, who was in the car, looked at Kyla through the car window. When she glanced over, he almost froze and felt his blood rushing against the current.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was a fleeting glance and she lowered her head again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss smiled bitterly. 'What am I expecting? Am I hoping she'd see me again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It had been five years. He did not even know how to make up for the mistakes he had made. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had put Paisley Daniels in prison, got her case retried, and gave Kyla the dignity and innocence she deserved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, what she had lost could never be restored. What she had suffered could not be erased either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everything in this world had a price, but his price was too great!</p></div>
