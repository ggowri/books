        <h1>Chapter 3023</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip knew that although his words would have some effect on his son, it might take years to completely erase the deep-seated feeling of inferiority in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William's feeling of inferiority was only towards Jasper. Although he could manage to not feel inferior in front of others due to his mother's past crimes, it would be difficult for him to do so in front of the little princess of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, when people face those they care about the most, they tend to become more anxious and insecure, which can lead to feeling inferior about certain aspects of themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper holds a much greater place in William's heart than anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the incense burned out, Philip said to his son, "Okay, let's go now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," William responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The father and son left Lily's grave, and the next time they come back, it may be a long time from now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People are busy calculating and working hard, but in the end, they are just a handful of dirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda has been almost drowning in English these days, but her daily English conversation level has made great progress. She can't believe that she can now handle simple English conversations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, even if she really participates in a communication meeting, she can at least have basic conversations!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's worries about the communication meeting have finally lessened a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, her attention has shifted to whether she will get pregnant or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to be afraid of getting pregnant, but now... she is looking forward to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille interrupted her thoughts, "I think even if you don't have a child, you should hurry up and marry Brian. It's better than being so desperate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I'm not that eager." She defensively replied, feeling guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"To be honest, if you didn't have a child, when do you plan on marrying him? I see that you guys have a good relationship now, and his parents are accepting and approving of you." Camille said, in her opinion, Valda and Brian's relationship was going too smoothly, as if the obstacles of wealthy parents didn't exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe when everyone feels it's the right time." Valda thought for a moment and replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The right time? That's too abstract. I think you should hurry up and get pregnant so you can get married faster. If you don't get pregnant this time, let Brian work harder and revolutionize. There's always a time for success." Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's face turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Work harder, revolutionize...oh my god! If these words were turned into verbs...okay, if she thought about it any further, she would have a nosebleed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That night, Valda was drawing comics on her computer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's study had been divided in half, with one part becoming her workspace. Even the bookshelf was split in half for her use.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was drawing, Camille messaged her online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at the message that was sent to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille: I have something good for you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille immediately sent a file.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda opened it up and the title read "Things You Must Know When Preparing for Pregnancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, as Valda looked down, her face suddenly turned red. The content here, if you want to put it professionally, is quite specialized in some ways, using common language to explain some professional concepts.</p></div>
