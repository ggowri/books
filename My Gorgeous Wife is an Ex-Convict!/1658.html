        <h1>Chapter 1656</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He approached the bed and suddenly leaned over with both hands on the sides of her body. He looked at her intently. "Lina, I've never thought of you as someone I can order around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I think of you as my everything!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She stared blankly at the face that had suddenly approached her. She met his deep and beautiful eyes. She fell into a trance for a moment before quickly coming to her senses and backing away in panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she was leaning against the headboard of the bed now. There was no more room for retreat. His face got closer to hers. "Lina, do you know how much I missed you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His husky voice had a touch of seduction in it, affecting Lina's mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked away, avoiding Hadwin Stephenson's eyes. She was scared she could not control herself and would fall for the man again if she saw his eyes up close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not seem bothered with her reaction and continued with a husky voice, "For five years, I thought about you and regretted my actions every day. If I had been less confident and more cautious, then all this would not have happened. Maybe we would've been married and had children now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina quivered slightly. "That's enough. Hadwin Stephenson, what's the point in saying this now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It&rsquo;s not enough! How can it be enough? I want you to know that I never loved Katherine Jackson. You're the only one I love!" He finally uttered the words he had been keeping in his heart for five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the past five years, he had only told himself this because he was devising a plan to take on the Jackson family. He could not make the same mistakes again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's breathing instantly hitched. She turned around and stared at Hadwin Stephenson with wide eyes as though she could not believe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I love you. I've never loved anyone but you. I only got together with Katherine Jackson to reclaim the Stephenson family and bring the Jackson family&mdash;" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before he could finish, she interrupted him, "Did you say you've never loved anyone but... me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes,&rdquo; he said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm... the one you love?" she continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes." The same affirmative answer came out of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She stared blankly at him before suddenly smiling. "You love me and you always have, but... you can give up love to reclaim the Stephenson family for wealth and power, right? And now you&rsquo;re here looking for love because you got your wealth and power back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her smile made him burst into panic as he sensed that she was getting further and further away from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was right in front of him. He could easily touch her by raising his hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, Lina. Listen to me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What more is there to say? Hadwin Stephenson, we&rsquo;ve never been in the same league. I couldn't help you like Katherine Jackson, so you chose to break up with me. You'll dump me again if you encounter a crisis in your career in the future and need a second Katherine Jackson, won't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I won't dump you again. As long as you... still love me, I have faith that I'll find a solution no matter how difficult things are." As long as she was willing to stay with him, he would fight tooth and nail to remove the obstacles in between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the answer he got was... "Sorry, I don't love you anymore."</p></div>
