        <h1>Chapter 3358</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lornell, are you sure you're not mistaken? You want us to apologize?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, they had more people and beat us up. It's already good enough if they don't apologize to us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Lornell lazily said, "Whoever said those words before should apologize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it seemed like a casual remark, it made the faces of those few children change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, four children stood up and walked to Valda, reluctantly apologizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley widened his eyes and carefully looked at Lornell, only to realize that he was the leader of these people! But... "Why don't you apologize?" Harley suddenly rushed to Lornell and asked loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This sudden change shocked everyone, especially the responsible people of the hotel who didn't want to offend either side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he fully understood what it felt like to eat bitter gourd, it was so bitter! But he couldn't say anything and had to keep a smiling face towards both sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, he thought that choosing his hotel to hold the little princess's birthday banquet was a good thing. But now it seems that it is simply the unluckiest thing ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I apologize when I never said such a thing?" Lornell asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley blinked her beautiful phoenix eyes, as if to say... yeah, that makes sense!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She heard these people talking bad about her mother before, but this boy didn't actually say anything. Instead, he seemed to have interrupted those people's conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... are you really powerful that they listen to you and apologize? Why do they all listen to you?" Harley asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know, you can ask them," said Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After apologizing, the children returned to Lornell's side and said, "Lornell, let's go. Don't waste time talking to this little guy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell was about to take a step when Harley suddenly said, "I'm not a little guy, my name is Harley! What's your name?" She directed this question towards Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Lornell seemed uninterested in giving his name. As he took a step forward, two little paws suddenly grabbed onto his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell, with his beautiful yet distant face, looked at Harley with some surprise and asked, "Why are you hugging me?" He generally didn't like to touch girls too much, as he saw them as troublemakers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, I was feeling really bored and decided to join some other people. However, things took a turn for the worse when I ended up getting into a fight because of a girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was still feeling unhappy, and now this little guy had actually hugged his arm directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to know your name," Harley said in a childish voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I don't want to say," Lornell said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he was still young, this innate cold and distant temperament would still create a sense of distance between him and others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And once he became cold, it would make people inexplicably frightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those children from the Crypt families, led by him, followed his orders. Apart from the Quentin family's status, part of the reason was Lornell's cold personality, which was different from theirs but made people unable to help but obey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why?" Harley asked strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No reason," Lornell still looked indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Valda walked up and said to her daughter, "Harley, come down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I want to know his name," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If someone is unwilling to speak to you, you should also respect their wishes," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh." Harley responded with a bit of a sulky tone, letting go of Lornell's hand. However, she then grinned at Lornell and said, "Anyway, you'll definitely be willing to tell me your name in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This smile exudes immense confidence, as if certain that one day in the future, it will come to fruition.</p></div>
