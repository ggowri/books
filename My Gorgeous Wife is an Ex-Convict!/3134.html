        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What else could it be? Do you think I'm planning to call off the wedding?" Valda joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after she said that, Brian's expression changed and he asked seriously, "You...would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even his voice trembled a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda didn't expect her joke to trigger such a reaction from Brian. Did she make this man feel insecure? She couldn't help but blame herself and said to Brian, "Of course not, Brian. I won't call off the wedding. You want me to be Mrs. Hart, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did he breathe a sigh of relief and smiled, "Yes, you're going to be Mrs. Hart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille, who was standing next to them, shook her body and said, "Can you guys at least consider the feelings of single people? Mr. Hart, Mrs. Hart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blushed at her friend's words, "Camille, why did you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't you just say you're going to be Mrs. Hart? Since we're going to call you that sooner or later, I might as well start now," Camille said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian spoke up, "Alright, let's eat. I'll bring out the food."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay!" Camille quickly responded. After all, it was the prince's cooking, and others couldn't even have a taste of it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian made four dishes and a soup, which was just enough for the three of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the meal, Valda asked, "By the way, are you guys free this weekend? I want you to accompany me to see the latest house I've been looking at."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure." Camille readily agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian asked, "Do you really like that house?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay. Besides, I can be neighbors with Amber for a while, and I also need a place to call home." Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's go see it this weekend." Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the weekend, Brian and Camille accompanied Valda to see the house. The decoration was decent, and the agent said that the landlord could lower the price by another fifty thousand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, what do you think? Is it good?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not bad, it's pretty good! And the location is convenient for daily life. We can also plant some flowers and plants in the backyard." Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After carefully examining the house, Brian turned to Valda and said, "If you like it, then go ahead and buy it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Valda expressed her intention not to buy a house, the agent said, "Miss Theller, you're planning to take out a loan, right? The bank will need..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Full payment," Brian interrupted the agent, "I'll pay in full and can do so at any time. When is the earliest this property can be transferred to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The intermediary looked surprised upon hearing this. The house costs over 4 million yuan, which is not a huge sum, but not many people can afford to pay it all at once. Moreover, the payment can be made at any time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I will go ask the landlord right away," the agent hurriedly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, the process of buying the house went exceptionally smoothly. That same afternoon, the landlord came over and signed the contract directly. Since the landlord's family did not live in the house, after signing the contract in the afternoon, they directly paid and transferred ownership, and everything was completed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was a bit stunned as she looked at the brand new property deed in her hand and couldn't quite believe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has already bought a house?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wow, that was really fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille, who had been accompanying all along, exclaimed, "Indeed, the power of money is strong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was also deeply moved.</p></div>
