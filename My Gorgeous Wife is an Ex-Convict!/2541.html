        <h1>Chapter 2539</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her morning sickness this time seemed worse than during her last pregnancy. Back then, she stopped suffering from morning sickness after the first three months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, not only did her morning sickness not go away this pregnancy, but it also got worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time he saw her pale face, his heart sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason came to the washroom door. Listening to the sound of retching coming from inside, he gently looked down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian..." He mumbled the words, and gloom flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Brian returned to Emerald City, there was no way he could affect him and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because he would not allow it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not expect Brian to come to him the day after Grace told him about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you agree to let Grace proceed with the pregnancy?" Brian went straight to the point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at him coldly. "This is between Grace and me. You have no right to ask."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But do you have any idea how dangerous it is to let her proceed with the pregnancy? She might lose her uterus!" Brian lunged forward and asked as he approached Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's thin lips smiled slightly as his eyes glimmered dangerously. "It seems you&rsquo;ve checked her medical records before coming to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's thin lips pressed together slightly. He had indeed looked up her medical records and found out the danger she was facing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A layer of cold sweat had broken out on his palms after he learned the dangers of her pregnancy. Her pregnancy this time turned out to be such a burden on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then listen here..." Jason's voice rang slowly. "Brian, Grace is my wife, and she is pregnant with my baby. It's up to her and me to decide whether to give birth to the baby. Who do you think you are using to say these to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian froze. After a while, he said, "Yes, Grace's your wife. I know that better than anyone. But you need to know that I was willing to let go of her because she loves you. It's also because I believe that you can protect her. If you can't protect her and let her get hurt, I won't let her go even if she loves you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You won't let go?" Jason suddenly sneered and raised his hands to grab Brian's collar. His handsome face was gloomy. "You have no right to say that to me because Grace will never love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Never? Who are you to say that?" Brian similarly stretched out his hands and grabbed Jason by the collar, "If I had asked for her name and address, I might have found her sooner! If you hadn't deliberately erased some of her information, how could it have taken me so long to recognize that she was the one I was looking for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had spent many nights regretting it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He regretted falling into the trap so foolishly. He knew Grace before Jason. He had gone through thick and thin with Grace since the beginning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had feelings for Grace at the time, but he still mistook the wrong person and even... hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you hate me?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Yes, I hate you! If you hadn't tampered with the evidence, I would&rsquo;ve recognized her. She and I might even..."</p></div>
