        <h1>Chapter 4047</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina and Chandler returned to their table, but Hadwin and Lina were not there. They must have gone to chat with friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina sat in her chair, holding her phone and happily taking a picture of the autograph she just received to send to her friend Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really that happy with just one autograph?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, Kit's signature is now worth a fortune! If it were sold online, it could easily fetch several thousand dollars," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the Stephenson family's wealth, Tina did not have the habit of spending money recklessly like a spoiled rich girl. Her concept of money was actually quite similar to that of an ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, this was also due to the education she received from her mother, Lina. Lina herself came from an ordinary family, and even though Hadwin was very wealthy, Lina still insisted on spending money where it was necessary and saving where it was possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when Tina was in elementary school, Lina had set a rule for her allowance. At first, she gave Tina 100 yuan per week to spend as she pleased, but she wouldn't give her any more if she went over that amount.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, although Tina's allowance increased as she grew older, it was still only at the level of an ordinary person who was slightly better off. She never reached the point where she could spend money recklessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, Tina's daily expenses for food, clothing, and other necessities were not paid for with her own allowance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So whenever Tina was "broke," she would go to her father and Chandler, the two big wallets, to help her out of her financial difficulties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Several thousand dollars is worth getting so excited about?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina sighed and looked at Chandler with a limited understanding of the value of things. "You don't know how much money means to us poor people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a bit funny to hear this from the mouth of the Stephenson family's daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Chandler knew exactly how much money Tina had in her pocket. "Just tell me what you want to buy. You don't have to pay for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hehe, I knew you were the best to me, the most generous. Love you!" Tina said happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler's eyes flickered. He knew that Tina's "love you" was just a figure of speech. Over the years, she had always accepted his identity as her fianc&eacute; so naturally, stayed by his side so naturally, and called him "Chandler brother" so naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was by her side from the moment she opened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, no matter how busy he was, he would visit her at the Stephenson family every few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were intimate and never avoided anything, but...today, he still couldn't figure out what kind of feelings she had for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regardless of what those feelings were, he wouldn't let go of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina, I'm not generous," Chandler suddenly said, "I'm quite petty about some things, so no matter what happens, don't cross my bottom line, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina blinked, "What...is your bottom line?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised his hand and gently stroked her forehead, "No matter how many people you're interested in, the one you'll truly fall in love with can only be me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His deep voice made Tina feel a bit dazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was like he was telling her that no matter how she messed around outside and got entangled with other people, it didn't matter as long as she eventually returned to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But...why was he so persistent about this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because he loved her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But their engagement wasn't initially because of love, was it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, an 8-year-old boy couldn't possibly fall in love with a tiny baby, who hadn't even been born yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina only knew that he wouldn't tell her these answers now, so she would wait until the day he was willing to say it, and then she would understand why!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p></div>
