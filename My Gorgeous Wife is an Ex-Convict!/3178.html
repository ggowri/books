        <h1>Chapter 3176</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian..." She gasped, her breath unstable. "Don't... don't do this... what if someone comes in and sees us..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice brought back some of his sanity. He suddenly stopped and hugged her, burying his face in her neck. "Sorry..." he murmured softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He almost lost control just now because of his jealousy towards Raymond. He knew that Valda loved him now, but Raymond's appearance and Valda's confession of her past crush on him made him feel jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you apologizing for?" Valda asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian remained silent and held Valda tightly, she didn't resist and allowed him to hold her like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Brian's voice came low, "You still have a little bit of...feelings for Raymond in your heart right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The remaining words got stuck in his throat, as if he didn't know how to say them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is he afraid of her answer? If she says yes, what should he do? What will happen to this jealousy in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt the tension in his body, and she hugged him saying, "No, I don't have any feelings for Raymond anymore. In fact, my crush on him was just a delusion of someone who thought too highly of himself. Looking back, it wasn't real love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" He lifted his head and looked at her with burning phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really," she said with certainty, "at that time, I didn't really know what kind of person he truly was. I just saw him often in the library and projected some of the personality traits of the male protagonists in my ideal stories onto him, which led to a crush. But when I realized he wasn't like that, the crush naturally ended."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But even so, it still makes people jealous... Even if the person you have a crush on is just an illusion, at least their appearance is his appearance," Brian said with a hint of sarcasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda almost laughed at his teasing tone. He couldn't possibly be jealous about this, could he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If back then, you were my senior, I think I would have had a crush on you," Valda cleared her throat and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will you have a crush on me?" he raised his eyebrows and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," she said, her fingers tracing over his eyebrows and eyes, which were strikingly beautiful. She was referring to someone like him. "Do you know? When we first met, I saw you in the rain. Actually, at that moment, I think my heart was already beating faster."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, she was simply unaware that her concern was actually a crush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her and asked, "When was that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, when I saw you in prison without an umbrella, my gaze couldn't move away from you. I'm not the type of person who would actively greet strangers, but at that time, I approached you on my own. I think I actually had feelings for you then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda spoke while her fingertips continued to move across Brian's face. "Do you know that you are a very attractive man to women? This attraction is not just on your face, but also in your demeanor, which makes it hard for people to look away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just want you to keep your eyes on me and no one else," he said.</p></div>
