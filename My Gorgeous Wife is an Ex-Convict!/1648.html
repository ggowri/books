        <h1>Chapter 1646</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch instantly felt like she was slapped in the face again. It was far more painful and embarrassing than when she got slapped by Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm alright," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason gently massaged Grace's palm with his fingers. "Tell me if you want to slap someone next time. Don't hurt your hand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He glanced at her palm again as he spoke, "It's a little red now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mister... Mr. Reed, I..." Irene Lynch could not help voicing out. She was the one in pain. Her face was redder and more swollen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason seemed to remember that Irene Lynch was here and glanced at her coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"By the way, my wife may have left the Reed family for five years, but she's still the mistress of the Reed family. Since when did you gain the right to criticize her? And since when did the Reed family become your family? You&rsquo;ve never been a member of the Reed family, so don't think of the Reed family as your own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's icy voice and stare made Irene Lynch shudder as she said dejectedly, "But my... My daughter's... the Reed family..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wanna's indeed the Reed family's adopted daughter, but you have nothing to do with the Reed family," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch's face, which was red and swollen before, instantly turned pale. &lsquo;Have I just been an outsider to this man all along?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing Jason gently holding Grace's hand and rubbing her palm, Irene Lynch only found the sight irritating to her eyes. The pain on her cheek seemed to worsen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Reed, aren't you afraid that the Reed family's reputation will be tarnished because of Grace? Once that happens, even a century-old family like the Reed family&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before she could finish, Jason said, "As long as my wife wants, I can give away or destroy the Reed family at any time. The entire Reed family belongs to my wife, so why should you worry about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was stunned, not expecting Jason to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace occupies such an important position in Jason's heart! Why? Hasn't this man always been cold? Hasn&rsquo;t he shown zero interest in other women in the past five years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But why does he care so much about a woman who had left the Reed family for five years. He&rsquo;s even willing to give her the entire Reed family?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's not your job to worry about the Reed family. Also, you were the one who taught Oriel what she said today, weren&rsquo;t you?" Jason said directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... It&rsquo;s not me!" Irene Lynch felt guilty but was quick to say no. "I told you. She saw the video herself. In the video&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Irene Lynch, do you think you're too smart, or do you take others as fools? If it happens again, the Reed family will publicly go back on our decision to adopt Wanna.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch's expression instantly changed when he said that. 'Go back on their decision? If that happens, not only will I lose all the glory I have now but I&rsquo;ll also be ridiculed by everyone. I&rsquo;ll get trampled back to my poor state before!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Reed, you can't do this. Oriel has always thought of you as her father!" Irene Lynch said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason only replied coldly, "Then you should tell her that I never was and never will be her father!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Meeting Jason's eyes, which seemed to be able to read people's hearts, Irene Lynch only felt cold. The man was so cold to her... He was so cold that it was as if any plans she might have would not work on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would only have Grace in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why? What&rsquo;s so good about a woman who left the Reed family for five years and has probably cheated on him countless times during the period?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is she worthy of such gentle treatment from him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He should be gentle to me!' </p></div>
