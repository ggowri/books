        <h1>Chapter 429</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Frankly speaking&hellip; The real reason was because of Grace, right? Had Grace asked for Jason&rsquo;s help? Was that the reason why all of it was possible?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Grace returned to the ward with a bag of pomegranates in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Alright. When Nelson wakes up, if the doctor allows it, he can go ahead and eat these,&rdquo; Grace said with a big smile on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Thank you, Grace,&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn said, her eyes were slightly red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a bag of pomegranates,&rdquo; Grace replied, thinking that the other party&rsquo;s red eyes were due to them being worried about Nelson&rsquo;s condition. &ldquo;Nelson&rsquo;s surgery was a success, and he just needs to adapt to the cochlear implant, Kyla. There is no more danger, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry; everything will be fine.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yeah, everything will be fine.&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before this, she had thought of herself as Grace&rsquo;s savior as she was willing to allow the latter to work in her store when the other party was in a difficult situation. However, in actual fact, Grace was her savior!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not because of Grace, Nelson would never have been able to receive such treatment. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was still asleep when Grace left the ward with Jason. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to visit Nelson next time,&rdquo; Grace said as she waved goodbye to Kyla Corbyn and Mrs. Corbyn. Shortly after, she and Jason arrived at the parking lot of the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just as Grace was about to get into the car, Jason reached out his hand and took her directly into his arms. &ldquo;Smile at me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Grace was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Smile at me, just like how you did in the ward before,&rdquo; Jason said. Most of the smiles he saw of hers were shy and timid; he rarely saw bright ones like the one she had worn in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Grace&rsquo;s eyes were so bright and beautiful that he found it hard to look away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I usually smile at you?&rdquo; Grace asked, &ldquo;Why do you want me to smile so suddenly?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Because you smiled very beautifully, so I wanted to see you smile again,&rdquo; Jason replied in a low voice. His voice carried a tone that seemed like he was coaxing a child as he asked, &ldquo;Will you smile one more time, Sis?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only feel the blood in her body seemingly rush to her face once more. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s&hellip; a surveillance camera here!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, their every move was now perhaps being watched by someone on the other end of the surveillance camera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; Jason&rsquo;s eyes were burning with passion and were full of longing. &ldquo;Smile one more time, Sis. I want to see your smile one more time&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s heart&hellip; had begun to pound as she stared at Jason in a daze. The desire in his eyes made her want to satisfy him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There it was... a smile on her face that was as bright and magnificent as the sun&hellip; it was stunning&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the hospital, Grace was not expecting Jason&hellip; to really take her to the food street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Initially, they were merely passing by the street full of food stalls, and she had said out of nostalgia that she had not been there for a long time. Consequently, Jason parked the car nearby and brought her straight there.</p></div>
