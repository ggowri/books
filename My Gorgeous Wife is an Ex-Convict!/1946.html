        <h1>Chapter 1944</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because... that was their baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He cared about the baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the car drove to the best women's hospital in J City, Hadwin Stephenson carried Lina out. Fortunately, there were already doctors and nurses at the hospital waiting after they were notified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was sent to the consultation room for examination, while Hadwin Stephenson stood outside the room, holding the phone Lina had been holding earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had no idea that she cared so much about those photos. She even spent the entire afternoon visiting phone repair workshops to recover those photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Her memories?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson had an indescribable feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, the phone rang. The caller ID showed the word &lsquo;Mom&rsquo;. He knew it was probably a call from Lina's mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After pondering for a moment, Hadwin Stephenson answered the call. "Aunt? I'm Hadwin Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney, who was on the other end of the line, was surprised. "You... Why did you answer the phone? Where's Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She wasn't feeling well just now, so I brought her to the hospital. The doctor is still examining her," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" Mrs. Sweeney's surprised mutter came from the other end of the line. Then, Mrs. Sweeney hurriedly asked Hadwin Stephenson for the hospital address and ended the conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson put away the phone and leaned against the wall. Looking at the phone in his hand, he murmured, "Lina, what should I do with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'A month? Should I let her stay with me for a month and then we'll go our own ways a month later?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But can I let her go again after spending a month with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Perhaps it&rsquo;s best if I just be with her. But does she love me? Or maybe she just came back to me because she feels sorry for me and wants to give the baby a complete family after Katherine Jackson told her the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If... she doesn't love me all that much, can I be with her for the rest of my life? If she&rsquo;s only doing it for the kid and to make up for the guilt...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney happened to reach the hospital when Lina's examination results came out. Mrs. Sweeney rushed up to the doctor and asked, "Doctor, how's my daughter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The patient was agitated, so there were some signs of miscarriage. The patient has shown some signs before, so it's best if she can try to control her emotions from now on. Otherwise, she&rsquo;ll still face the risk of miscarriage later into her pregnancy,&rdquo; the doctor replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney repeatedly spoke to the doctor, while Mr. Sweeney went up to Hadwin Stephenson and said, "I know Lina misunderstood you before and broke your heart, but she's pregnant with your child. Even if you don't want to get back together with her, please don't trigger her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was silent and did not say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney did not go on but went into the ward with Mrs. Sweeney to see their daughter. Hadwin Stephenson took out a phone and ordered his subordinate on the other end of the line, "Take care of Lina's hospital expenses, and find two attentive caretakers..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After he was done giving orders, Hadwin Stephenson left the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Lina... What should I do with her?'</p></div>
