        <h1>Chapter 3242</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wants to be able to stand by her side in the future without anyone telling him he can't!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All of this requires him to constantly work hard and become stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." Jasper nodded and reached out his right pinky finger, hooking it with William's pinky finger. "Let's pinky promise. If you get it, you have to tell me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." He smiled slightly. If that day comes, he will definitely tell her that what he wants is her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One month seemed to pass particularly quickly. When Kyla received a call from the wedding dress tailor informing her that her wedding dress had arrived, she was stunned and suddenly felt uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because if the wedding dress was ready, it meant that it was time to take wedding photos. And when the wedding photos were taken, she would have to say the words that could release Martin from hypnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one knew how Martin would feel about her once the hypnosis was lifted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had to do it because she didn't want to live in fear of the future. She wanted to continue living a happy life with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially in this past month, she could feel that their relationship had become closer, and there was more laughter and joy in their home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All of this was what she had always pursued - a warm and happy life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this happiness is built on fragile ground, it's better to take the initiative to break that thin ice and work hard to bring them back to their own shore, where they can stand firmly and securely together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That way, it can last longer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla arrived at the photography shop and tried on her custom-made wedding dress. It fit perfectly and didn't require any alterations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she confirmed with the staff the time for taking the wedding photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After everything was settled, she went to Martin's office building on the Emerald City side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the two of them started living together, Martin has been spending most of his time in Emerald City. As a result, many of his work responsibilities have also shifted to Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weiss Group's office building is located in Emerald City, but Kyla rarely visits. As a result, the security guards and receptionists at the entrance do not know her and did not let her in at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Kyla had to call Martin's phone directly, "Are you currently on this side of the company?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm here, what's up?" said Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am right downstairs at your company, could you please ask the security to let me in?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin said, "Okay, then you make a video call and I'll talk to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla switched the call to a video call and placed her phone in front of the security guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the video, Martin said to the security guard, "Let her in, she's my wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The security guard immediately widened his eyes. The person in the video was indeed their own chairman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, you mean the person in front of us is the chairman's wife?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, the security guard's forehead immediately broke out in a thin layer of sweat, and he quickly said, "Yes, yes, I understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the phone call ended, the security guard respectfully escorted Kyla to the elevator and even pressed the button for her. It wasn't until Kyla had entered the elevator and the doors had closed that the security guard let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he walked past the front desk, the receptionist asked in a low voice, "When you called that person the chairman's wife just now, is she really President Weiss's wife?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course it's true. The chairman just said it himself on the video call," said the security guard.</p></div>
