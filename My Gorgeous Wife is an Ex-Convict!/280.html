        <h1>Chapter 279</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does your hand hurt?" Lina asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's fine," Grace said. "The bandages make it look worse. I didn't feel any pain today and was able to carry things myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina breathed a sigh of relief and ordered a meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they ate and talked, Grace found out what was going on with the witness her best friend mentioned on the phone. A colleague at Lina's design studio had posted a video to their co-workers' group chat. From there, Lina saw the witness who testified back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man was the newly married husband of Lina's colleague's relative's daughter, and he now lived in S City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina asked his name casually, just in case, but the colleague did not know his name. The colleague only kne that his last name was You.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were not many people with the last name &lsquo;You&rsquo;. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina played the video for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a video of the newlyweds being teased. The video was full of joy and laughter. Grace's eyes were fixed on the groom in the video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The groom's face was full of happiness as he fulfilled some of the demands with the heckling of the others around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It looked like a normal festive video, but the only unusual one was the groom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the face as her mind seemed to stir up a storm at sea. Up till now, she could still remember the man who had coldly testified against her in court. He had said that he saw her drinking and that he even persuaded her not to drive, but she refused and drove away obstinately!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, these things never happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never even met this person before. They just happened to be dining in the same restaurant, and he just happened to sit at the table next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even now she did not understand. Why would he say that in court? Did someone ask him to say that? Was there someone who wanted to pin the blame on her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was precisely because the witness had no stake in her that the judge took the witness' testimony more seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially when... there were more than one witness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it him?" Lina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it should be," Grace said. &ldquo;Can you find out where the man is now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It shouldn't be a problem. I'll ask my colleague later," Lina said. "Are you going to look for him in S City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll at least investigate some of the basic things first before I go. We've lost track of the witnesses back then. He is the only lead we have so far," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina understood her best friend's concern. She was afraid that this clue would be gone when the time came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the accident was so bizarre with so many witnesses testifying against Grace at the same time. It was as if there was some invisible network plotting at the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. Let's get this straight first," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, as they talked, Grace seemed to feel something and looked up to see a parked car not far away. The window of the car was open, and a man was sitting in it looking in their direction.</p></div>
