        <h1>Chapter 451</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men got into the car. As the two women were already in the back seat, Hadwin got behind the wheel while Jason sat in the passenger's seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car was on the road, Lina suddenly felt as if her rattletrap had gotten an upgrade. Others would be shocked if they knew that the president of Reed Group and the president of Stephenson Group were both in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On their way there, the two men in the front row were silent while the two women in the back were chatting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina did most of the talking while Grace just listened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, there's a very popular TV series recently. It's called The King's Lover. Have you seen it?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. She would go to work during the day and only went home at night. At most, she only had some time to check several news feeds on the internet before going to bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's pretty good. The plot... Tsk tsk... I can't spoil it. I'll give you the link for it later. By the way, the male lead is the Howell Webb you liked a lot back then," said Lina. She was once again hooked on the actor because of the TV series.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was also his fan for a while, but she got hooked on another TV series and fell under another actor's spell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a fan, Lina was definitely an unfaithful one. She would like this one today and like another one tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Howell Webb. How long had it been since she paid attention to the actor? Before she went to prison, she was actually a fan of the celebrity, which of course, meant contributing to the ratings and occasionally buying some of the actor's endorsements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she went shopping with Lina, she would also introduce the TV series the actor starred in because she thought he was good in terms of looks and acting. He might get popular in the future if he had the chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Listening to Lina mentioning Howell Webb now made Grace feel like she was going back in time. It seemed that she had always been tense after being released from prison. How long had she not relaxed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had something important to do today, but in the car, she was somehow relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Grace. Speaking of which, it had really been a long time since she watched a TV series.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no opportunity to do so in prison and no mood to do so after she got out of prison. The fatigue of working every day seemed to almost wear her down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she was working in the small restaurant and only finished work at nine o'clock at night, she still had an hour or two for leisure time before going to bed. Since she did not have to wake up as early in the morning as she did when she was working at the Sanitation Service Center, she was living a more balanced lifestyle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, who was sitting in the front row, looked impassive as he heard this, but his eyes glistened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Hadwin, when he heard Lina recommending The King's Lover, he was immediately speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had been telling him how good it was and how touching the plot was all this time. Of course, the most important thing was how handsome the male lead was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to Lina, the male lead was simply the best spokesman for someone who was good-looking, powerful, but tragic! She only wished to travel into the TV series and comfort the male lead, which made Hadwin angry and helpless.</p></div>
