        <h1>Chapter 2163</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's face grew more and more serious. After all, William telling lies was the last thing she wanted to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But nothing is absolute. I&rsquo;ll have someone check the house to see if there was anything that could have made the sound. Perhaps we missed it," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The three of us and Nelson missed it?" Grace thought the odds were slim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina laughed drily. "Alright, I know you don't want William to be involved in this. But what if he did push Nelson on purpose? Maybe he wasn't trying to push Nelson down the stairs but was just trying to scare Nelson? After all, most of the time, children pull pranks without thinking of the consequences!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace sighed. If William did it and the &lsquo;sound&rsquo; was just a lie he made up, maybe it was better to give William back to Philip Barlow as Jay had said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, William lay curled up in bed. Jasper had not talked to him for two days. Even though he ate at the same table as her as usual, Jasper did not give him any attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All the servants in the house saw this, of course. They gave him the cold shoulder. They used to scold and stop their children when they saw them bullying him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, they now pretended not to see it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There had been a lot of talk about him pushing Nelson Corbyn down the stairs in the residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The servants' children began calling him names behind his back, telling him to get out of the residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Jasper, has she... Has she given me up too? She doesn&rsquo;t want me anymore?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William hid under the covers, feeling so cold!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He missed Jasper sharing a bed with him and telling him stories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had been practicing the piano these days, only wanting to get better and play more complicated songs so she could like him even more. He would feel satisfied as long as she smiled at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, all she did now was glare at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if she was looking at a naughty kid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She must think he was naughty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's tiny body kept curling up. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day in kindergarten, William plucked up his courage and asked Jasper Reed, "Jasper, can you... please not ignore me?" He sounded like an abandoned puppy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper looked at William. "Why did you push Nelson down the stairs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I wasn't trying to push him down the stairs. I... I heard a sound heading toward him and I was... I was just trying to push him away. I... I wasn't trying to push him down the stairs," he struggled to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You liar! Nelson said he didn't hear anything!" Jasper got even angrier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's little face turned utterly pale. "I... I'm not lying. There really... was a sound... By the way, doesn't... Doesn&rsquo;t Nelson Corbyn have hearing problems and can't hear..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper retorted, "Nelson was wearing his hearing aids that day. He could hear! William, you refuse to admit your mistake and are even telling lies. I hate you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, she turned around and ran away, leaving William still standing there alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does she... hate me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He felt so upset all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What do I have left if even she hates me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed was standing nearby, with his peach blossom eyes that were similar to Jason's staring at William. He seemed to be thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The entire day at kindergarten, William's mind was in a mess as he kept recalling Jasper saying, &lsquo;I hate you!&rsquo;</p></div>
