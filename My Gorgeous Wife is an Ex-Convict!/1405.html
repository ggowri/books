        <h1>Chapter 1404</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He just dared not believe the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because once he believed it, he would be consigned to eternal damnation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If... Kyla Corbyn was really the one who donated me the bone marrow, what have I done to her all these years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I approached her, made her fall in love with me, retaliated against her, testified against her in court, put her in jail, and even fought for Nelson's custody with her after she gave birth to him...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One by one, all his misdeeds made his body tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss sat on the couch in the presidential suite without turning on the lights. He was putting himself in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, the doorbell rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The doorbell rang again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss lifted his hand, wiped his face, and walked to the door to open it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a man in a black suit outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Weiss, this is what Mrs. Reed asked me to give you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss was stunned. "Mrs. Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mrs. Grace," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss was surprised. 'Is Grace... married to Jason? Is that why she's being addressed as Mrs. Reed?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he did not care about Grace's relationship with Jason. All he cared about was... "What does she mean by sending this?" He looked at the USB flash drive the man handed over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There are two audio files inside. Mrs. Reed said you should be interested in them, Mr. Weiss," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss felt a sudden shock in his heart as he took over the USB flash drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Audio files that I'd be interested in? Could this be...' Martin Weiss looked at the USB flash drive in his hands in shock, his hands shaking badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After the man left, Martin Weiss turned on the lights and took out his laptop almost clumsily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a simple act of turning on the laptop, but he hesitated for a long time before finally pressing the on button. By the time he tried to plug the USB flash drive into the port, his hand shook so much that the USB flash drive fell to the floor from his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the black USB flash drive that had fallen on the carpet. He knew he was afraid. He was afraid of hearing the truth that would throw him into darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... he still wanted to listen to it no matter how scared he was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He wanted to listen to the recordings he had never heard before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss took a deep breath, bent down, picked up the USB flash drive, and plugged it into the port again. This time, he successfully plugged it in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The laptop showed that there were two audio files on the USB flash drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He first clicked on one of them, from which came the doctor's voice. "Is this Miss Paisley Daniels? I'm a doctor from XX Bone Marrow Bank..."</p></div>
