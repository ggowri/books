        <h1>Chapter 1250</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A dress?" Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They said, "Yes, it's a bridesmaid dress. Miss Lina has paid it in full. You can just come and get it. Miss Lina gave us her phone number too, but we can&rsquo;t reach her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's... hospitalized, so it's inconvenient for her. I'll come and get it," said Grace. She then ended the call after taking down the address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Bridesmaid dress...' Grace remembered Lina had mentioned custom-making her a bridesmaid dress to surprise her. Lina had been full of joy when she told her about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to the dress shop according to the address. It was a rather upscale bespoke clothing shop in tMason Swansonty. The clothes inside were expensive. Lina probably spent a lot of money on that bridesmaid dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked into the shop and said to the shop assistant who came over, "I'm Grace. Your staff told me to come and pick up a dress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay. Please wait a moment," she replied and asked Grace to wait in the lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three more people walked into the shop while Grace waited, and one of them was Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dressed in designer clothes, Stella was stunned to see Grace. She did not expect to see her cousin in such a place, but she looked noticeably better than a few days ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Grace, Stella's teeth tingled with hate. She had thought that by creating a gap between Grace and Brian, she could &lsquo;comfort&rsquo; Brian and make him develop feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had not been able to meet Brian for two days, and he did not answer her calls either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, it was her birthday party tomorrow. Brian had promised to come to her birthday party, and he always kept his word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she was going to have to find a way to win Brian's heart at her birthday party tomorrow night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, Grace. Is it appropriate for you to come to such a place instead of studying your rapist friend's case?" said Stella as she glared defiantly at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He was never a rapist, and you know full well who set him up," Grace replied coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean? Who wants to frame a man like him? I think you probably asked your friend to do something bad and tried to frame me instead, but you didn't think I&rsquo;d be lucky enough to get away with it. That's why you want to help Chase Harper with the case!" said Stella, deliberately raising her voice as if she wanted everyone around her to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, the two women who walked in with Stella said, "No way! She used such a dirty trick?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tsk tsk. Some women would do anything just to reach their goals. She must be jealous of you for having such a good life that she tried to frame you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two rich-looking women wanted to please Stella and took her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of them even said to the staff nearby, "Why don&rsquo;t you distinguish the types of customers that the shop can and cannot receive? How could you let a customer like this in? Aren't you afraid of tarnishing your reputation? We'll forget about this if you chase her out now. Otherwise, I'll tell my friends and we'll see what's left of your store's reputation after this."</p></div>
