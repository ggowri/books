        <h1>Chapter 2672</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman stood sullenly as her manicured nails dug hard into her palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does an ordinary woman like Valda Theller have to make Raymond Bowman fall in love with her? Raymond Bowman was in love with me first!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is Valda Theller always in the way? It's just like when I participated in a comic contest in high school, but Valda Theller was the champion while I was the runner-up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Runner-up? I don't want that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'd rather not want it if it isn't first place!' It was why she withdrew her comic and stopped drawing comics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Drawing comics was only her hobby at the time, and she did not see it as a future career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she met Valda Theller again at university. She was still drawing comics, and they were published.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time she saw her classmates praising Valda Theller's drawing skills, she felt as if she was being humiliated. Hence, she wanted Valda Theller to suffer. She wanted to destroy her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What happened afterward was just like what she expected. Valda Theller became the object of despise at school. She then lost interest in Valda Theller and stopped paying attention to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect Valda Theller to become a comic artist and have her comic be adapted into a drama. Besides that... she had Raymond Bowman protecting her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she could trample over Valda Theller back then, she could also do it now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, you&rsquo;ll be sorry! "Barbara Schuman muttered grimly to herself. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After learning that Barbara Schuman was sponsoring the TV show, Camille Strickland yelled, "F*ck!" Then, she looked worriedly at her best friend. "Valda, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled. "She's only one of the sponsors. What can she do to me? Will she ask the director and producer to remove my name from the TV show&rsquo;s credits or swap it to another comic?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland mumbled, "You're right. But she's vicious. Who knows what she'll do to you? People like her are psychopaths!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded in agreement and said, "It's just like what you said. She's indeed a psychopath. Anyway, we'll take the necessary measures when the situation calls for it. Since she came to us, we'll have to face her. We're not in university anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, let's see what she's up to this time!" Camille Strickland said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller went to the set the next day, she ran into Barbara Schuman again. Valda Theller stopped and looked at her with some caution in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman walked up with a smile and said, "Valda, I think there's some misunderstanding between us. I only sponsored this film for Raymond Bowman, nothing else. You know as well that Raymond Bowman liked me when we were in university, but we separated afterward because he became an exchange student. Since he wants to invest in this film because it has potential, I wish to help him too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's between you and him. You don't have to explain it to me," Valda Theller said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could I not explain? I remember you liked Raymond Bowman very much, didn't you? But you couldn't have him then, and you still can't have him now. I just don't want you to get hurt," Barbara Schuman said triumphantly, wanting to see embarrassment and reluctance on Valda Theller&rsquo;s face.</p></div>
