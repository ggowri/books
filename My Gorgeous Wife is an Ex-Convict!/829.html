        <h1>Chapter 828</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They fit just fine," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good. Tell me if you&rsquo;re still lacking anything. Don't be shy. You can just pay me back after getting your salary," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." Grace smiled, but after a moment, she looked like she was holding something back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it? Do you need something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's..." Grace hesitated a moment before saying, "When you picked me up yesterday... What was I doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought about it all day, but she still could not remember what she had done after walking out of Drunken Days drunk! She only vaguely remembered seeing Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... Uh, leaned in Jason's arms and blacked out," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze immediately. "Anything... else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. I arrived and helped you get into the car with Hadwin. However... Before I got back to the car, I impulsively slapped him because I was mad at him for breaking up with you. I thought I was going to be in trouble, but probably because of you, he just left without saying anything," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned, not expecting that such a thing would happen after she got drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Few people in Emerald City dared to slap Jason! However, he... was willing to let Lina off the hook?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, did Jason really break up with you because he thought of your relationship as a game?" After yesterday's incident, Lina found it a bit far-fetched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If he really treated his relationship with Grace as a game, how could Jason not go after me for slapping him? And it was because Grace said something when she was in a dazed state.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. He felt tired and doesn't want to love me anymore, so it's over. If that doesn't make it a game, then what does?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was speechless. She could only hope for her best friend to get over this failed relationship as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lay in bed after her video call with Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lights were on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could finally go to sleep with the lights off after dating him. However, after they broke up, she went back to sleeping with the lights on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was hot and stuffy in early August, even at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it took less than a year to fall in love with him, how long will it take to forget him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Regardless, I'll get over him one day!' Grace said to herself and slowly closed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her new job was hectic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past few days, her colleagues in the office had been talking about her behind her back, but at least no one would ask her face to face if she was dating Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz did not pester her these days, so Grace was left in peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the end of the day, Lawyer Carter handed her a document. The document needed the client's signature, but since the client was too lazy to visit the firm, they had to send it to the client for them to sign it before submitting it through the normal procedure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As an assistant, Grace naturally needed to run this type of errands.</p></div>
