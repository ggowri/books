        <h1>Chapter 1878</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her hands on the steering wheel began to sweat. She had not felt like this for a long time since she got back behind the wheel. Her heart pounded wildly, and there was a nagging uneasiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Will Jay ever forgive me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said that anyone could betray him but her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was doing it now. She was doing such a thing to him for Mrs. Watts... The thought of him drinking mouthfuls after mouthfuls of the vegetable beef soup she made and the sight of him lying in bed... Grace felt a pang in her heart again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Stop thinking about it,' she told herself. What mattered most now was to send her mentor and his wife out of Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once she arrived at the freeway and the person who helped her find out her mentor and his wife's whereabouts took them on the freeway, they should be fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car gradually approached the freeway, and Grace could already see the familiar words on the signboard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, as the car got closer and closer to the freeway, she froze. Her foot on the gas pedal loosened slowly, and her hand on the steering wheel shook slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She caught sight of a familiar figure through the windshield.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the car was about to crash, Grace suddenly came to her senses and slammed on the brakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car stopped, and she stared stiffly at the figure standing outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Why is Jay here? Shouldn't... he still be asleep? I added sleeping pills to his soup. He shouldn&rsquo;t be awake till at least eight hours later!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her hands were sweaty, and the uneasiness that was nagging at her earlier seemed to finally settle down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts, who was sitting in the back seat, looked out the window and saw a row of black cars parked on the freeway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason stood in front of the entry to L City with rows of men standing behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts was taken aback. Grace did not have to say anything. He could already figure out that his apprentice's plan had failed. There was no way they could leave Emerald City now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mentor, you and Mrs. Watts stay in the car while I... go down and talk to Jay." Grace took a deep breath and unbuckled her seat belt with trembling hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she opened the car door and stepped out, her feet felt like they were stepping on cotton.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace walked step by step toward Jason. Every step was so difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he only looked at her coldly. The cold moonlight fell on his beautiful and flawless face, making him look more and more indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay..." Her lips quivered open, and she said softly, "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, you betrayed me after all." His cold voice sounded particularly cold as it rang in the cold night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She trembled and heard him continue to say, "You once said you would never betray me. It turns out you can easily betray me for Mrs. Watts, whom you&rsquo;ve only known for two to three years."</p></div>
