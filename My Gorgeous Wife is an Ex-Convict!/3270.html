        <h1>Chapter 3268</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, go to your piano lesson first, otherwise Jasper will have to wait for too long and that wouldn't be good!" said Wilona.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh," Lawrence responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While riding her electric scooter, Wilona said to her son, "When you see Jasper later, tell her about the watch being stolen. Make sure she knows what happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's body stiffened, but he didn't want Jasper to know about the watch being stolen. He was worried that Jasper might get angry or blame him for not protecting the watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mummy... Can I not go for my piano lesson today? Can I go next time?" Lawrence pleaded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona refused, saying "No, I have to go!" She was still hoping to make a big fuss about her stolen watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper values Lawrence a lot, so he will definitely help him out. When that happens, everyone at school will understand that Lawrence's family has truly allied with the Reed family. From then on, no one will dare to mess with them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Wilona's mind, she was making plans and thinking that today was an opportunity that her family must seize and make the most of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After arriving at their destination, Wilona had Lawrence, who had a bruised face and wrinkled clothes with two missing buttons, go straight into the piano classroom to start his lessons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper quickly ran over when he saw Lawrence in this state and asked with concern, "Lawrence, what's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Lawrence bit his lip tightly, for a moment unsure of what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona quickly interjected, "Here's what happened. Mr. Barlow gave Lawrence a watch, which I thought was really nice, so I had him wear it every day. But today, while he was at school, some other students took it from him. They...they just saw Lawrence as an easy target because he's from our family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona spoke with a slightly teary voice, portraying a pitiful and sorrowful appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at the bruises on Lawrence's face, which were still red around the corners of his mouth. He raised his finger and couldn't help but touch them. "Does it hurt a lot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Actually... it's not that painful," Lawrence said, lying through his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it hurts, he doesn't want her to feel sad for him. But when he sees her worried expression, it brings a little bit of joy to his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He can't even distinguish himself what kind of feeling this is.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper turned to the piano teacher and said, "Teacher, can we skip piano practice today? I want to take Lawrence to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The piano teacher quickly agreed, "How about I accompany you guys?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need to trouble you, teacher. I'll just go with them," said Wilona.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The piano teacher didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the way to the hospital, Wilona rode in the passenger seat of the Reed family's car, while the two children sat in the back seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While in the car, Jasper noticed for the first time that Lawrence had many red marks on his left wrist, some of which had even broken the skin and were bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What caused such a severe injury here?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence whispered, "They wanted to steal my watch, but I refused to give it to them. However, I couldn't protect it and they forcefully took it away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice became quieter as it went on. Will she think he's useless? He can't even protect a watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, as her voice reached his ears, he suddenly shook.</p></div>
