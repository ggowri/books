        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the more he spoke gently, the heavier she felt in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the doctor bandaged Chandler's hand, they left the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let your hand touch water for a week, and remember to apply the ointment on time </span><span>every day," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Chandler replied gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pursed her lips, feeling this kind of tenderness again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know when it started, but his tenderness made her feel a sting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me drive you back," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I can go back on my own..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he finished his sentence, she interrupted, "I'll drive you back, and there's something I want to clarify!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler remained silent, naturally understanding what she wanted to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, instead of saying "okay," he silently followed her into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina drove back to Chandler's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They arrived in the living room, and Tina said, "Can you tell me what happened last night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler smiled bitterly. Some things, even if he wanted to hide them, would eventually be discovered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last night, the curse in my body was triggered. You know, I have a curse from the Hunter family, and the curse flares up periodically, just like what you saw yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina hesitated for a moment. "It's very painful, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's very painful. It can drive a person to lose control, be controlled by the pain, and even engage in harmful behavior," he explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there nothing to alleviate the pain? Like taking painkillers?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her intently. "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, there was a way. If he held her during the pain, it would gradually disappear. But his desire for her would become stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps then he wouldn't be able to resist having a sexual relationship with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were the old Tina who loved him, maybe he would use this method to alleviate the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not the current Tina. He wouldn't use this method!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina bit her lip. "So, you want the Quentin family to help you get rid of the curse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." He understood that she overheard his conversation with Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this method very dangerous?" There was a trace of worry in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It can be a bit dangerous, which is why I asked Lornell's grandfather for help. If he helps, there won't be much danger, at most a little discomfort," Chandler said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of discomfort?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's hard to say. After all, among the people of the Hunter family, there are very few who choose to remove the curse, and the results vary for each person," Chandler explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are the results for those in the Hunter family who remove the curse?" Tina couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Chandler didn't answer. He simply said in an indifferent tone, "We are divorced now, you have no connection to the Hunter family anymore, and this is the Hunter family's privacy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned. It was the first time she clearly felt Chandler drawing a line between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, do you have any other questions?" Chandler looked at Tina calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you should leave now," Chandler said. "Also, Tina, don't come here anymore in the future. If it's about Quinn, you can contact me by phone. If you need anything, I'll have someone take care of it. And in the future, when I remove the curse, if you want us to pretend to be good friends after the divorce in front of Tina, we can, but until then, let's try not to meet privately!"</span></p></div>
