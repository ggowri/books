        <h1>Chapter 1418</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did Martin Weiss hurt his hand?&rsquo; The speculation flashed across Kyla Corbyn's mind for a short while but she soon abandoned the thought completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not want to think about this man anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did he say anything to you when he came last night?" Grace asked as she sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn said lightly, "He seems to know about the bone marrow transplant and the fact that the Daniels family plotted the miscarriage. He said he would make up for these things, but I don't think it's necessary anymore." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn lightly spoke about it, but Grace knew she had been hurt too deeply, which was why she was so calm about it when the truth came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Paisley Daniels framed you and lied to Martin Weiss. Martin Weiss won't let the Daniels family off easily," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled faintly. "It has nothing to do with me anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing this, Grace knew that Kyla Corbyn did not want to talk about Martin Weiss anymore. Therefore, she changed the subject. "Has Aunt sent Nelson to kindergarten?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah," said Kyla Corbyn. During her hospitalization, her mother would come here every night with Nelson to spend the night with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she wondered how Mrs. Corbyn and Nelson reacted when they saw Martin Weiss. Grace thought to herself and asked again, "Are you still not willing to receive chemotherapy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn shook her head. "I probably won't be able to leave the hospital once I start chemotherapy. I want to spend more time with my mother and Nelson in my remaining days. I don't want to waste my precious time in the hospital. I'm getting discharged tomorrow. Grace, thank you for this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If Grace had not barged in that day, she had no idea what would have happened to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're getting discharged so soon?" Grace was surprised. "You can stay in the hospital for a few more days." After all, she would receive better care in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I... I don't like to stay in the hospital," said Kyla Corbyn. Staying in the hospital ward would only make her feel like she was counting down the days till her life ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a pause, Kyla Corbyn said with some hesitation again, "Regarding Nelson, I had thought of letting Martin Weiss raise Nelson after I die. But after the incident with Paisley Daniels this time, I realized Martin Weiss probably doesn't have much fatherly affection for Nelson. I... I want to entrust Nelson to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn hesitated to speak. She knew Grace would raise Nelson well if she entrusted Nelson to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, by doing that, Grace might be dragged into the mess between her and Martin Weiss, which would be unfair to Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At the same time, she did not know who to trust except Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace added by saying, "Kyla, I know what you mean! Don't worry. I'll protect Nelson, but you can also raise Nelson yourself until he grows up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's impossible!" Kyla Corbyn smiled wryly. "You don't need to comfort me. I know my condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Believe me, Kyla. You can do it!" Grace held Kyla Corbyn's hand tightly and said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace walked out of Kyla Corbyn's ward, she looked at Martin Weiss who was still standing straight in the same spot and said, "There's someone I want you to meet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss moved his eyes but said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course, it's up to you whether to see them, but it&rsquo;s related to Kyla&rsquo;s case." With that, Grace turned to walk toward the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The expression on Martin Weiss's face finally changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Case? Kyla's case, the one where she pushed Paisley Daniels down the stairs and I testified against her in court!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He trembled as he felt another fit of pain in his heart. He turned his head to glance at the ward with the closed door and hurriedly chased after Grace. "Who are you taking me to see?"</p></div>
