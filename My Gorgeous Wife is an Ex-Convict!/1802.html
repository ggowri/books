        <h1>Chapter 1800</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina&rsquo;s heart was in turmoil at that instant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson drove her back to her apartment after the concert ended, all she was thinking about was what Hadwin Stephenson had said and the song he sang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Did a man like him learn to sing for... me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can tell Anthony Sherman about your pregnancy but not your parents?" Hadwin Stephenson's voice broke the peace in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah!" Lina suddenly came to her senses. "I told Anthony Sherman because I thought I should tell him, lest I stop him from dating other people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at her gravely. "You're very considerate of Anthony Sherman, but what about me? What are you going to tell me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina hesitated and said, "Hadwin Stephenson, I don't want to marry just for the sake of the baby. If that's all there is to marriage, then I'd rather be a single mother like Kyla and raise my child alone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a pause, she took a deep breath. As if she had mustered a great amount of courage, she said, "Besides, I haven't figured out whether I'm keeping the baby or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she did keep the baby and give birth to them, he and she would probably be entangled with each other forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This child would become the bond between them for life, and perhaps it was the child who would be the most hurt in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes grew darker. "In the end, you still don't believe that I love you, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said, "I do, but I also believe that if you ever have to choose between your career and me, you&rsquo;ll give up on me once more.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Lina opened the car door and got down. "By the way, send someone to bring those packages away. I don't need them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said lightly, "If you don't want them, just throw them away. Lina, I'll tell you this one last time. Don't make any quick decisions. Just give me some time. Just... give me a little more time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Hadwin Stephenson's car drove away. Lina stood where she was. Her eyes were full of confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What does he mean by giving him a little more time?' She could not understand what he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Isn't five years long enough? How much more time does he want?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Can a little more time solve our problems? Can we ever go back to the way we used to be?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked down at her flat belly. With her present condition, she did not have much time left!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The baby was growing day by day in her belly. She had to decide as soon as possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The operation on Grace's hands went well, but she could barely move her fingers for a week. Hence, she spent another week being &lsquo;useless&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She needed help eating, drinking, and even going to the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason had moved his office to her ward. During the day when she was awake, he would take care of her while dealing with work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I feel like I can't do anything without you now," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is it a bad thing to rely on me? I wish you could rely on me more,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Aren't you afraid I'll become more and more dependent on you and then be a liability in the future?" she quipped.</p></div>
