        <h1>Chapter 4171 Police Station Call</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I wish you happiness," he restrained himself with all his strength, speaking in a casual tone as if acting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Thank you," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After Tina left, Kit stood still in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He forced a bitter smile, turning to look at the beautiful scenery around him, but his mood felt like a desert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So this was what losing felt like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was painful and unwilling, with even more helplessness!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> --------------</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin eventually agreed to his daughter's marriage, and the Hunter family quickly responded. Chandler's parents came to the Stephenson family immediately to discuss the betrothal and wedding date.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The dowry given by the Hunter family is naturally valuable, with many valuable antiques, each of which can be said to be priceless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This also shows the sincerity of the Hunter family in wanting to marry Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even though only a small part of the Hunter family's dowry was announced online, it has already stunned many netizens. They didn't expect the Hunter family's wealth to be even more impressive than they imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The couple bracelets bought from the Cupid Temple that Chandler and Tina are wearing have also been sought after by many young people, and the Cupid Temple even became a popular tourist spot for taking photos!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although Tina's wedding dress was a bit rushed, the Hunter family hired dozens of top-notch wedding dress craftsmen and finished it on schedule.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When Tina appeared in front of Chandler wearing a white wedding dress during the dress rehearsal, Chandler's eyes lit up and his gaze became fixated on her, unable to look away for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "This dress is beautiful, isn't it? You can't take your eyes off it," Tina said with a smile as she leaned closer to Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "The dress is nice, but the truly beautiful person is you," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina's face turned red!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She's not the type to blush easily, but when someone who doesn't often speak sweet words suddenly says such sweet words, the impact is naturally extraordinary!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Now, bend down," Tina suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler raised an eyebrow slightly but didn't ask anything. He just bent down as Tina instructed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her lips were close to his ear, "We're having a baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her soft voice flowed into his ears through the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He stood there dumbfounded, momentarily without any reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina glanced at Chandler, who was staring blankly, and thought to herself, "Hmm... this is not how I imagined it. Shouldn't this be a happy moment?" She was really pregnant, which meant that once the child was born, his suffering would be relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Aren't you happy?" Tina spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler looked at the person in front of him and said, "I... I'm happy, but at the same time, I'm worried. You know about the Hunter family curse. Maybe our son, or grandson, or great-grandson... at least, our descendants will be like me. Will you... blame me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina frowned and then firmly held Chandler's face in her hands. "The one to blame is not you, but the person who cursed your family! And I believe that future generations will find better solutions. I also believe that our descendants will encounter someone who can help them lift the curse. They will be just as happy as we are!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her voice was so resolute and pleasant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was truly lucky to have her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, Chandler's phone rang, and the caller ID showed that it was the police station!</p></div>
