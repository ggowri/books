        <h1>Chapter 1184</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though this Bumblebee was not the one her grandmother had bought for her, looking at the same model would remind her of that time and the moments she had spent with her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma held a gentle place in her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Grace's smile, the sour feeling in Brian&rsquo;s heart became stronger. 'She and Chase Harper... No, she probably won&rsquo;t have any feelings for the man. They're only former colleagues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But why... can't I help overthinking it? It's as if I'm afraid he'll occupy an important place in her heart!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outside the ward, Stella peered furtively at the scene inside, a look of calculation flashing across her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace left Brian's ward and went to Nelson's ward. Chase Harper was also in Nelson's ward, playing with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one liked these Transformers toys. He kept playing with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, when will Nelson be discharged from the hospital?" Grace asked Kyla Corbyn who was nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The day after tomorrow. We'll be out by noon if nothing goes wrong," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll also come and pick up Nelson from the hospital at noon the day after tomorrow," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But that day is a working day. It's not very convenient for you," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Our firm has a two-hour lunch break at noon. I'll take the bus. It's convenient! I'll be able to help in case you're short of hands," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper said, "I'll come and pick up Nelson too. I have a car. It'll be more convenient if you have a lot of things. I can pick up Grace at noon the day after tomorrow and we&rsquo;ll come to the hospital together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two people in front of her were so kind that Kyla Corbyn did not refuse them again. She only said gratefully, "Sorry for the trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace decided to go home after a while, so Chase Harper said, "I'll give you a ride." Then, fearful of her disapproval, he added, "It's on my way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... Thank you," Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper drove Grace back to the rental house. On the way, Chase Harper suddenly said, "I'm... going on a blind date."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. "You're going on a blind date?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she was introduced by my relative. She's 28 years old and is in the financial field," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sincerely wished, "I hope the blind date will be a success!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sadness flashed across Chase Harper's eyes as he heard this. That question was his last test, so to speak. If she had hesitated a little, he would fight for his feelings again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she only wished him good luck without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, let's hope my blind date will be a success," Chase Harper also said with a smile. He told himself that he should try to let go of his feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they could not be lovers, he hoped they could be friends!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car came to Grace's neighborhood gate where Grace got off and walked inside.</p></div>
