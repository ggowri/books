        <h1>Chapter 1425</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But..." Grace frowned suddenly and let out a cry of surprise. Her hands subconsciously covered her bulging belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter?" he immediately asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The babies... are kicking me," said Grace. She had been able to feel their movements for some time now, but they were always so light and vague that she sometimes thought it was an illusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, that kick earlier was a real kick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, again and again, it was as though they were doing exercises in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The babies are kicking you?" Jason's eyes fell on her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, feel it." As she spoke, she took his hand and placed it on the spot where the babies were moving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With the babies moving again and again, Jason was a little stunned. He had looked up relevant information and knew when and how a pregnant woman might feel the baby's movements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... theoretical knowledge was just theoretical knowledge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a different feeling when he felt the babies' movements for himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if he was really becoming aware that the small babies in her belly were alive and moving. They would even cry, shout, and slowly grow up after they were born...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Jason's stupefied appearance and felt that he looked more adorable than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No one else had probably ever seen him like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Grace had settled into a comfortable position on the couch, she continued to let Jason press his hand against her belly and told him which baby was in which position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if they could feel their father's big hand, so the triplets lifted their arms and legs, kicking around especially hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There were movements in her belly from the left to the right sides!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason lowered his head and felt these movements carefully. Looking at the scene in front of her, Grace could not help taking out her phone and taking a photo of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why are you taking photos all of a sudden?" he asked, looking up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We'll keep it as a memento. After the babies are born, I can tell them how their daddy touched them through my belly when they were still inside me!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, as if feeling it was not enough, she raised her hand to lift his chin and said a little playfully, "Come on, Jay. Smile."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes were suddenly red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was stunned and wanted to withdraw her hand. "Do you hate it when I do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No." He took her hand, and a soft smile appeared at the corners of his lips. "I love it, and I'm happy. Grace, thank you for all this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was giving him a family again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was looking forward to the birth of their three children. They would never turn out the way he had!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His smile was on the corners of his lips, looking stunningly beautiful against his reddened eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels had suddenly become a national celebrity because of the video of her scandal that was shown on the streets.</p></div>
