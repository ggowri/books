        <h1>Chapter 3717</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body stiffened, and her lips, with her own warmth, pressed against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her words just now lingered in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason...Mason..." How long had it been since he heard that name?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said she wouldn't hate him, no matter what. Was it true? Then why did she say she hated him when she misunderstood him before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of feelings did she have for him in the past? If it was just familial love, why was it so easy for her to hate him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he believe her words now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he choose this kind of hypnosis in the first place? If he wanted to forget his </span><span>feelings, wouldn't it be better to forget all memories related to her as well?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why choose to remember everything that happened between them, but forget the emotions he experienced during those events?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's like watching a movie of his own performance, but without the same state of mind he had during the actual performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the woman who occupies the vast majority of his past memories is approaching him, kissing him, and doing things that she could never do in his memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Veronica wanted to pull away, but her lips only slightly left his before his hand grabbed the back of her head and pressed her lips back onto his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was startled. "Mason, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish her sentence, his kiss invaded her mouth, deepening the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm..." She moaned, her hands instinctively pushing against his chest, but not pushing him away. She continued to passively accept the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know how long it had been, but when the kiss finally ended, Veronica was panting, her face already red, and she didn't even dare to look at Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you push me away?" he suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned and didn't react for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't the first time I've kissed you. I've kissed you before, but back then, you would push me away. Why not now?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She adjusted her breathing, her fingers unconsciously pulling on her own clothes. After hesitating for a moment, she looked up at him. "Because we're supposed to be trying, right? So...so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pursed her red lips. "Mason, I won't push you away again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her. "Some promises shouldn't be made too early, because you don't even know if you can keep them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can definitely do it!" she said firmly, her dark eyes shining with determination. "I will definitely be able to do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her eyes in surprise, and his calm heart began to stir because of her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He...was really easily influenced by her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he even wanted to believe her words, to believe that she would never push him away in the future, to believe in her promise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, Veronica, don't forget what you said today. If you can't do it in the future, I won't let you off the hook!" His voice rang out calmly.</span></p></div>
