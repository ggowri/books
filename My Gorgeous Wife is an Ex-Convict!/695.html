        <h1>Chapter 694</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hair, which had always been neatly combed, was now a little messy. A few strands of hair hung before his forehead, and his handsome face was not as indifferent and estranged as usual. Instead, it was showing some blurry decadence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his other hand, he held a small silver bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those phoenix eyes kept staring at the bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing the bracelet, Stella Lindsay felt even more complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of giving her the silver bracelet after she assumed Grace's identity, Brian kept it by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when she was with him sometimes, he looked at the bracelet as if he was looking at something through it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is he looking at? Is he thinking of Grace when she was younger?' The idea sent Stella Lindsay into a frenzy of jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian." Stella Lindsay bit her lip and pretended to be wronged. "Why didn't you come to see me at school today? Instead, you're drinking alone. You don't know how worried I was about you. I was afraid something had happened to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raising his phoenix eyes lazily, Brian looked at Stella Lindsay and smiled a little, but it seemed to be a self-deprecating smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I forgot. I'm sorry I worried you,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his words made Stella Lindsay feel even more uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was always so unaccustomed and polite to her that he never even took the initiative to take her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the picture she saw online today was of him taking the initiative to pull Grace into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Has something happened that&rsquo;s making you drink like this? I know I may not be able to help, but at least I can listen to you&hellip; Just as how you confessed to me when we were little," Stella Lindsay said with fake concern as she came forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, this was all what Grace had said to her when they were younger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was mentioning it now to remind him of the affection he had felt as a child and to treat her better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When we were younger..." Brian murmured. Then, he got up with a slight wobble, put down the wine glass in his hand, and approached her step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were already signs of intoxication in his phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he stood still before her, he suddenly murmured, "Why you? Why not her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay was stunned for a moment. She did not quite catch what he meant by that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, as she saw him looking at the small bracelet again, her blood suddenly froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What he means is that... Why am I the one who saved him when he was younger and not Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." She tried to say something but found her throat to be dry. His glance made her feel terrifyingly guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, you can leave. I'm okay, just a little tired. I want to be alone," Brian said lightly. He sat back on the couch and lowered his head to stare at the small bracelet in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the bracelet was the whole world to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's eyes were full of jealousy. 'Given time, I'll be able to take Grace's place in his heart completely!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would make him completely transfer the feelings he felt for Grace as a child to her!</p></div>
