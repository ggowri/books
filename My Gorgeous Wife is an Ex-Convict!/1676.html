        <h1>Chapter 1674</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Lawyer Watts&rsquo;s wife questioned Damian Harmon&rsquo;s purpose in doing this. If lawyers who did the right thing had to suffer such slander, then there would be fewer and fewer righteous lawyers in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many lawyers would be disappointed if those who committed slander were let off the hook!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The post instantly went viral.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Those who sided with Damian Harmon switched sides after seeing so many well-reasoned analyses by lawyers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon had become a public enemy in the legal world! Many lawyers even said they would never represent Damian Harmon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Some netizens dug out videos of Grace in court in L City. One could say that she won the cases swimmingly. Therefore, Grace started to gain many supporters online. They all praised her for having it all. She had a tall, rich, and handsome husband as well as a son and a daughter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A photo of Grace and Jason attending the banquet went viral online that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was wearing the limited edition gown that Irene Lynch had her eye on but was eventually bought by Grace. She did not even get a chance to try it on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was smiling, her comely face looking classy and elegant when paired with the gown. Jason was standing beside Grace in the photo, holding her hand and looking down as his stunning peach blossom eyes looked tenderly at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">From the photo, anyone could see that Jason was deeply in love with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Had a man like him ever looked at another woman with such a gaze?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was jealous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It should&rsquo;ve been me standing beside Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why does Grace have so many people speaking up for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Even the mocking remarks online have now turned into praises. Is it just because she&rsquo;s Jason's wife and the mistress of the Reed family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I spent so much money to execute this plan, yet I ended up helping Grace instead. Am I just going to watch netizens admire Grace for having it all?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch's face twisted with jealousy...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace returned to Reed Residence after sending her son and daughter to kindergarten in the morning, she was surprised to see two figures pulling and pushing at the gates. One of them had a bandaged wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As the car approached, Grace saw that these two people were Sean and Zoe Stevens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe Stevens was a far cry from the person she was five years ago. She was wearing designer clothes, probably from the days when the Stevens family was still rich.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the clothes were old and old-fashioned even though they were designer.</p></div>
