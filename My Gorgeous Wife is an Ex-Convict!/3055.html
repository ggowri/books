        <h1>Chapter 3053</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is this the bridge that Phoebe blew up? Did she do it to cut off the road in case someone was following?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt that Phoebe and Whitney were much better prepared than she had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They can calculate the schedules of buses and subways, figure out when they will arrive, and then tell her which one to take only about 30 seconds before it arrives...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These things probably require multiple pre-trial runs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more it is like this, the less likely there will be loopholes in the kidnapping of Jasmine by the other party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Can we really successfully rescue Jasmine and catch Phoebe and Whitney?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If we only rescue the child without catching these two people, it's likely that they will become a ticking time bomb again in the future, and we won't know when they will explode.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Valda was startled by the sound of a baby crying. She looked up and saw two low-hanging cable cars crossing the river not far away. Each cable car had a basket hanging from it, with one basket on the opposite side of the river and the other basket on Valda's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the cry of a baby is heard coming from a suspended basket on the other side of the river.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda shuddered, that must be Jasmine in the basket!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And here is... Suddenly, I remembered the day when Jasmine was kidnapped. She and Grace were on a boat tour in the ancient town, and the boatman mentioned that they were building some kind of drifting and amusement facilities around here...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And what's in front of us looks more like an unfinished entertainment facility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side of the river, a figure was flashing, and then Valda's phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, the voice that came through on the phone was Whitney's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, Valda, it's time for you to give me the password for withdrawing the funds!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can I ensure that I can pick up Jasper?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, let's do it this way. You sit in the basket, and I'll start the machine. When the two baskets meet, I'll press the stop button. That way, you can naturally hold onto your child and won't come to me. You'll stay in the basket the whole time. Then, you tell me the password, and I'll leave without any trouble. This way, nobody loses, right?" said Whitney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is it really that simple? Valda always feels like there might be some kind of conspiracy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But at the moment, there is no room for her to think too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney wants to escape, but it remains to be seen if she can actually get away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And she, no matter what, had to pick up Jasmine first before doing anything else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, Brian and the police can hear their current conversation, so they must have prepared their responses!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's it then." Valda walked over to the basket and carefully inspected both the inside and outside of it. After all, the previous incident where the bridge was blown up made her aware that Phoebe and Whitney had explosives in their possession, so she naturally had to be more cautious.</p></div>
