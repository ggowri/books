        <h1>Chapter 3729</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the fact that he knew the door lock password to her room made it natural for him to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you come here?" She stood up abruptly and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just came over since I had free time," he said. "Don't you like seeing me come over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" She quickly replied, "It's just that when you come over... um, you could give me a heads up in advance, so I can be mentally prepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you need to be mentally prepared?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." Veronica was speechless for a moment. Well, whatever. "It's nothing, it's okay if you don't give me a heads up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her and asked after a moment, "What are you doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" She was taken aback, only then noticing his gaze on the sewing machine. "I'm planning to make two pillows."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pillows?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we only have two pillows at home, which is not enough. I plan to make two more. I got some scrap fabric from the flea market today, as well as the cotton stuffing for the pillows. Do you think this fabric looks good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a bit puzzled and asked, "Why make them? Can't we just buy them directly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want, I can make it cheaper, and you can also choose the fabric you like," she said. "Anyway, this is a quick job."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she sat back down. Her sewing machine was an old-fashioned one that her mother had used before she passed away. After her mother's death, she tried to imitate her mother's style and use the sewing machine to mend things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Veronica skillfully press the pedal of the sewing machine and the needle fall onto the fabric she had already cut, Mason's mind flashed back to his childhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he was found by the Reed family, life was not easy for him and Veronica. When his clothes were torn or too short, she would help him mend them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only two years older than him, she struggled to press the pedal of the sewing machine with one foot while maintaining her balance with the other, using the old sewing machine to mend his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the sound of the needle falling, at some point, became a beautiful sound in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later, after the Reed family found him, she no longer needed to mend his clothes, and the old sewing machine never appeared in the Barlow family's new house again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never thought he would hear that sound again after so many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica finished making the pillowcase and looked up, she found Mason sitting in a chair next to her, leaning against the back of the chair, his hands resting on the corner of the chair back, supporting his chin, and his eyes closed, as if he were asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He... fell asleep?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica walked up to him, looked at Mason, and couldn't help but raise her hand and gently brush his bangs off his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyelashes trembled, and he slowly opened his eyes, his pitch-black pupils staring at her quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you tired? Do you want to rest in my bed for a while?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not tired, just closing my eyes so I can hear the sound more clearly," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What sound are you listening to?" she asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The sound of the sewing machine is very pleasant," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but laugh, remembering that he had said such things when they were children. "Then when I step on the sewing machine, you can listen to it more," he had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," he replied, gently pulling her hand down from his forehead and rubbing it against his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he had forgotten about their relationship, his body still instinctively longed for something. "Let's go on a date," he said, the words coming out of his mouth without him even realizing it.</span></p></div>
