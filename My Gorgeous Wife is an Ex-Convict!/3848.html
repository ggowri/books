        <h1>Chapter 3846</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you thought it through?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've actually wanted to cut ties with them for a long time," Veronica said. "But I'm worried that if I really do cut ties with them, it might have some negative impact on the Reed family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she would marry Mason in the future, and cutting ties with her family before marrying into a wealthy family could be interpreted by others as snobbish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't care about others' misunderstandings of her, but she was afraid it would bring a bad influence on the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So in this regard, she was also in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really want to do it, just do it. Don't worry about anything else. The Reed family will handle it, and there won't be any trouble," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? " Veronica still had doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this kind of thing causes trouble for the Reed family, how could they have been established in Emerald City for so many years? Don't worry. When the time comes, tell your father and stepmother. If they have any crooked ideas, they will naturally suffer the consequences. But I'm afraid you'll be too soft-hearted by then," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soft-hearted? Veronica frowned. How could she be soft-hearted towards such a father and stepmother!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Veronica didn't expect that the next day after talking to Mason, her father </span><span>and stepmother would be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because too many things had happened during this period, and the place where she worked had taken too many days off, the personnel at the brokerage company had "tactfully" asked her to handle the handover procedures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, companies like this usually have one person for one job. If she takes a long leave, the company will inevitably recruit new employees to complete her work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica resigned from the company and had just walked a few steps out of the door when she was surrounded by a group of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are Veronica, right? Archer and Rosalind are your parents, right?" The leader said maliciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica pursed her lips and did not answer directly, guessing who these people were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's no use denying it. We have already inquired. You are Veronica. Your parents owe us 30 million. They said you have the 'ability' to repay the money. I'm quite curious, what kind of ability do you have? Is it a special kind of 'ability'?" The other party said with insinuation, full of vulgar language.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other party hinted at something with his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica frowned. "They owe the money, so they should repay it. I never said I would help them repay it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this was indeed something her father and stepmother would do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A daughter should repay her father's debts, it's only right and proper!" the other party threatened, "I advise you to prepare 30 million as soon as possible, otherwise our brothers won't be easy to deal with. What you'll have to pay won't just be 30 million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica sneered, "Do you think I, someone who works at a brokerage firm, can afford to pay 30 million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems you won't cry until you see the coffin. Fine! We'll take a few pictures of you without clothes on. If you don't want those pictures to be seen by people you know, then prepare the money properly." The other party signaled to his henchmen, "Get them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, she was just a weak and helpless woman. On their side, there were several men. Dealing with a woman like her should have been easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what they didn't expect was that just as they were about to subdue Veronica, two men suddenly appeared from the side and attacked them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, their skills were extraordinary. In just two short minutes, they had already knocked down several of them.</span></p></div>
