        <h1>Chapter 164</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Aunt's words were nothing more than her trying to justify Uncle and the others' actions and clear their names.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, no matter what they had been saying at that moment, Grace acted as if she hadn't heard them at all. She only stared at her grandmother lying on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She only cared about her grandma.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, her grandma's mouth seemed to move as if she was stuttering something while in a coma.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace put her head close to her grandma's lips, her body suddenly froze. The words that came out of her mouth were the names of her uncle, second uncle, and third aunt.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace silently straightened her body and walked out of the ward. Uncle and Second Uncle followed her and wanted to make her promise to drop the case.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace said coldly, "Why would I drop the case? Since you don't think of me as your family, why should I treat you like mine?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You ungrateful swine, how can you let your grandma down?" Her aunt said gruffly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Whether or not I let grandma down is my business. At least I haven't done anything wrong to you. Instead, it's your husband and son who owe me for the things they did. Otherwise, they wouldn't be locked up right now!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her aunt was so angry that she choked and couldn't say a word.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace left the hospital on her own. Aunt wanted to chase after her, but Second Aunt stopped her. "Don't mess with her. The big shot is protecting her, so we can't afford to offend her. If she really gets angry, she'll extend the sentences of our imprisoned family members. What will we do then?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How dare she!" Aunt shouted in rage.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey, before you ask about whether she dares to or not, do you think you can go all out against her? By then, you will be arrested in the police station as well!" Second Aunt said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Aunt shrank back. She was angry and scared, but she didn't dare to chase after Grace anymore.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace took a taxi and went back to Emerald City. She spent almost half of the night on the road, and by the time she returned to Emerald City, the sky was already starting to brighten.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't sleep all night. At five o'clock in the morning, she started sweeping the road again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Claire looked at Grace and said, "Grace, you didn't sleep well last night? You are not in good spirits."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mm," Grace responded half-heartedly, thinking about her grandma. Her uncle and the others wouldn't be released even if she were to drop the case at the police station.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she really wanted to release them, then Jason was the key!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she thought of Jason, she felt a sudden tightness in her heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had already rejected his request for her to stay by his side. He had clearly been angry when that had happened.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, was she going to go and beg him again?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Will he agree?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he didn't agree, then it would be difficult for her grandma to meet uncle and the others in the future. It was even possible that... her sons and daughter wouldn't be there to see her off on her deathbed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew that her grandma still cared about Uncle and the others! But because her grandmother didn't want Grace to be hurt, she deliberately didn't plead in front of Uncle and the others.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grandma wanted to get justice for her, but she could not accept it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she could untie the knot in her grandma's heart and have her recover from this illness, she could give up on the justice she deserved!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At noon, Grace held her cell phone and looked at the number on it. This number... was the number she had applied for after buying a phone for Jay.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't know whether he was still using the number.</p></div>
