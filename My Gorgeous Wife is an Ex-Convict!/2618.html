        <h1>Chapter 2616</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she hesitated. Moments later, she grabbed her bag and took out a post-it note and a pen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her head down, she drew a cartoon on the paper and handed it to Brian. "Here, take this. I hope you'll feel happier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced at the post-it note in front of him. Although the cartoon on the paper was made up of only a few strokes, it captured the characteristics of his appearance. Especially those phoenix eyes, which made people know it was him at a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cartoon was beaming, but... it had been a long time since he laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know what on earth you're going through. But when you get over it and look back at it, you'll find that it's nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's nothing?' He pressed his thin lips together slightly. 'She has no idea what I'm going through!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;But I have no choice but to get over it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes stared at the woman in front of him. If it was not Grace, it did not matter who it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you be my girlfriend?" the melodious voice rang in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was intending to leave as she got up and grabbed her bag, but she was so stunned by the question that she froze. Her round eyes blinked. She was seriously wondering if she had heard wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have a boyfriend?" his voice continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there someone you like, then?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you be my girlfriend? You can tell me whatever you want in exchange for that," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if something was stuck in her throat. 'Did I... hear that right? Does he really want me to be his girlfriend? But the problem is, does a guy like him lack women? With his looks, he just has to shout and many women will want to become his girlfriend.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you want me... to be your girlfriend?" she asked blankly. The way he looked at her eyes was indifferent and estranged. There was no love in those phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because it makes no difference to me who I choose to be my girlfriend. If you're unwilling, you can refuse," he said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if it made no difference to him whether she accepted or rejected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heartbeat raced. 'Should I refuse him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Any person would refuse, but the refusal seemed stuck in her throat. She was unable to utter it no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller returned to her studio from the small restaurant, still in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Have I... become that person's girlfriend?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She became his girlfriend the second time they met. She would be considered to have lost her mind if she told anyone about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even wondered if his family had been urging him to get married, so he wanted to find a girlfriend suddenly. However, the man replied, "My family's indeed urging me to get married, but I wouldn't get a girlfriend because of that."</p></div>
