        <h1>Chapter 3903</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she had mentally prepared for the pain before entering the delivery room, she only knew how severe the pain was when she was actually giving birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When her mother gave birth to her, she must have experienced this kind of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her consciousness seemed to be gradually becoming blurred, and the voices of doctors and nurses around her seemed to be drifting away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All her strength was gradually fading away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica! I won't let anything happen to you, absolutely not!" That familiar voice roared in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who is shouting?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica opened her eyes wide, but her vision was blurry, and she couldn't even focus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, you find a way to get the baby out of her body. Even if the baby dies, it doesn't matter. I just want my wife to live!" The voice continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was... Mason's voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, how could he say that it doesn't matter if the baby dies? They were clearly looking forward to it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No... it's not possible!" Veronica gasped, struggling to keep herself from falling asleep and staying awake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The baby can't... have any problems. I will... give birth to this baby safely..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was the mother of the child, and now the only person who could ensure the safe birth of this child was her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only person the child could rely on was her, the mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Almost using up her last bit of strength, she gathered her courage...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, something seemed to leave her body, and then she heard the baby's cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is... her child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her child, born safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt as if she was soaked in sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had exerted all her strength just now, and now she felt weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes slowly regained focus, and Veronica finally saw Mason kneeling beside her delivery bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But tears covered his familiar face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And his black eyes seemed to be soaked in tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you crying?" she murmured, her throat dry and hoarse from the earlier screams during delivery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because I was so worried about you," he said in a low voice, sounding choked up. When she was about to pass out, he was really afraid that she wouldn't make it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afraid that he would lose her like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry for making you worry," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to raise her hand to wipe away the tears on his face, but she had no strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It should be me who's sorry for making you suffer so much," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As long as the child is safe... any amount of suffering is worth it," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the nurse had finished examining the newborn baby, who was wrapped in a small blanket and covered in thick amniotic fluid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Congratulations, it's a girl, weighing 3200 grams," the nurse held the baby and showed her to Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at her daughter's rosy cheeks. At the moment, the baby's face was still puffy, and her eyes were closed. It was impossible to tell who she looked like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But looking at this little life, a warm feeling surged in Veronica's heart. This was her and Mason's child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From now on, she would accompany this child to grow up, and this child would accompany her to grow old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's wonderful," Veronica murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The nurse held the baby and brought her close to Veronica's cheek.</p></div>
