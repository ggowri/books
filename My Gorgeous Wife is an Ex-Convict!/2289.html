        <h1>Chapter 2287</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only felt her heart racing at that moment. Her eyes watered, while her lips that his fingers were still pressing against seemed to be getting hotter and hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm going to the washroom!" she said hurriedly. However, instead of going to the washroom in the ward, she quickly walked outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt that if she stayed in there any longer, she would probably burst out in tears in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She rarely cried since her imprisonment. She always told herself to be strong. Tears were pointless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had been pushed to tears several times these days because of Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla ran to the washroom at the end of the hallway, intending to wipe her face with cold water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice came from behind her. "Miss Corbyn, can we talk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked up, only to see Mrs. Weiss reflected in the mirror above the sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned to look at her. "Aunt, you want to talk to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, there's something I need to talk to you about, but this isn't a good place to talk. Why don't we talk in the empty examination room next door?" said Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not refuse and followed Mrs. Weiss to the empty room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss locked the door and said to Kyla, "Miss Corbyn, I know you and Martin have a lot of history and you&rsquo;re now carrying Martin's baby. Just as Martin said, it was only natural for him to have saved you when you were in danger, but... I hope you can let him go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze, "Aunt, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've begged you to be with Martin, but you refused. You said you didn&rsquo;t love him and that your marriage was just a matter of expediency. I beg you to make him give up on you once and for all, okay? Martin can risk his life for you, but there's no way you can risk your life for him. Otherwise, it would have been you in the hospital today instead of him, right?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. She could not even refute Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn, I've lost my husband. I don't want to lose my only son too. You donated him your bone marrow, but he also gave you part of his liver. He has been suffering all these years, and this time, he almost died! Perhaps some people aren't just meant to be. Look, the more involved you are, the more likely there are to be accidents. Why don't you just make him give up on you for good? Perhaps he can only start over after giving up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss sobbed. All she felt at the moment was fear that she would lose her only son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she still had to beg Kyla even if she was dissatisfied with her. She knew it would only work if Kyla was willing to do so. If Kyla refused to let her son go, Martin could never be able to get over this relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only felt a boulder pressing on her chest. Every word Mrs. Weiss uttered pressed down on her, leaving her breathless. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn, I beg you to let Martin live! Your two children are the flesh and blood of the Weiss family. It's up to you if you want your children to stay with you or let them return to the Weiss family. You can ask for money or assets. I'll give you anything I can. I just want Martin to be alive and well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... won't hurt him. I... I want him to be safe and well too," said Kyla.</p></div>
