        <h1>Chapter 4104</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt heartache for all the suffering Chandler had gone through. Originally, she was supposed to marry him when she became an adult. At that time, the elders on Hunter's side thought they should get married as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Chandler insisted on getting married after she graduated from college.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, she simply thought that Chandler wanted her to be clearer about her feelings before marrying him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now she realized that it wasn't that simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler gave her time, which meant that he would suffer for a longer time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And what if she changed her mind? What if she decided not to marry Chandler? Has he not thought about what he would do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about this, Tina felt even more pain in her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe she should go find Chandler today and have a good talk with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Tina passed by a certain alley, she saw several girls blocking a few people and shouting, "Wow, we really blocked them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's take a group photo! And we want your autograph too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, don't leave! We've been waiting here for so long, how can you just leave like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, you have to sign and take a photo with us before you go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right, we're your fans! As an idol, you can't treat your fans like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit was protected by several bodyguards and assistants, so these fans couldn't get close to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was already feeling unwell, but he had to attend the event because it had been arranged in advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the event, he came out from a small side door of the mall and was surprised to find fans waiting for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at this moment, he really didn't have the energy to sign autographs and take photos with fans. He even felt a little dizzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the bodyguards blocked a fan who was trying to rush towards Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fan stumbled and fell on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the fan shouted, "Wow, Kit hit a fan! We came to support him, but the bodyguards hit us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fan's friends also spoke up, "You're just an idol, why are you acting like a big shot? We just want your autograph and photo, and you treat us like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right! You have to give us an explanation, or we'll expose this and let others judge!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit frowned. If the situation escalated, it wouldn't be good for him. At this point, it would be better to appease these fans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's just a signature and a photo, if he can hold on a little longer and handle these fans, he can finally go back and rest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was about to speak, suddenly, a voice spoke up faster than him, "Let me set things straight. I clearly saw that this fan insisted on rushing over, was stopped by the bodyguards, and then fell down because she couldn't stand steady."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, everyone's gaze turned towards Tina, who had walked into the alley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit was stunned when he saw Tina.</p></div>
