        <h1>Chapter 4043</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Miss Fowler nodded repeatedly, tears in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, she just pitied Nancy and did everything she could to save her, knowing that every life was precious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But who could have thought that she would receive such a reward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she had no children of her own, she now had Nancy's child, which was worth it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At one of the tables at the wedding banquet sat Grace's friend Lina and her family, including their daughter Tina, who is now a 20-year-old young woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina's appearance is a blend of Lina and Hadwin's features. Her oval face and dark round eyes, tied up in a simple ponytail, make her look cute and lovely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There is a hint of elegance in her eyebrows, but her eyes soften that elegance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, if she were to enhance her eyes with eyeliner to make them look narrower, it would highlight that elegance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Recently, Tina has taken a liking to cosplay. Because of her height, which is 170cm, she cross-dresses as a man, and she can't get enough of it, thanks to her friends' encouragement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, Tina has been doing well in this circle. Whenever she has free time, she takes a few cosplay photos or videos and posts them online, and she has gained quite a few fans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Tina's personality is completely different from the beautiful men she cosplays as.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the words of her friend Eugenia Massy, if Tina's fans knew what her true personality was like, half of them would probably be disappointed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The real Tina is nothing like the characters she cosplays as, who are either cold, arrogant, or crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead... she loves beautiful people, regardless of gender. For Tina, as long as they are beautiful, that's all that matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And once she gets to know a beautiful person, she likes to tease them. Eugenia herself has not escaped Tina's clutches and has been teased by her countless times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Eugenia has gotten used to it over time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina also likes to have a crush on beautiful people. Even though she already has a stunning fianc&eacute; like Chandler by her side, she still likes to idolize celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia once said, "If God gave me an unmarried husband like Chandler, I wouldn't look at any other man."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Tina replied, "Wouldn't that be too boring? Beauty is meant to be appreciated in abundance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you afraid your fianc&eacute; will get jealous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chandler is very understanding, he can handle it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Understand my ass!" Eugenia thought to herself. In Eugenia's eyes, Chandler was extremely good-looking and treated Tina well, but deep down...well, he was sly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of man could only be a friend. If he became an enemy, it would be too scary!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Chandler ever started to care, Tina would probably suffer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the moment, Eugenia was sending messages to Tina, reminding her, "Don't forget to get Kit's autograph for me. If you don't get it for me, we're done tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit was a member of a new idol group and also Eugenia's current favorite idol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit's real name was Kit Ingram, and his family was also a prominent one. He was invited to attend the Reed family's wedding, so Eugenia asked Tina to get his autograph for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Got it, don't worry. I want Kit's autograph for myself too!" Tina replied to her friend's message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thanks, sis. But aren't you afraid Chandler will get jealous if you also get Kit's autograph?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha, impossible. If Chandler really gets jealous, I want to see it!" Tina replied.</p></div>
