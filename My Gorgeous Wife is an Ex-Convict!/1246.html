        <h1>Chapter 1245</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With the Reed family's wealth, even if the babies were born premature, they would receive the best care, so their chances of survival were much higher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But have you ever thought about what will happen to your body?" His voice rose unconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I&rsquo;m going to take a risk anyway, I want to risk it with my kids. I'm their mommy. Why should they take the risk while I'm safe and sound?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He froze when he heard the word &lsquo;mommy&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mother had left him behind when he was badly injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the woman in front of him was going to risk her life for her children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's a very different person from my mother... She would be a good mommy if she became one, and our kids won't be like me, will they?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I really want to keep these three children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can say that I'm too idealistic or that I'm too emotional and irrational, but... you don't know how desperate I was when the doctors told me I would never be able to conceive. I was afraid I would end up alone in the world without even a family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But now that I finally have three children, three more family members who are related to me by blood, I really... can't give up a single one. I know it&rsquo;ll be risky, but I want to fight for them. I want to fight for myself and the children!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told him everything on her mind, holding nothing back. There was a determination in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'd risk your life for the children, wouldn't you?" His voice rang faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" she answered him without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you..." His voice broke off, and the rest of the words got stuck in his throat. He did not go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it?" She blinked her eyes in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing." Jason looked away. For a moment, he had the impulse to ask her if she would risk her life for him too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he expecting something? Expecting her to do the same for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she was willing to stay with him and work on the marriage with him, it was only for the children and to give the children a happy family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's late. It's time for bed. We'll talk about the babies when we go to the hospital tomorrow!" Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They did not turn off the lights. The two lay on the bed as the soft light filled the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew Jason was indulging her by leaving the lights on to let her sleep.</p></div>
