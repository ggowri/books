        <h1>Chapter 3183</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The specific date of the wedding was determined by the Hart family. It is said to be an auspicious day that the Hart family specifically consulted a master in the temple to calculate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On Valda's side, the comic has finally resumed serialization, and the rehabilitation of her legs is also going well. When she walks, the degree of turning is getting smaller and everything is developing in a positive direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At noon, Brian came to her studio to pick her up for lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just need to finish up a few loose ends, then I'll be ready. Can you wait for me a moment?" said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Brian responded naturally and sat down on the nearby sofa. His eyes, resembling those of a phoenix, gazed at Valda who was busy drawing on her computer with an electronic pen. It was clear that he was accustomed to waiting like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was completely absorbed in painting, as if at this moment, all her attention was focused on the painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian took out his phone and secretly aimed the camera lens at Valda. He then pressed the button and took several pictures of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she was unaware of his secret photography, and she didn't even know that most of the photos in his phone album were of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every night, he would look at these photos one by one, gazing at her face before he could fall asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Valda finished her painting and looked up, she saw Brian staring at her with such deep affection that it seemed as if it would overflow like water... Perhaps this is what they mean by "gentle as water".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're looking at me like that, I'm going to feel embarrassed," Valda said. Fortunately, her assistant didn't come to work today, so she was alone in the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If there were other people around at this moment, she would probably be even more embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled and walked over to her, "Then you're only allowed to feel embarrassed in front of me, got it?" He didn't want other men to see her shy and timid side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her beauty was enough for him to see alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his words, she became even more embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's go eat," he leaned down, kissed her cheek, and then rubbed her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh-huh," she replied softly, her face turning even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you want to eat today?" he asked after they got in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anything will do," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he drove and took her to a restaurant not far from her studio to have a meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It is an elegant Cantonese restaurant. Valda and Brian entered the restaurant and Brian requested a private room. After ordering their food, Valda said, "I need to use the restroom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll accompany you," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was a bit amused and helpless, "It's just a restroom, I can go by myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll accompany you," he insisted with a serious look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pursed her lips for a moment before saying, "I know you're afraid that something might happen to me. There was one time before when I went to the restroom alone and something unexpected happened. But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda paused for a moment and said, "But Brian, you can't be by my side 24/7. Accidents can happen at any time, just like how parents are afraid that their children might choke on water, trip while walking, or choke while eating... But we can't stop children from doing these things. There are many things that people have to face and do alone. So, I can go to the bathroom by myself!"</p></div>
