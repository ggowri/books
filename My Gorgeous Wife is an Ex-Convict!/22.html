        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After losing face in the club, Greg was beaten into the hospital by his father, who valued business over family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even so, several of the Anders family's businesses related to the Reed Group had been affected. For the Anders family, the loss could not be said to be small.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The people who took part in the alumni gathering that day either lost their jobs or their families suffered. In short, every single person who ignored Grace&rsquo;s plight paid the price for it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Mia Jemerged from the personnel department, both of her legs were trembling, and she could barely stand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The personnel department directly gave her a termination letter, saying that they would dismiss her and let her finish the resignation formalities within a week.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Dismissed! She had never thought about it before.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her family had expended a lot of effort to get her into the Urban Management Bureau. It had not been easy for them to pull so many connections to secure her such a job. What&rsquo;s worse, she&rsquo;d been on a series of dates and blind dates, and her job was an advantage. She&rsquo;d been elevated by the political position that she&rsquo;d been afforded at the Urban Management Bureau. One of those guys caught wind that she&rsquo;d been fired&hellip; it was doubtful they&rsquo;d want to continue pursuing her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she was dismissed like this, not only would it be hard to find a new job, but also she would lose face in front of her relatives and friends. And her family&hellip;would be devastated.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she asked the personnel department why they had fired her or what exactly she had done wrong, the staff simply said, "It's an order from the superiors. You'll be given compensation for the dismissal, but you'll never be employed here again."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mia panicked and called Maria. "Maria, what should I do? I'm being let go from the Urban Management Bureau. You... Didn't you say that you have good relations here? Can you help me think of a way? Find someone who's on good terms with our director and plead for me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Usually, since Mia was obedient enough, Maria would be willing to help her. They&rsquo;d been friends a long time, and there were few people Maria trusted. Mia had proven her loyalty over the years. But at this time, Maria couldn&rsquo;t care less about Mia. She had her own problems to contend with.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maria could not even protect her own family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The bank loan that had originally been agreed upon was suddenly rejected, and the family's capital flow was about to stagnate. As she took this call, her whole family was scrambling to borrow money from people.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, they were in trouble. No one wanted to lend them a dime. And she knew their names had been tarnished&mdash;in ways they might not recover from.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maria held the phone away from her ear as Mia prattled on.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Damn it, her family was on the verge of bankruptcy. She didn&rsquo;t have time for this.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can't help you. Go find someone else!" Maria said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You... How can you say that? I've always done everything you've asked me to. You said that you wanted me to lure Grace into the private room for the alumni event. I did it, and I didn't hesitate at all. Now, I'm asking you for your help with something, and you refuse!?"</p></div>
