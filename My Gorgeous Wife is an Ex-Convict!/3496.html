        <h1>Chapter 3494</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry for dragging you into this," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay. We were both kidnapped together. If it was just one of us, it would have been even scarier," Jasper said. "But I was useless and you had to protect me and distract the kidnappers. They were after you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, luckily Mason arrived in time," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, luckily I met Mason!" Mason stuck out his tongue and said, "By the way, are you and I, Mason, okay now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper smiled, "In that case, Mason won't be in a bad mood all the time, but... does that mean he's going to stay at your house?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Mason and Veronica have made up and she is happy about it, she feels a sense of loss in her heart when she thinks about Mason leaving the Reed family to live with the Barlow family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback, she hadn't thought about this question before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in the end, when she was discharged, Veronica did not return to the Barlow family. Instead, she stayed with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to Grace, Veronica is the only one who has experienced this kind of thing, and since the case is still unsolved, it's possible that there are still kidnappers out there who haven't been caught.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the kidnappers seek revenge against Veronica, she will be safer staying with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Veronica has just been discharged from the hospital, and there are members of the Reed family who can take care of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the Reed family's side, Veronica's room has already been arranged right next to Mason's room. The bedding and other essentials in the room are also brand new.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at this bedroom, Veronica couldn't help but admire the efficiency of the Reed family. From her kidnapping to hospitalization, it only took them a day to set up such a bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If there's anything else that needs to be replaced, just let me know," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't need anything else, this is good enough," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you rest here for a while. If you need anything, I'll have Mason go to the Barlow family and bring it over for you later," Grace added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I can go back by myself." Veronica quickly said, "Actually, my injury is not that serious and it doesn't affect my ability to walk. Besides... um, there are some things that are not convenient for Mason to help me carry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For example... your own underwear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, Veronica's face blushed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace seemed to have realized something and smiled, saying, "Okay, let Mason accompany you to get it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it was said that Mason accompanied Veronica to the Barlow family to pick up some of her usual items, but in reality, they were also accompanied by the bodyguard of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the two returned to the Barlow family's home, there was no one there. Veronica took some of her personal belongings and replacement clothes, which were only some close-fitting clothes. She put them in a drawer under the wardrobe, which required her to bend down to retrieve them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was about to bend down, a hand was placed on her waist to stop her movement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You have injuries on your waist and back, don't bend over. What do you need? I'll help you get it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face turned red involuntarily. How could she let him help her carry it? "I can do it myself," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he insisted, saying, "I'll take it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them stared at each other for a while, and finally Veronica spoke up again, "You can't take the things inside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know, it's your personal clothing, right?" he said. "I won't look, I can take it with my eyes closed. In a moment, I'll take the clothing out of the drawer, you can take what you need and put it away, and then I'll put the rest back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he didn't wait for her to respond. He closed his eyes and bent down to open the drawer.</p></div>
