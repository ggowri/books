        <h1>Chapter 2658</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought she would not sleep well the whole night after the washroom scare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she woke up the next morning to a call from her studio assistant. She realized she had been sleeping like a log. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant thought something had happened to her when she did not show up, but it turned out she had just overslept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller quickly got out of bed to wash up after hanging up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Last night, she only remembered holding Brian's hand tightly as she entered the house. Then, Brian offered to pour her a glass of hot water. Later, she was leaning on the couch and was unable to resist the urge to take a nap...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did I fall asleep? And... did Brian carry me to bed?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face immediately reddened at the thought of it. 'I didn't do or say anything weird after falling asleep, did I?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she vaguely remembered a soft voice saying something in her sleep. Then... she slept so soundly... so, so soundly...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked up at herself in the mirror in front of the sink. In the mirror, her cheeks were red, and her eyes seemed to sparkle with some longing...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, is it hard to pretend to love me?" His voice seemed to ring in her ears again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart seemed to beat faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh! Stop thinking about it!' Valda Theller shook her head. She and Brian were only pretending to date. There was nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had feelings for someone else, and she knew that very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she knew better than anyone not to fall for the man. It might be another disaster if she fell for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After reaching the studio, Valda Theller and her two assistants sorted out various materials related to Meeting You.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The drama was about to start filming. The director said yesterday that he hoped that she, the original comic artist, could come to the set at a fixed time every week. They could discuss the script as soon as possible if they needed to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although they had written the script, it could be changed at any time during filming. The film might be more <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>authentic if she participated in the process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had no objections to it. She wanted what was best for the film too. Besides, she happened to be free during this period. Her next comic was still in the plot development stage and had not been serialized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she started serializing the comic, she would not have much spare time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Valda Theller was sorting out the materials, her phone suddenly rang. Valda Theller pressed the answer button, and her best friend Camille Strickland's anxious voice came from the phone. "Valda, where are you now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The studio," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, hurry and put on a hat. Leave the studio as inconspicuously as possible. Ask your assistants to go home too. In short, lock the studio up and don't leave anyone inside," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? What happened?" Valda Theller asked.</p></div>
