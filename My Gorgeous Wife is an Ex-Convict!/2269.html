        <h1>Chapter 2267</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately knew that it was a dagger pressing against her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert's hysterical voice rang in her ears. "No one is allowed to come near us. I&rsquo;ll kill her if you do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other two young men kept saying, "This has nothing to do with us! He's the mastermind. He made us do this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes were covered, so she could see nothing and only hear what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A familiar voice suddenly rang out in the room. "Okay, don't hurt her. I won't let them go near you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla trembled. It was... Martin Weiss's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert gasped, but the dagger in his hand pressed harder on Kyla's neck. Pain instantly spread more intensely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla whispered a cry of pain, and Martin Weiss snapped nervously. "Don't hurt her! You'll pay for it if anything happens to her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, you don't want me to hurt her? Tell these police to f*ck off, and I want 200 million USD wired into my foreign bank account. Also, prepare two million dollars in cash and a car. I'll let her go when I feel safe," Mr. Lambert said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "No matter what company I manage, I can&rsquo;t just come up with 200 million dollars in cash just like that. It takes time to prepare the money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll only give you half an hour. If I don&rsquo;t get the money half an hour later, then I&rsquo;ll just die with this woman," said Mr. Lambert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay. You're not allowed to hurt her in the next half an hour!" Martin Weiss said firmly. After getting the bank account that Mr. Lambert wanted him to transfer the money to, he called his secretary in front of Mr. Lambert and ordered him to gather the funds within half an hour before depositing the sum into the designated account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had also talked to the police. They would prepare the car and cash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Her neck is bleeding. Here's gauze. You can have your men stop the bleeding for her." Martin Weiss's voice rang out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert suddenly laughed. "Stop the bleeding? Okay, kneel to me first. I'll stop her bleeding once I'm satisfied with your kneeling."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyone could tell that Mr. Lambert had no intention of stopping Kyla's bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla then heard a thump on the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt her heart quiver. &lsquo;Is Martin Weiss... kneeling?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she heard Mr. Lambert's laugh, which seemed to have given her the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hahaha... Martin Weiss, I didn't expect this to ever happen to you! Weren't you so smug and arrogant before this? What's the matter? Are you willing to kneel just for a b*tch? But you hit me back then, so hit yourself with the stick next to you as many times as you hit me back then!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss!" someone nearby exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;m the one making this decision. The police won't be held accountable," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Kyla heard the strike of the stick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finally shouted, "No! Martin Weiss, no!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her neck moved as she shouted. The bleeding in her neck grew worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, don't speak," said Martin Weiss. The sound of a stick landing severely on someone&rsquo;s body continued to ring out.</p></div>
