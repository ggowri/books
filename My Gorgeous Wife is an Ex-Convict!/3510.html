        <h1>Chapter 3508</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel raised his fist, wanting to punch Mason, but Mason dodged and Lionel ended up hitting a nearby shelf. Suddenly, things on the shelf fell to the ground, making a loud noise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, the door of the room was suddenly pushed open and Rosalind rushed in. Seeing her son lying on the ground, buried under a pile of debris, she quickly ran over and pulled him up, anxiously asking, "Are you okay? Does it hurt? Is it serious?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Lionel seemed to ignore him and struggled to rush to Mason again. "Mason, you can't just turn your back on me after benefiting from kidnapping my sister and leaving me to take the blame. It's all because of you! If it weren't for you, I would never have kidnapped my sister! And you knew why I did it, why didn't you go to the police station to help me explain earlier?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rosalind also hurriedly spoke up for her son, "Yes, Mason, Lionel did all this because of you! You can't let him go to jail! If the judge finds out that you're involved in the kidnapping case, you won't be able to escape either..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer, who was standing aside, immediately changed his expression and quickly stopped his wife, "Enough, you're going too far!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rosalind realized that she had misspoken and immediately stuttered, not daring to speak again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Mason seemed to pay no attention to what they were saying. At this moment, his gaze was fixed on Veronica, who was standing by the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that she had also heard those words. What would she think about it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, his heart was beating rapidly with anxiety. Her silence suddenly made him feel afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be that she also believed in the kidnapping and thought that he was involved and knew about it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She must believe in him! At that moment, he said to himself in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica..." He walked step by step towards her. "Did you hear everything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stared at the person in front of her for a while before saying, "Yes, I heard everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you believe me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Believe you about what?" she asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Before you believe me, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with this kidnapping," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica suddenly felt a sourness in her nose. She really wanted to believe him, but Lionel's words from earlier kept replaying in her mind, causing too many doubts to arise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it really not related to you? Then tell me, why were you the first to find the warehouse where the kidnappers were located that day? You said you got a clue, so what was the clue? Was it a text message from Lionel?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I never received any text message. I had actually blocked his number, so it was impossible for me to receive any messages..." he hurriedly tried to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why is that?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's..." he hesitated, his gaze falling on the pendant of her necklace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now is definitely not a good time to bring this up. If he does, she might hate him again and give him the cold shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if he doesn't say anything, she might think that he and Lionel were the ones who planned the kidnapping from the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, his hesitation at this moment is seen as an admission of guilt by her.</p></div>
