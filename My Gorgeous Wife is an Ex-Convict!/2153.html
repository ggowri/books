        <h1>Chapter 2151</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did more than what was necessary today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, how can you still be so stupid after all these years?" he murmured to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a long time before he started the car. He drove aimlessly on the streets of Emerald City. It was not until night fell and the moon was high in the sky that he realized he had driven to the store&rsquo;s entrance again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The door was closed, and only the light pouring from the windows showed that the occupants were still awake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss got out of the car but did not walk to the store. Instead, he leaned against the door and stood there quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Kyla went to draw the curtains before going to bed, she happened to see Martin Weiss standing beside the car outside the window. She could not help freezing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, moments later, she drew the curtains and ignored the person outside the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was better if she and Martin Weiss saw less of each other!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla turned around, picked up the cream for bruises in the medical kit, undressed her son, and applied the cream on her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson had a lot of bruises on his small frame from his training recently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was getting a lot more bruises compared to when he went to learn taekwondo. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Every time she saw the bruises on her son, Kyla could not help but advise her son to give up and switch back to taekwondo. It could strengthen his body too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Nelson insisted on learning what he was currently learning despite the number of injuries he got. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mommy, the coach says I'm more agile than before. When I'm stronger, I'll be able to protect you and my sister!" said Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla could not help smiling. "How do you know that I'm carrying a girl? What if it's a boy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If it's a boy, I&rsquo;ll protect him too. But I&rsquo;ll teach him kung fu and make him strong as well," replied Nelson Corbyn. Then, he looked carefully at Kyla's belly. "But I still think you're carrying a girl."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla laughed. Speaking of which, she had hoped for a son and a daughter before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"By the way, Mommy, when am I going to see Aunt Lina and her baby?" Nelson Corbyn had wanted to see the baby since learning that Lina had given birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina had been in a coma in the hospital earlier. Kyla did not tell the little one about it. She just told him Aunt Lina and the baby needed to rest quietly and that it was inconvenient for so many people to visit them in the hospital. They could only go there after some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll take you to see Aunt Lina and the baby in a few days. Aunt Lina will be happy to see you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn replied, "Okay, I&rsquo;ll protect Tina and be a good brother to her too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After applying the medicine on her son, Kyla dressed him in his pajamas, covered him with a blanket, and lay down herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, a layer of thin sweat broke out on Kyla's forehead. Her brows furrowed tighter as she muttered something. Her head gradually moved from left to right as if she was trying to get out of something.</p></div>
