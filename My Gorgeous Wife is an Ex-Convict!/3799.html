        <h1>Chapter 3797</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because he is outstanding? So he is easily noticeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she saw him, he was looking down at his book and didn't lift his head, making it impossible to see his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or maybe it was because she loved him? Because she loved him so much, she remembered the contours of his body and all the details so clearly that she could easily spot him in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if sensing her gaze, he lifted his head and his beautiful black eyes met hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's body stiffened and for a moment, she didn't know how to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, on the other hand, looked surprised for a moment, then furrowed his brow and put away his book before standing up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica watched as Mason walked towards her, and she became increasingly nervous. Just as he reached her, she gathered her courage and spoke up, "Mason, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, he brushed past her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's body stiffened again, suddenly feeling like he was treating her like a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like when he had hypnotized away their feelings in the past and she had gone to find him, only to be treated like this. It was as if everything between them was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be... that he had hypnotized her again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, she turned around and chased after him, grabbing his sleeve. "Did you... hypnotize us again these past few days?" Her lips trembled as she asked the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied expressionlessly, "Let go of me. I don't want to talk to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm asking you, did you hypnotize me again?" She didn't let go of his hand and stared straight into his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I did or not is none of your business. Don't forget, we've already broken up," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, does breaking up mean you can erase everything that happened between us?" Veronica asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them were standing in the hallway of the library, and their confrontation had already caught the attention of some people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else can we do? Do we have to keep thinking about everything from the past after we break up?" Mason said. "I don't plan on being watched by people here, so you better let go quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to find you today, not afraid of being watched," Veronica said. "Unless you </span><span>promise me to find a place to talk properly, I won't let go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his thin lips and stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her chin, her face showing a determined look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression made him recall the similar look she had in his memory. Although those emotions had already faded away, why were the memories related to her still so vivid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So vivid that he couldn't forget even if he wanted to!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I promise you," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica finally let go, and the two of them walked out of the library. Mason asked, "Where do you want to talk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My place," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, if there was a place where they wouldn't be disturbed, her home was a good choice. After all, she lived alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason didn't say anything, he just walked towards the parking lot, and Veronica followed behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they arrived at the parking lot and found Mason's car, his old phone rang. He took out his phone from his pocket and answered the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I got it. If the other party really wants to sue, then I can go to court... it doesn't matter," Mason said to the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica shuddered when she heard it. Sue? Go to court? Does it have something to do with Daniel?!</span></p></div>
