        <h1>Chapter 790</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the cake in her hand had fallen to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not far from the restaurant's door, a tall figure had stepped out of the car and was approaching her in the moonlight step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hair was still meticulously combed, and he was wearing a crisp suit. His cold and stern face gave people a sense of abstinence, while his deep and narrow eyes seemed to see through people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When you were stared at by those eyes, others could not help but feel scared as if they were being stared at by a beast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now those eyes were upon her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only felt that the blood vessels in her body seemed to have frozen suddenly, and the only thing left was the suffocating cold!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did the man finally appear in front of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps when she fled from the mall that day, she had a vague premonition that she might not escape him this time. He would eventually find her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I just didn't expect it to be... so soon!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything had happened too quickly that she felt breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s been a long time." A cold voice rang in the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body could not help but shiver. 'It&rsquo;s been a long time? Indeed, I haven&rsquo;t seen him for a long time, except for a glance at his profile at the mall the other day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When was the last time before that? Right, when he appeared in court as a witness and testified against my 'crime'.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used his testimony to push her into the depths of hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Kyla, make amends for your sins!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sins? What am I going to make amends for? I'm not guilty at all!' However, no matter how much she complained, he said she had &lsquo;sinned&rsquo;, so she needed to suffer for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I was really guilty, then my greatest sin was to have loved him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the man who sent her to prison said that it had been a long time. Subconsciously, she just wanted to get away from the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I want to get far away from him and never see him again!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla immediately walked to get past Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, only after two steps, her arm was gripped hard by a hand. "I haven't asked you to leave yet. Where are you going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened and turned to meet Martin Weiss's cold eyes. "Mr. Weiss, you don't seem to have the power to decide whether I can leave or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her, and the air around them seemed to be oppressive. "I haven't seen you in a few years, but you've become quite eloquent. Looks like you had good food in prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a light sentence, but it made Kyla feel like a sharp weapon had thrust into her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Good food?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does he know how hard it was for me to get a proper meal in prison?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does he know that when I was pregnant with Nelson, I was afraid that I didn't have enough to eat and the baby in my tummy would be malnourished, so I did many humiliating things in return for other people's leftovers?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does he know that after I gave birth to Nelson, I was so hungry that I couldn't even produce milk, so I could only let Nelson drink the crudest rice soup&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, he doesn't know any of this!'</p></div>
