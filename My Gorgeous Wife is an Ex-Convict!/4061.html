        <h1>Chapter 4059</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he was cooperating with all her movements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if at this moment, he wouldn't resist anything she did to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina kissed Chandler passionately, indulging in the moment...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know how long it had been until she felt like she couldn't breathe anymore, and finally pulled away from his lips, gasping for fresh air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you okay now?" Chandler asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes...I'm okay," Tina said, still feeling a bit unsatisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it was a kiss between two people, after she finished kissing him, she was panting like a dog, while he remained calm and composed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be that the person who takes the initiative has to work harder?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler slowly opened his eyes and looked at Tina. Her face was slightly red, and her lips were moist and shiny, looking very attractive...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of the kiss just now, his body couldn't help but tense up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So now do you know what kind of feelings you have for me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...just a kiss, I'm afraid it's not enough," she licked her lips and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what else do you want?" he asked calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At least a hug, a normal couple's hug," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised an eyebrow, "Normal couple's hug?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!" She said, taking the initiative to hug his waist and snuggling into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A hint of doubt flashed in Chandler's eyes. He didn't think this hug was any different from their usual ones!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then he found out what the difference was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because her restless hands were slipping into his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina!" he said, grabbing her restless hand, "What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina grimaced in pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I just wanted to wipe some oil, you don't have to pinch me so hard..." she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before she could finish, he picked up the blanket next to the sofa and wrapped her in it, then lifted her up horizontally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, what are you doing?" Tina shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's late, you should sleep!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "..." Her goal for today was to sleep, but that meant sleeping with him! "What about you? Will you sleep with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What do you think? We're alone together now. If we really sleep on the same bed, do you plan on having your parents come after me tomorrow?" Chandler gave her a direct look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "As long as I don't say anything and you don't say anything, how would they find out?" She said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You don't really think they wouldn't find out, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As they spoke, Chandler had already carried Tina back to the room, threw her onto the bed, and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Hey! Chandler!" She called out his full name, "Your fianc&eacute;e is making a move, and you...you're just going to leave like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Or was it that he didn't have any feelings for her and didn't really love her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Didn't they say that when a man faced a woman he liked, he couldn't resist temptation and would even become like a wild beast, full of desire?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But why did she feel like she was the one who was unsatisfied now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What do you want to do?!" Chandler turned his head and looked down at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I just want to know if I really love you!" She said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So you want to have sex with me to find out?" He glared at her.</p></div>
