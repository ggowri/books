        <h1>Chapter 4384  A Farce</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better put your clothes on right now," Calvert said with disgust, "or I'm calling the police!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, go ahead and call the cops," the other person said smugly. "When they arrive and see this scene, they'll probably think you're the one who assaulted me. After all, I'm just an innocent fan who entered my idol's apartment out of trust."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl paused, only then realizing there was someone else in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly turned towards the direction of the sound, spotting Harley sitting on the sofa. In a fluster, she grabbed the blanket next to her, using it to shield her body. "Who are you, and how did you get in?" she demanded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who I am is none of your business," Harley said coldly. "As for how I got in, it certainly wasn't the same way you did. Also, you claim to be an innocent fan who just happened to wander into your idol's apartment. Do you even know what surveillance is? You can't possibly think that a place like this, especially the underground parking lot, wouldn't have security cameras."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's face immediately turned sour.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even if she had considered the issue of surveillance, she thought that </span><span>as long as</span><span> she had sex with Calvert first, then naturally Calvert wouldn't dare let others know. She could even demand more from Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This newly debuted model, who's just starting to gain some fame, would be terrified if any scandal were to arise. If not handled carefully, it could ruin their entire career.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why she had the guts to do it like that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who could have guessed that there's not just Calvert in this room, but another woman as well</span><span>?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, your name is Janice, right?" Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's face changed </span><span>again,</span><span> she hadn't expected her name to be known as well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better put your clothes on now because the police are on their way," Harley said. "And don't think you can play the victim here. Not only do I have my testimony, but everything you've done in this room has been recorded. We'll use this evidence to charge you with breaking, theft, and defamation."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How could you do this to me</span><span>?</span><span> I just adore my </span><span>idol,</span><span> I haven't caused him any real harm. How could you do this!" The girl said indignantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should've known the consequences of your actions," Harley said. "Don't think you can just cry and gain sympathy to get out of this. This kind of serious incident isn't that easy to resolve!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl suddenly charged at Harley, raising her hand to hit him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, a figure moved even faster, stepping in front of Harley. He swiftly grabbed the girl's hand, preventing any chance of her landing a hit on Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" The girl's face twisted in pain, "My hand... it feels like it's going to break..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Calvert remained indifferent, continuing to grip the other person's hand tightly, completely disregarding their face full of pain </span><span>now</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert!" It was Harley who stopped him, "Let her go first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert turned his head, looking at Harley, "But she just tried to hurt you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She didn't hurt me, did she? And I don't think she dares to do it again." Harley glanced at the girl's frightened and pained expression, then added, "Besides, the police will be here soon. If you hurt her, even if we're in the right, it will look like we're not."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert remained silent, seemingly unwilling to let off the girl who intended to harm Harley so easily.</span></p></div>
