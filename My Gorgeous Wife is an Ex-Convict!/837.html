        <h1>Chapter 836</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's fingers clutched Brian's neck as if he was about to break his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick quickly put down the glass in his hand and grabbed Jason's hand, trying to pull it away from Brian&rsquo;s neck. "Jason, what are you doing? Brian was just asking. You&hellip; You mustn't act on impulse..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was scared to death, but Brian, who was being grabbed by the neck, showed no fear on his face. He asked, "Is it... because of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the moment he uttered the words, the fingers around his neck tightened so hard that Brian started choking as his face turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick got nervous. "Jason, let go! Let go! Are you really going to strangle Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh. What the hell is going on? If something happens to these two big shots when they're at my place, my life will probably be over!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick tried his best to pull Jason's hand away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it.. because of Brian?' Jason's eyes stared at the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, rather than Brian, it was because he did not want to be betrayed someday. He did not want to be on tenterhooks because Grace had Brian in her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to repeat his father's mistakes and have someone else control his life. The only person in charge of his destiny was himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's fingers loosened. Brian coughed twice before finally breathing again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was relieved. Nothing bad had happened. His heart would not be able to take it if something like this happened a few more times!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it matter?" Jason spat these words out coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at him and smirked. "Indeed, it doesn't matter. Now that you and Grace have broken up, whoever Grace dates has nothing to do with you, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, those icy peach blossom eyes looked so terrifying, as if he was going to kill the other man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the weekend, Grace went to the hospital to visit Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had gone to the small restaurant to look for her, but when she arrived, she learned from the staff that Kyla was hospitalized, which was why she came to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Kyla who was lying in the hospital bed, Grace was completely shocked when she learned the reason Kyla was injured. She did not expect that so much had happened in just a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if you were seriously injured? What if..." Grace dare not think about the rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I was reckless. However, I couldn&rsquo;t think of any other way." Kyla smiled wryly. "I was afraid that he&rsquo;d really force me to give him a child, then my child would have to call the woman who hurt me 'Mommy'."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no idea how desperate Kyla was to do such a dangerous move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss did more harm to Kyla than she had imagined. Besides, Kyla was probably so resolute because she did not want to have any relationship with Martin Weiss at all.</p></div>
