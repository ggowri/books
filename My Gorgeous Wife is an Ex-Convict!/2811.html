        <h1>Chapter 2809</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, aren't you going to pretend to be a loving couple with me? Can't you take even one kiss? How are you going to convince people that we&rsquo;re in love?" Martin Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll pay attention in public, of course. But I don't want to do anything extra when it's just the two of us," she said. Such intimacy might only stir up her hard-won calmness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anything extra?" Martin Weiss's voice was cold as his eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Am I wrong?" She looked up to meet his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two looked at each other, and silence filled the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pressing her slightly dry lips, Kyla broke the silence, changed the subject, and said, "By the way, I can stay in the same room as Nelson and Trista. Trista can sleep in a crib."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've arranged Nelson's room. You're sharing a room with me. I&rsquo;ll have the crib moved to our bedroom later," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A room?" Kyla froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you think it&rsquo;ll be strange for a loving couple to sleep separately? We have many servants in the mansion, and they're constantly watching us," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla paused. Well, it was indeed as he said. It might provoke speculation if they slept separately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll look for the children first," Kyla said and walked out of the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was left alone in the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss raised his hand to caress his lips. Her warmth seemed to linger there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Them pretending to be a loving couple was only a temporary solution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... am I thinking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I felt pain and anger when I heard her say she has moved on and that the kiss was extra!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I so angry about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I mad that she could move on so easily? She had just gone to L City not long ago, saying she wanted him to fall for her again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or am I mad with myself for not getting over her? Even though I resorted to hypnosis to forget my feelings for her, I still can't get rid of her influence on me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like the kiss earlier. Only he knew what started as a punishment and retaliation for her so-called moving on became him getting addicted to the kiss afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, what do you really want?" he murmured to himself. However, he could not give himself the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Nelson went to bed at night, Kyla came to the room she shared with Martin Weiss. The crib was already in the room, and Trista, who was only six months old, was sleeping soundly in the crib.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stood by the baby's crib, looking down at his sleeping daughter in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their son looked more like him with only his eyes and smile looking like Kyla, while their daughter looked more like Kyla.</p></div>
