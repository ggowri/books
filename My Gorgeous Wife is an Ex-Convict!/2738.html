        <h1>Chapter 2736</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why did you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said it's up to me to decide when to divorce." With that said, he got up. "It's late. I'll have the driver take you back to the old residence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss said, "Martin, as a mother, I only wish you safety. Even if you owe Kyla anything, you paid that debt long ago. Do you know I almost fainted when I found out you donated your liver to Kyla a second time? I was really afraid that you were going to die just like that and I would lose my son!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss began sobbing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Mrs. Weiss left, Martin Weiss went to the study and opened the drawer. There was a divorce agreement in the drawer, and Kyla had signed her part.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, he only had to hand it over to the lawyer after signing it. Then, he and Kyla would be officially divorced a day later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... he kept delaying signing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was what he had wanted, but he had felt empty when Kyla gave the papers to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had ever owed her anything, he had already cleared that debt just as his mother had said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was a knock on the study door. Martin Weiss put the agreement back in the drawer and said indifferently, "Come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door was pushed open, and Shana Nicholls walked in. She spoke gently to Martin Weiss, "Mr. Weiss, it's time to take your medicine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss got up, took the pills Shana Nicholls handed him, and swallowed them with water. Then, he handed the glass back to Shana Nicholls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls's fingers seemed to inadvertently touch Martin Weiss's when she took the glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss glanced at her coldly, and Shana Nicholls suddenly panicked. The glass in her hand fell to the floor, and the water spilled all over the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hold the glass properly." Shana Nicholls apologized quickly and bent down to pick up the broken glass on the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly screamed. Her fingers were pricked by the broken glass, and the tips of her fingers oozed with red blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ouch!" she shouted softly. She looked at Martin Weiss with tears in her eyes, looking pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Normally, men will express worry for me at such a time. That way, I can get into their arms...' Shana Nicholls cooked up a plan in mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss said nothing and just looked at her coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze made Shana Nicholls guilty. "M-Mr. Weiss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why aren't you clearing the mess yet?" Martin Weiss asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls endured the pain in her fingers as she gritted her teeth and continued to clean up the broken glass on the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got up when she was done. "I... I'll leave first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, you can go back to the hospital starting tomorrow. I don't need you here anymore," Martin Weiss said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Shana Nicholls was terrified. Kyla had finally left. She thought she would finally have a chance, but Martin Weiss's words made her drop her expectations instantly. "Mr. Weiss, w-what did I do wrong? Or did I upset you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm well enough now that I don't need a nurse anymore. Of course, you should go back to the hospital," Martin Weiss said calmly.</p></div>
