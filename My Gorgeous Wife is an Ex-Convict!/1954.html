        <h1>Chapter 1952</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'At least after the party, I... can have a cake with him. Perhaps he won't say no to eating a slice of cake together.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina thought about it and ordered a Disney Mickey and Minnie-shaped cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After giving out her information, the cashier handed her the receipt to collect the cake later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina put away the receipt and walked out of the store, but a stranger came over and blocked her way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Miss Lina? Our madam would like to see you." Although he spoke quite respectfully, not the slightest respect was in his eyes when he looked at Lina. They even carried a faint trace of disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Who&rsquo;s your madam?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"President Stephenson's mother," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Hadwin's mother?' Lina froze. Speaking of which, though she dated Hadwin back then, she had never met his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin also said he would take her to see his mother after he secured his position in the Stephenson family, but she did not expect it to be five years later when she had the opportunity to see his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"And how do I know she sent you?" Lina asked warily. After all, she did not want to be kidnapped again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He took out a phone, and the video call soon got through. Lina saw an elegant woman in front of the camera, saying in an indifferent voice, "Miss Sweeney, I'm Hadwin Stephenson's mother. I'd like to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina recognized at a glance that the woman was indeed Hadwin Stephenson's mother. She looked somewhat similar to Hadwin Stephenson, and the most important thing was that she had seen a photo of Hadwin&rsquo;s mother online before. The person in the video looked the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I'll go over," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The video call ended, and Lina followed the man into a car parked on the roadside. They drove to a private club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina met Emily Flowers, it was in a private room of the club. Wearing designer clothes and eye-catching jewelry, Emily Flowers sat on a couch sipping on a cup of tea while a tea expert brewed tea for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Would you like a drink, Miss Sweeney?" asked Emily Flowers as she looked lazily at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, thank you." Lina politely refused. After all, she was in no condition to drink tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Everyone, leave the room," Emily Flowers said to the others in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Several people responded and left the private room, leaving only Lina and Emily Flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Have a seat," said Emily Flowers as she pointed to the couch opposite her. Although her tone sounded polite, the indifference in her eyes was inconcealable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina sat down, only to hear the person in front of her say, "Miss Sweeney, you're pregnant, aren't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze. Her tone was not inquisitive but affirmative. She was only four months pregnant and her clothes were loose, so it was hard to notice that she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes." She admitted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is the baby in your belly Hadwin's?" Emily Flowers continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," she answered again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Abort it," Emily Flowers's mouth spat out these two words lightly.</p></div>
