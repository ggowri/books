        <h1>Chapter 1831</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My dear. We&rsquo;re already old. We're not afraid of gossip. We just want you to live a good life," Mrs. Sweeney said with red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Having a baby out of wedlock meant her daughter would be walking on a difficult path in the future. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's nose felt sore. Her parents had been worried sick about her, and she could not do anything to make it up to them. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at his daughter, Mr. Sweeney said sternly, "If you can keep the baby, are you sure you won't regret giving birth to them? Raising a baby is unlike raising a pet. Life is going to be tough." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina took a deep breath. "I've made up my mind. I won't regret it. As long as the baby lets me be their mommy, I won't give up on them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay. Then give birth to the baby. We can afford to raise a child, can't we?" said Mr. Sweeney. Since his daughter had made such a decision, as her father, he would take good care of her and the unborn child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's tears could not help pouring out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My dear, don't cry! Crying hurts the body, and it&rsquo;ll be harder to prevent a miscarriage. Don't cry. Don't cry!" Mrs. Sweeney quickly wiped away her daughter's tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I won't cry. I won't cry!" Lina struggled to hold back her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All she wanted now was to keep her baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace rushed to the hospital after learning the news of Lina's hospitalization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was dumbfounded when she found out that things between her best friend and Hadwin Stephenson were completely over. After she bid goodbye to Lina the day before yesterday, she thought Lina and Hadwin Stephenson were getting back together, but it turned out to be the opposite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What happened?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We're not meant for each other. Of course, we shouldn&rsquo;t be together." Lina smiled bitterly and said, "But I'll give birth to this baby. Grace, I seem to understand why Kyla chose to give birth to Nelson now. Maybe I'll bring up the child alone, just like Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "How are you alone? You have your parents and me. Don't forget, your child is going to call me &lsquo;Godmother&rsquo;! Remember what you said to me? If you ever have children, your children will be my children too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze. When the long-forgotten words came out of her best friend's mouth again, they brought back memories of that year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her eyes reddened and she said, "Yes, you're my baby's mommy too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, you don't have to worry about anything. I have your back! Lina, I have your back," Grace said in a firm voice. She would protect Lina and prevent her from getting hurt again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace was discharged from the hospital, Jason came to pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing her frustration, he asked, "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina said she and Hadwin Stephenson are completely over. She intends to give birth to the baby and raise them alone," Grace said with a sad look on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows as if a little shocked. "Did Hadwin Stephenson agree to this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "Yeah. Hadwin Stephenson promised Lina that they would not have anything to do with each other anymore. The day before yesterday, Lina seemed determined to get back together with Hadwin Stephenson. How did it turn out like this?"</p></div>
