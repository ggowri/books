        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Even in the past, it was already such a difficult task being able to find a job to provide for me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But you can't waste your years doing this job. How can you find a good husband like this?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace smiled at Claire. She meant well. Truly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The biggest concern for people like Claire was marriage.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Chase doesn't seem to mind your past,&rdquo; Claire went on. &ldquo;Are you sure you don't want to consider it? Honest men like Chase are rare nowadays."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, it's impossible for me and him," Grace replied. She wouldn&rsquo;t give Claire any hope, lest she tries to interfere. That would just end badly&hellip;for all of them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Claire hesitated before asking, "Grace, do you think of Chase as a lower class because he's just a driver? After all, your ex-boyfriend was&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Claire!" Grace interrupted her and said, "I don't think that. It's just... I've been through so much, I'm not wanting to get into a relationship."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, you child!" Claire sighed. "You should know that if you really don't marry and stay by yourself, you might not feel it that much now, but when you're old with no children around you... it's going to be a kind of loneliness that no one can endure."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Children..." Grace smiled wryly. "I'm afraid that's wishful thinking for me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn&rsquo;t just issues of conception, she was not some wealthy or powerful person who could ensure that her children would be protected. Would she subject them to ridicule or bullying? Kids were mean. And she suspected that if schoolmates learned of Grace&rsquo;s past, they might pick on her children. No. She would not allow that.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a day's worth of work, Grace and Claire packed up their tools and returned to the Sanitation Service Center.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace was returning the tools, she did not come across Farah Steele, who had been constantly targeting her. However, just as she was preparing to wash her hands, she saw Farah and Chase standing by the sink.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Grace has been to prison, Chase. Why are you still waiting for her? Does that mean I'm not as good as a person who's been in jail?" Farah asked indignantly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chase replied unhappily, "Can you not talk about her being in prison every time you open your mouth? Grace was driving carelessly, she didn't mean to hurt anyone!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She was driving under the influence! How is that unintentional?!" Farah retorted. &ldquo;She's a f*cking witch. And you&rsquo;re some fool who&rsquo;s fallen under her spell!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I would be willing to be under her spell!" Chase answered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace heard the details of their conversation were still related to her and subconsciously wanted to avoid them. However, just as she wanted to leave, Farah noticed her and immediately shouted, "Grace, you're so shameless that you're eavesdropping!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace sighed and stopped in her tracks. "This is a place in the Sanitation Service Center that everyone can visit. I came here to wash my hands, how is that eavesdropping? If you're afraid that someone else will hear you, then you should look for a room and talk behind closed doors," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You..." Farah glared at Grace angrily, then made a nasty remark before leaving: "You wait and see!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace smiled faintly. "I heard that so many times when I was in jail."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chase glanced at Grace uneasily and said, "Don't take what she said just now to heart."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I won't take it to heart," Grace said. Maybe it was a blessing that she should come upon Chase like this. &ldquo;This is my life, Chase. The ridicule, the gossip. It isn&rsquo;t fun and it isn&rsquo;t pretty.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I would defend you,&rdquo; he vowed. And his eyes were so earnest, she wished she was a different person and that she could be the kind of woman that Chase needed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I know you would. You&rsquo;re a good man.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Seriously, Grace. Give me a chance.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She shook her head. &ldquo;I don't want you to waste time on me. It's like what she said. I've been to jail and am not suitable for you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't mind that," he hurriedly replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When his eyes met her confused gaze, he explained, "I... I know you're a good woman, so I really don't mind if you've been to jail."</p></div>
