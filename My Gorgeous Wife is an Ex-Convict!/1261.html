        <h1>Chapter 1260</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they said that, there was a sudden silence in the general office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A rich man named Yi... The richest man in Emerald City had the last name Yi! They all looked at each other. It seemed they had seen the speculation in each other's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, someone finally said, "It can't be... Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz retorted, "No way! Those people... must be extras Grace sent to make us believe that she's indeed married. Besides, if she's married to Jason, why would she have to look for a job to raise her baby? And how did she get pregnant when she has only worked here for less than three months?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A colleague could not help but say, "It's unlikely that... she's acting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. Isn't it better to just get a man to pretend to be her husband?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone there was no fool. They could naturally distinguish how far-fetched Andrea Schwartz's rebuttal was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone went over to the window and looked down. Moments later, someone exclaimed, "Oh my God, the car that&rsquo;s here to pick Grace up is a limited edition Lincoln limousine. That car costs a lot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And the car plate number is all nines. Oh my God! That car plate is amazing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In Emerald City, Jason is probably the only one who owns a car with such a car plate number and the last name Yi."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace really married Jason? Oh my God, that's shocking!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh my God, Grace can do whatever she wants in Emerald City from now on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone was discussing it all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz could only feel slaps on her face. She had just said Grace got pregnant before marriage and was working in the firm to raise her baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace left in a Lincoln limousine right afterward, and it was likely she had married Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did the wife of the richest man in Emerald City need to work such a low-paying job in their firm to &lsquo;raise her baby&rsquo;? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz only wished she could hide in a hole!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed them to the hospital where Old Master Reed was still half-lying on the bed like before. He had a drip on the back of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only found Old Master Reed to be thinner than he had been the last time she saw him, and life seemed to be fading from him. He appeared lifeless now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the old man before her was only relying on the last bit of his life. He would probably... leave this world... soon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you married Jason, but you don't deserve him, let alone the Reed family." Old Master Reed made no secret of his hatred for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you don't think I deserve him, I've married him," Grace said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll give you a substantial amount of money if you divorce him. As for the three babies in your belly, abort them. I don't need you to give birth to any child for the Reed family, and you don't deserve to give birth to children of the Reed family's bloodline," the old man said coldly, his clouded eyes showing no emotion.</p></div>
