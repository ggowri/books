        <h1>Chapter 1454</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He must have longed for Old Master Reed to shower him with the affection a grandparent would have for their grandchild. When he returned to the Reed family, Old Master Reed was the only one he could rely on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace muttered, "But I should also thank him for raising you so that I could meet you, Jay. I'll give you the familial affection you want. The kids will give it to you too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was a little stunned. A look of surprise glimmered in his eyes. He had never told her this, but she knew... he longed for familial affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You said everyone cares about different things, then what about you? What do you care about most?" he muttered as he took in her scent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He liked to smell her scent. It made him feel reassured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Me?" Grace thought about it for a while and said, "What I care about most is the family I have with you. I care about you and the kids. That's what I care most about!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But Grace, I'm greedy. I'm so greedy I'm unwilling to share your concern with anyone else. Even if they're our children, I still hope I'm the one you care about most," muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace blinked. 'Umm... Is he even jealous of the kids?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I care about all three children the same way, but I care about you in a different way&mdash;in a unique way," said Grace as her hands gently hugged the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a slightly difficult and awkward movement because her belly was quite large now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her embrace made him feel warm amidst the cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Unique?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, unique. No one can replace it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't know how to care about you &lsquo;the most&rsquo;. Maybe you and the kids are equally important to me after becoming a mother, but if you want me to care more about you, then I'll care about you a lot more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, I'll give you whatever you want as long as I can provide it. I just want you to be happy and smile more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her voice was so clear in his ears, and it gently warmed his heart despite the cold air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was Grace, his wife, and his &lsquo;sis&rsquo;. She gave him everything he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She made him understand the feeling of loving someone and what happiness was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One would have muddled through life if one never got it. However, upon getting it, one would not want to lose it no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I&rsquo;ll be happy! Grace, you only need to know that I'll smile when I have you by my side," Jason hugged Grace back and murmured affectionately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She made him happy, and he only smiled for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace attended Old Master's funeral as his granddaughter-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although the marriage between Jason and Grace had not been reported by Emerald City's media, some people in Emerald City's high society knew that Grace had joined the Reed family.</p></div>
