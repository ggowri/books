        <h1>Chapter 614</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once someone was after his prey, they would be hit the hardest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What kind of comfort is that?" Lina rolled her eyes. "What if Grace and Jason's relationship fails, or if she accidentally annoys Jason? What do you think Jason will do to Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, there was always a rainy day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin laughed, flexed his fingers, and flicked Lina's forehead. "You think so little of your friend. I'm afraid the inferior one is Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned and opened her mouth in surprise. 'No way! The word &lsquo;inferior&rsquo; can&rsquo;t be synonymous with Jason.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you kidding me?" muttered Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do I look like I'm joking?" asked Hadwin. "I'm afraid the one who's in the driver&rsquo;s seat in their relationship is still your friend, so there are some things you don't have to think about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In relationships, the one who loved more was always the one who was dominated. Between Jason and Grace, Jason was obviously the one who loved more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like he and she... Hadwin looked at the woman in front of him. She thought he was taking revenge on her through this relationship, but only he knew the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only begging her to love him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In their relationship, he was dominated by her. No matter how unwilling he was, he was willing... To be at her mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To let her control his emotions and anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just because... He loved her and unconsciously loved her too deeply...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On Saturday, when Grace got off work, Jason came to pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm taking you somewhere," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where?" she asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll find out soon enough," he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she followed him to the place he had spoken of, she found that it was her old house&mdash;the one her father and stepmother were selling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He opened the door with a key and brought her in, which meant... "You bought this house?" she asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he said. &ldquo;After all, there are memories of you and your mother here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly and said, "You don't have to buy this apartment for me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, his fingers were pressed against her lips. He interrupted her. "The money I paid for this apartment is nothing to me, but it could retain some of your memories. If you don't like it, you can just leave it be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her lips distinctly felt the warmth of his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gently pulled down his hand and said, "Thank you." She knew he had done all this for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There ought to be something of your mother&rsquo;s here. Why don't you take a look?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. 'Mom's stuff?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She followed him to one of the rooms which had been her old room. It was turned into a storage room when she went to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she walked into the room, she was surprised to find that they did not empty the room. They only got rid of the clutter.</p></div>
