        <h1>Chapter 3032</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, George's heart was filled with even more pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at the other person and simply said, "Hello."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she doesn't have a good impression of George, and it can be said that all the suffering Amber has endured is due to her relationship with George.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If George had trusted Amber from the beginning, she wouldn't have suffered for so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George said, "Hello, I want to thank you for helping me protect Simon today. If you ever need any help from the Gregory family in the future, don't hesitate to ask. I will definitely help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This is also his promise to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying this, George turned to his son and said, "Simon, let's go. It's time to go back. Your grandparents are very worried about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, Simon seemed somewhat unwilling as he walked from Valda's side to his own father's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he was leaving, Simon quietly turned back and looked at Valda several times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda couldn't help but feel a twinge of heartache in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, this child is just a child who longs for love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they returned to their hotel room, Valda said, "I feel like Simon actually wants to see his mother. On one hand, he really hopes that his mother loves him, but on the other hand, he doesn't believe that she does."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you feel sorry for that child?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mmm," she said, "it's quite heartbreaking. I couldn't bring myself to say anything like 'his mother will come back' while I was in front of the child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because if it were Amber in her place, after suffering so much harm, she wouldn't choose to come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fortunately, you were able to notice Simon today. Otherwise, he might have really been abducted by that woman. It would have been difficult to find the child then," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At that time, I noticed him because I thought he looked a lot like me when I was a child," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Like the way you were when you were a child?" Brian was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems very lonely," Valda said. "When my parents passed away, even though I was taken in by my uncle's family, that feeling of loneliness never left me. At that time, I often didn't want to go home after school and would frequently stay outside by myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian hugged Valda with a heart full of pity and said, "I won't let you feel so lonely again in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda hugged Brian tightly, burying her face deeply in his embrace. "Brian, I won't let you be alone anymore in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps, both of them were once lonely individuals, but after meeting each other, they finally no longer have to be alone!</p></div>
