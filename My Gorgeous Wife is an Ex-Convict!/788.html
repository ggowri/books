        <h1>Chapter 787</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'From now on, I don't have to worry so much about whether she would go to Brian, and I don't have to guess how much of her heart is with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I won't repeat my father's mistakes. I won't let myself become as awkward and embarrassed as a lost dog just to love someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I surely won't!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Jason finally left the kitchen and walked up the stairs to the second floor alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence looked at the back of his boss with mixed feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If there really is someone in the world who could control Young Master Reed's life and death&hellip;' Somehow, Grace's name came to his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace woke up the next day to see a beautifully wrapped gift box at her bedside. It was a birthday gift from Lina and Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that she did not open it last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slowly sitting up, Grace opened the box, and inside was a tiny, exquisite doll that looked a bit like her. It was dressed in a lawyer's suit, looking so cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the box was a handwritten card from Lina. &lsquo;Grace, I wish that you&rsquo;ll be happy every day and that you&rsquo;ll move closer toward your dreams!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;PS: Press the doll's left palm for a surprise!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Happy? Dreams?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will I still have these things?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's hand reached to the doll's left palm, which had a small protruded button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed it gently, and a voice rang from the doll's body. &ldquo;I want to be a good lawyer for the sake of justice in my heart. Haha. I hope that those who come to me for help in the future will find it a good thing to have me as their lawyer after their lawsuit is over!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... my voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's what I had said!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the doll in her hand in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She vaguely remembered Lina celebrating her first day at the law firm, and she had taken a video of her on her phone when they started talking excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the time, this was what she said in the video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, I didn't expect... Lina to keep the video and cut out my voice from the video and put it in the doll.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt the doll getting heavy in her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's probably my greatest luck to have met Lina!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina came to the inn to look for Grace, the latter had washed up and changed into clean clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a normal working day today. You don't have to come and accompany me. I'm fine," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about? Besides, I've asked for leave today. Even if I go back to work, they'll still deduct my wages for today's leave," said Lina. Then, she saw the unwrapped gift box and the doll on the bedside table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, seemingly regretfully, "You've seen the gift? Hey, I thought I could unwrap it with you!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chuckled. "I love the gift. Thank you, Lina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's great that you like it!" said Lina. She saw that her best friend seemed alright. At least she did not have two panda eyes. "What are you going to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll look for a place to stay first. After all, I can't stay in this inn forever. I think I'll go to the real estate agent today and look for a suitable house to rent. When I've settled down, I'll go to a law firm and see if I can find a suitable job." Grace told her about her plans.</p></div>
