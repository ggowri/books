        <h1>Chapter 2390</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Martin Weiss took Kyla to Gregory Corporation's office building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla saw George Gregory, bitterness filled her heart. She recalled Amber Mitchell smiling and saying, &ldquo;If we have the chance to meet again, I&rsquo;ll introduce you to the person I love. He kept saying that he fell in love with me at first sight. He courted me for a long time. He said I was too difficult to court. What he doesn't know is that I fell for him the moment I set my eyes on him!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why did you let him court you for so long?" she had asked in confusion at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell replied, "Maybe I was afraid of getting hurt. I told you my parents don&rsquo;t have a happy marriage. My father married my mother just for the influence of my mother's family. I don't want to repeat that mistake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must trust him since you've started dating him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, he's not like my father. I believe he really loves me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could still hear Amber Mitchell's voice, but the man she trusted married another woman right after she was admitted to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Kyla met the man Amber Mitchell loved under such circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory, this is my wife, Kyla," Martin Weiss said as he introduced them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Mrs. Weiss." George Gregory reached out his hand to Kyla to give her a polite handshake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla only stared blankly at him without extending her hand. George Gregory frowned slightly and said with a half-smile, "What's the matter, Mrs. Weiss? Is it because I look strange?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla," Martin Weiss called out to remind Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla then came to her senses, reached out her hand, and shook George Gregory's hand before saying, "Sorry, I was a little distracted just now. Mr. Gregory, you're not strange; you&rsquo;re good-looking. I'm sure you've swept many women off their feet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're too kind, Mrs. Weiss." George Gregory smiled and asked them to sit down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss and George Gregory talked about business. Kyla was not interested in their conversation. Her eyes were focused on George Gregory as if she wanted to get information from his expressions, manners, and words. She wanted to know what kind of man Amber Mitchell loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was so focused that George Gregory found it strange. The senior executives beside George Gregory looked at Martin Weiss, Kyla, and George Gregory in confusion too. They each had their own speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they finished talking about business and George Gregory was about to ask them to join him for dinner, Martin Weiss beat him to it by saying, "Mr. Gregory, I have something I'd like to discuss with you alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, George Gregory asked the senior executives who attended the meeting to leave. "I wonder what you need, Chairman Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"To be precise, my wife has something that she would like to ask you. She has a friend she has been looking for for many years. She recently found out that her friend was once your fianc&eacute;e, Mr. Gregory," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory's expression instantly changed once Martin Weiss finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of fianc&eacute;e... there could only be one person&mdash;Amber Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even his wife, Louise Mitchell, had never been his fianc&eacute;e as they decided to get married right away. They skipped getting engaged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory instantly understood why Mrs. Weiss had been looking at him so intently.</p></div>
