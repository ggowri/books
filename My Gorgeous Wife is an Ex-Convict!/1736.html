        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"By the way, why did you suddenly come to the clinic today?" she asked. After all, she never told him she was seeing Dr. Russell today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "I heard from the driver that you were at the clinic, so I thought of coming over to have a look. I wanted to go in and accompany you, but you came out sooner than I expected. I'll accompany you when you go for treatment next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, it's just treatment, and it's probably going to be frequent. It'll disturb your work," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyelashes quivered slightly. Out of the corners of his eyes, he glanced at Grace and replied, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the car arrived at Reed Residence's entrance, Grace got down and walked inside. Jason did not immediately turn and drive away but remained in the same spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason raised his hand and pulled on his hair irritably. He recalled the confrontation with Brian at the clinic&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jason, why on earth did Grace fall into the sea? Even if you&rsquo;ve lost your memory, someone must have told you the truth! No one would tell me what happened when I asked. Can't you tell me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Brian, why should I tell you what happened between Grace and me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"After Grace found out that her car accident had something to do with you, she fell into the sea. Are these two things related?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Are they related... I'd like to know that myself! Terrence and the butler told me the same thing&mdash;Secretary Wang instructed Lily to kidnap Grace to the seaside. Then, Grace accidentally fell into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But is that really what happened?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If not, what could the truth be?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason took out his phone. After hesitating for a moment, he made a call. "It's me. Let's proceed with hypnosis treatment and recover my memory as planned."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina had dry-cleaned the clothes she wore when she left Hadwin Stephenson's mansion that day and went to Stephenson Group's office building in Emerald City, intending to return them to Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She went to the reception desk and explained her intention. She thought she would have to go through a lot of trouble to meet Hadwin Stephenson, but as soon as the receptionist heard that she was here to return the clothes, they spoke respectfully and warmly without asking for her name. "You must be Miss Lina. President Stephenson said you can go see him right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The receptionist led Lina to the elevator and helped her press the floor number as they spoke, "The president's office is on the 32nd floor. You'll be led to President Stephenson's office when you arrive on the floor!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina did not expect Hadwin Stephenson to have told his employees about her arrival. When she reached the 32nd floor, there was already someone waiting at the doors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hello, Miss Sweeney. I'm President Stephenson's secretary. Please come with me," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina followed the secretary to Hadwin Stephenson's office door. After gently knocking on the door twice, the secretary twisted the doorknob and said to Lina, "Miss Sweeney, please enter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I can go in?" asked Lina. After all, although the secretary had knocked on the door twice, there was no response from Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The president said you can enter at any time," the secretary said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina pressed her red lips together and went in.</p></div>
