        <h1>Chapter 673</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt like she was being urged to get married. "Actually... We're pretty much married now," she said. Come to think of it, they were living together now. They were even sleeping in the same bed. They were only one marriage certificate short of being married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not the same. In the eyes of others, you're still Miss Cummins, not Mrs. Reed. I want you to be completely mine, and I&rsquo;ll also be completely yours," muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt that Jason cared too much about the certificate. "Even if you get married, you can still get a divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just blurted it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's expression immediately changed. His deep eyes darkened immensely. "Do you think even if we get married, we'll get a divorce someday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was soft, but in the quiet room, it was very clear to her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His arms, which he had been holding around her, tightened unconsciously. Grace felt his arms shaking faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not saying we're going to get a divorce. I just don't think that just because we're married, we belong to each other completely. After all, it's the people who make the decisions, not the papers," Grace bit her red lip slightly and said to Jason, "If we love each other, then we belong to each other. If we don't love each other anymore one day, then we no longer belong to each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you ever stop loving me?" His stare was burning into her, but his voice was cautious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but laugh. "Jason, I can't think of any reason not to love you." He had been so good to her and had done so much for her. He was even willing to fall in love with her when she was at her worst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why would I not love him?' Her love for him had run deep before she knew it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her words made his heart sink a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's the reason not to love? There&rsquo;s just such a reason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Love me. Love me until you can't bear to leave me, all right?" He looked at her almost imploringly, his eyes thick with indissoluble attachment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so absorbed in his eyes that it seemed to her as if they had cast a net over her body. She could not or would not struggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." The word escaped her mouth lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Jason carried Grace in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took her in his arms, walked over to the big bed beside them, and gently lay her down on the bed. He raised his hand and gently unbuttoned her shirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace..." he muttered lovingly. He bent down and kissed her lips, then her jaw, her neck, and her collarbone... "Don't leave me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers squeezed hers. Their two bodies were caught up in each other&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I won't leave you..." she answered him and was caught up in his incessant demands...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The result of their one night of passion was that she could barely get out of bed the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as if her body was falling apart. Last night, she was almost overwhelmed by his intense needs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help blushing a little as she thought about last night. Luckily, it was already noon and Jason had already left for the office.</p></div>
