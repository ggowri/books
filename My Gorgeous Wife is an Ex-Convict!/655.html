        <h1>Chapter 654</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was now wearing those clothes! This made Stella Lindsay feel a little uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was just going to look for a change of clothes for you, but you've already changed," Stella Lindsay said wearily, then she took Brian's arm lovingly before continuing, "Let me introduce you, Brian. This is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right, we know each other," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay thought Brian only knew Jason, but he knew Grace too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a wave of panic struck Stella Lindsay. Then, she comforted herself. 'It's all right, Grace doesn't even remember what happened that year!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Brian found her, it meant that Grace did not tell Brian anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she could play the role of the person who saved Brian as a child, then it was hard to say what she might get.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes fell on Stella Lindsay's arm that was on Brian's arm. She could not help frowning a little. The intimacy was a bit too much as her cousin had a husband!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... She had not seen her cousin-in-law ever since she got back to the Lu family's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed to notice it and pulled back his arm. Stella Lindsay looked a little embarrassed, but then smiled and said, "Grace, you probably don't know that Zhang Quan and I have divorced."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zhang Quan was Stella Lindsay's former husband and a blacksmith.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Divorced? That's so sudden.' However, she sort of knew why when she saw Brian standing next to Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her cousin had long been dissatisfied with marrying only a blacksmith. Brian's sudden appearance must have given her some ideas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Brian was an excellent candidate for a husband in the eyes of the socialites in Emerald City, let alone her cousin who was from a small town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was especially persistent in looking for her cousin. All those girlfriends he had were only substitutes for her cousin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, her cousin's idea seemed to make sense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian's attitude toward her cousin seemed just alright. Grace even found it a little estranged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although her cousin seemed to have high hopes for Brian, whether they could be realized depended on Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you meet Grace, Brian? Did you know her through Mr. Reed?" Stella Lindsay asked insinuatingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just by coincidence," said Grace. Then, she turned to Jason and said, "I'm a little hungry, Jay. Would you mind going out with me to find something to eat nearby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Jason said softly, taking Grace's hand. Then, he said to Brian and Stella Lindsay, "If you'll excuse us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared blankly at their backs. Did he not know long ago that they were in a relationship and was even about to get married?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why did the sight of them walking side by side make his heart ache?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when he saw her in a wedding dress today, he felt suffocated. She was so beautiful in a wedding dress, but it was for another man.</p></div>
