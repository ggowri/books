        <h1>Chapter 2822</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, their touching bodies made Valda Theller feel like her heart was about to burst out of her throat, and her skin felt like it was burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'll go to my bedroom and rest!" Valda Theller hurriedly said. She quickly pushed Brian away and ran into the nearby bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned slightly. Looking at the bedroom with the closed door, his phoenix eyes seemed to fill with contemplation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had her back against the door and was panting. It was as if Brian's touch would make her want to pounce at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is that? Is it because I saw his body?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or... Is it because I love him more now? I love him, so I want to touch him and I crave more of him.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller slowly moved her hand to her heart and tried to breathe deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The violent beating of her heart seemed to tell her how much she loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stayed in her room because she did not know how to face Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, there was a knock on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She jumped up from the couch like a frightened bird. Her eyes were fixed on the door as she wondered whether she should open it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I had the hotel send us dinner. Come out and have dinner with me." Brian's voice rang from outside the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated and said, "You... You go ahead. I'll... I'll eat later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you feeling not well?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A... A little bit," she stammered in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm coming in," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What?' Valda Theller was dumbfounded. However, before she could think of a way to tell him not to come in, the door opened and Brian walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller watched blankly as the tall figure in the white bathrobe walked up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hair was dry now. However, instead of his usual combed-back hairstyle, his bangs covered his forehead, making him look much younger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bathrobe sagged on him, giving him a touch of languor and nonchalance. His chest and graceful collarbone... easily sparked people's imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller wanted to step back but forgot that the couch was behind her. Valda Theller fell on the couch awkwardly after stepping back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your face is red. Have you caught a cold?" Brian said, reaching up to Valda Theller's forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cool palm instantly touched her burning forehead. Valda Theller stiffened while Brian frowned. "It feels a little hot. I'll have the hotel room service bring a thermometer to take your temperature."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No thanks, I don't have a fever!" She looked away quickly to stop his hand from touching her forehead. "I... I just feel a little hot. Didn't you say dinner is here? I... I'll go out for dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, hurrying past him and out of the bedroom into the dining room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Valda Theller's back as she seemed to be escaping in a hurry. His eyes darkened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had ordered a scrumptious dinner. There were six dishes and one soup for the two of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, this hotel was one of the best hotels near the canyon. The chefs were good, and there were many good reviews online. However, even the most delicious meal tasted like wax to Valda Theller at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so absorbed in eating that she dared not glance at Brian. She was afraid he would find out what was on her mind.</p></div>
