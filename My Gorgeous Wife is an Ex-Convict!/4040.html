        <h1>Chapter 4038</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the child was still in an incubator at the hospital and Nancy's body needed to recover, the Reed family decided to schedule the wedding for six months later. Nancy had no objections to this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her only request was that the Reed family bring Miss Fowler to Emerald City for her wedding and that Miss Fowler sit at the head table. To Nancy, Miss Fowler was the adoptive parent of her and her daughter, and someone she planned to honor for the rest of her life. The Reed family readily agreed to her request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had already made arrangements with Miss Fowler's village, as she did not want to accept their gifts or move to Emerald City for retirement. The village chief was asked to take care of Miss Fowler, and a doctor was assigned to give her regular check-ups. The Reed family's care for Miss Fowler put Nancy's mind at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the fifth day of her stay with the Reed family, Mick took Nancy to their ancestral hall. Looking at the tablets of the Reed family's ancestors, Nancy couldn't help but feel a sense of awe. In front of these tablets, she suddenly felt the passage of time and realized how small a person's life was in the river of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was rare for a family to have such an ancestral hall to honor their ancestors. On one wall of the hall hung a photo of a young man. He was very handsome, and Nancy thought that Mason, one of the triplets, resembled him somewhat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What is this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My grandfather," Mick said, "After he died, my great-grandfather put his photo here, maybe to warn future generations."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Warn?" She was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because my grandfather cut off ties with the Reed family for my grandmother, but after leaving the Reed family, their life was not easy. The once high and mighty young master suddenly became an ordinary person with no means of making a living. So my grandmother left my grandfather, and he became even more down and out. In the end, he froze to death on the roadside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was shocked, staring blankly at the man in the photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This deceased man... should have had a life that everyone envied, but in the end, he met such a fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My great-grandfather probably wanted to tell the descendants of the Reed family not to be foolish like my grandfather, to give up their family and everything they have for love," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Based on your grandfather's experience, your great-grandfather's thoughts are not wrong," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My father originally thought he wouldn't fall in love like my grandfather, but then he met my mother," Mick said. "In fact, if you meet the right person, what's wrong with giving up everything? Because if you lose that person, you will feel like you have lost the whole world! Even the meaning of living is lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, his mother chose to jump off a cliff and fall into the sea to prevent his father from making a choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't expect that one day, he would experience the pain that his father had endured at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And only after experiencing it, did he realize that as long as that person is okay, everything else can be sacrificed!</p></div>
