        <h1>Chapter 1463</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was silent. His eyes met her almond-shaped eyes, and the word &lsquo;yes&rsquo; finally came out of his thin lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is it true that you've always known the truth but chose not to say anything because of... the deal with the Atkinson family?" she continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His lips trembled even more. Each of her questions seemed to cut him with a sharp knife, making him feel like he was being executed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the saddest part was that he deserved this execution. He could not even defend himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes or no, answer me!" She raised her voice, and her expression became agitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He said, "Yes... But Grace, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jason, how could you do that? You let someone innocent go to jail for money? You even... You knew what the Atkinson family did to me when I was in prison!" However, he chose not to look into it and just let the matter be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She previously thought he did that because he had mistaken her as the perpetrator in the car accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, now she knew that she had made a fool of herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It turned out... he had known about the truth the whole time. He knew that she was innocent and wronged, but... he did nothing. He did not even have a shred of pity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm sorry... Grace, I'm sorry..." Jason kept apologizing. He wanted to go up and hug her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she suddenly pushed his hand away. "Sorry... It turns out that someone's fate is just this to you. Do you know I almost died in prison? How could you lie to me and fool me like that... How could you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace frowned suddenly, covering her bulging belly with her hands. She was flustered by the wave of pain in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Nothing... Nothing bad must happen to the babies!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew that her agitation had probably caused the abnormality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, what&rsquo;s happening?" Jason quickly grabbed Grace and asked her nervously. Brian also looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"My belly... hurts..." Grace mumbled with difficulty, a thin layer of sweat already breaking out on her forehead. "The babies... The babies..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll get you to the hospital right away!" Jason immediately picked Grace up and rushed out of the main house. Brian followed them too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace only felt the pain getting worse and worse. She began to blackout. All she could think about before fainting was... &lsquo;Nothing bad must happen to the babies no matter what!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was sent into the emergency room where the doctor carried out a quick examination. Outside the emergency room, Brian looked at Jason who was extremely nervous and did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had never seen Jason like this before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only things related to Grace could make Jason so nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian laughed at the thought. 'And I&rsquo;m the same. I'm nervous because of Grace and almost got into an accident when I followed Jason's car here.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He just hoped that the babies in Grace's belly would be okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It would be too much for Grace to bear if anything happened to the babies, and he did not want to see her sad!</p></div>
