        <h1>Chapter 3676</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at Mason in a daze. He was someone she used to see every day and was the most familiar person to her, but now he seemed so unfamiliar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, Veronica took the initiative to greet Mason, "Hello, it's been a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at Veronica coldly, then turned his head and walked away, completely ignoring her as if she didn't exist in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face showed a hint of embarrassment. Jasper saw this and quickly comforted her, "I think Mason has been abroad for too long, so..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Veronica forced a smile and said, "It's okay. Um...I have something to do later, so I won't eat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica handed the gift she brought to Jasmine, "Jasmine, happy birthday!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Jasmine took the gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suggested, "Why don't you have a piece of cake before you go? Later, I'll have the driver take you home. I also have a lot to talk to you about, Veronica."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I...I really have to go. Let's chat next time we have the chance." Veronica said goodbye to everyone and left the Reed family in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper watched Veronica leave and then turned to look for his own Mason, but found that Mason was no longer in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where did Mason go? It's almost time to cut the cake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go find Mason," Jasper said to William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I'll go myself. You stay here and greet the other guests." Jasper left the living room in a hurry and dialed Mason's phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the phone showed that it was turned off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the road leading to the main entrance of the Reed family's mansion, Mason stood in front of Veronica. "Why did you appear here?" His voice was icy and devoid of any emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was a bit at a loss and said, "I just...came to give Jasmine a gift. Today is her birthday, and I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't know I would be here too?" Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica bit her lip, but couldn't bring herself to say no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, she knew that she had contacted Jasper online before and knew that Mason had returned as an exchange student at Stanford University. So, of course, he would appear at Jasmine's birthday party this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In previous years, she would deliberately avoid him, and if he had to come to the Reed family, she would choose a time when he wasn't there. But this time, she didn't avoid him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you appear in front of me?" Mason said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't mean to appear in front of you, I just wanted to give... Jasmine a gift," Veronica said, even more uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really just wanted to give a gift, you could have had the servant deliver it. It's not hard to find a reasonable excuse," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica hesitated for a moment, finally met his gaze, took a deep breath and said, "It's not hard, I... I knew you were here, so I just wanted to see you when I gave the gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See me?" Mason's expression was indifferent. "Why, do you regret it? Or are you unwilling? Jasper did say that you're not doing as well now. If you really don't want to suffer so much, you can tell my parents. I think they won't treat you badly because of your previous care for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... that's not what I meant," Veronica quickly said. "I just simply wanted to see you because... it's been too long since we last met."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, it had been too long, so she missed him even more, and just wanted to see him for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was once the most important person to her!</span></p></div>
