        <h1>Chapter 152</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A shiver suddenly ran down Evelyn's spine. "He's... is he..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jason, do you know her?" When Patrick heard Jason's comment, he found it strange. Evelyn was a third-rate actress and it was unlikely for her to be acquainted with Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes. We've met once before," Jason replied flatly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn widened her eyes, her heart almost jumping out of her chest. "He's... the man who was living together with Grace!" Back then, she had reckoned that he had met Grace in prison!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn had not expected him to be Jason, the man who called the shots in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She almost fainted. "What's happening? Why was Jason living with Grace in the run-down rental apartment?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian was surprised as he looked at Jason and Evelyn. He then asked, "Evelyn, I never heard you mention that you knew Jason."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn shivered. She smiled wryly and said, "I didn't know it back then... I mean, I didn't know that he was Mr. Reed." After saying that, she apologized to Jason, saying, "Mr. Reed, I'm sorry for having offended you previously. That was all a misunderstanding."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Jason ignored Evelyn. He looked at Brian and said, "In the future, don't bring this woman to me. I don't want to see her."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Evelyn heard that, her face turned pale and she dared not say a word.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A light flashed through Brian's eyes and he looked bewildered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Brian left with Evelyn, Patrick walked over to Jason eagerly and asked, "Has Brian's new girlfriend offended you?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason merely lifted the half-full glass of wine in his hand and knocked it back.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After seeing Evelyn, Jason thought of Grace. If she had stayed by his side, she could have enjoyed a better life and would not have had to continue doing the dirty and tiring job of being a sanitation worker. She would no longer have had to be at the mercy of others, but... she had turned him down.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had seemed... disgusted when he touched her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had been telling himself that she was just like any other woman and he did not have to care about her. However, he was becoming more and more frustrated at that thought.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for Evelyn, she looked at Brian, feeling ill at ease as she asked, "Brian... have I offended Mr. Reed? He..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In the future, steer clear of him," Brian said. He sized Evelyn up and asked, "How did you meet Jason?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I met him at my sister's rental apartment, but Mr. Reed wasn't dressed like this. As my family and my sister were having a dispute back then, we had a conflict with Mr. Reed." Evelyn tried to make it sound as though it was nothing serious as she was afraid that Brian would dump her upon discovering that she had offended Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian was surprised to hear that. "A rental apartment? A sister? Could that be the same woman Patrick told me Jason left Reed Group behind to save on Thanksgiving?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I didn't know that he was Jason. If this will affect you, I can apologize to him. Brian, don't be angry with me. I will be good and behave myself," Evelyn said. Her eyes turned misty and she looked pitiful.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian lifted his hand and touched her lips gently. This was a gesture that he was fond of doing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He favored her lips and had told her that they were attractive. However, it was strange that he had never kissed her.</p></div>
