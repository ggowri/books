        <h1>Chapter 2169</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's eyes widened instantly, and panic flashed across his face. At his age, he was not good at hiding his emotions even though he was sensitive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What about you? What do you think? Do you want to go back? Or are you going to stay with the Reed family?" Jason asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was a little scared. Even though Uncle Reed was smiling at him, he still felt breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I..." The words &lsquo;I want to stay with the Reed family&rsquo; seemed to be stuck in his throat all of a sudden, and he could not say them out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I won't stop you if you want to leave, but you'd better not do anything bad if you want to stay with the Reed family. If you have any bad ideas, I won't let you off the hook, even if you're just a child. I don't care who your father is,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William flinched a little. "I... I won't have any bad ideas. I... I didn't mean to push Nelson Corbyn down the stairs either," he said after summoning the courage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said with a half-smile, "I don't care what the truth is. It doesn't matter to me whether you pushed him or not." He did not care whether Nelson Corbyn lived or died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All he cared about was Grace and their children. Nothing else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just don't like people harming my family, do you understand?" Jason warned him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's tiny face turned ghastly pale as he stammered, unable to speak a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, go out if you understand," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William hung his head low as he walked out of the study. However, he saw Jasper sitting inside when he returned to his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's eyes lit up as he said with excitement, "Lil... Jasper, you... you came. Are you staying here tonight? Why... Why don't I read you a story? I&rsquo;ve memorized several stories. I can tell you the stories!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper Reed's distinct almond-shaped eyes stared at William as she bit her lip with her pearly whites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William suddenly felt uneasy, and his excitement died down. "What... is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let me ask you something. Your daddy came to see you today. Is he taking you home?" she asked. The question had been in her head for a long time. Finally, she could not help coming here to seek the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's expression changed. He seemed to have paled. "You... You know about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you really going back?" Her eyes widened as she instantly felt betrayed. It turned out he was already preparing to leave. She had even talked about how they would be good friends for life and how he would stay in the Reed family forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'He must have been laughing at me when I said that!' Jasper Reed's eyes turned red instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My... My daddy wants me to go back, but I&mdash;" He wanted to say that he wanted to stay with the Reed family, but her words cut him off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then go back! Why are you staying here? Go! You lied and pushed Nelson down the stairs. I don't want someone like you to be my friend anyway. I don't care. William, I hate you!" Jasper snapped as she rushed out of William's room and ran away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William stared blankly at the open door of his room, his little body becoming extremely stiff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A string in his heart seemed to have broken all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was only staying here because he could not bear to part with her, but she did not care about him at all. She did not want to be his friend at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the second time she had said she hated him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was no point in him staying here any longer!</p></div>
