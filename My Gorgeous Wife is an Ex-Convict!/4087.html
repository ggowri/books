        <h1>Chapter 4085</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But don't tell Chandler I said these things! Anyway, if you want to go to the family's place, he has to take you there. You won't be able to get in on your own," Weldon patted Tina's shoulder and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After Weldon left, Tina was still thinking about his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had never been to the family's place, so she didn't even know how to get there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although her mother had said that her father had sent someone to sneak into the family's place before, it almost ended in disaster, and her father had never sent anyone there again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she really goes to her father to ask for Hunter's specific address, her father probably won't give it to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And there's Chandler, who said he'll take her to his family's home after they get married!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she were to ask now, Chandler wouldn't agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, how can she go to his family's home?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina fell into deep thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, it was the day Chandler was going back to his family's home!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina sat in the car, watching the red dot on her phone move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Chandler is always careful, he probably didn't suspect her of intentionally leaving a stuffed toy in his car, which had a tracking device inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she couldn't ask for Hunter's family's address, with the tracking device, she could naturally find Hunter's family's home!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">-"If you really want to understand Chandler, then go to his family's home, maybe everything will become clear!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weldon's words were like the temptation of a devil, making her wonder what Chandler was really up to and what she needed to understand about him?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And why won't his family let her in? Why does she have to get married first?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This curiosity was like a seed planted in her heart, and it kept growing stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, she couldn't resist the temptation and intentionally left the stuffed toy with the tracking device in Chandler's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, everything is going according to her plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Tina watched the car finally come to a stop at a point outside Emerald City, she took a deep breath and started the car, driving in that direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the distance, it would take about an hour and a half to drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she arrived near Hunter's home, she would find a hidden place to park and sneak in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was Tina's plan at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, Chandler got out of the car and looked at the century-old mansion in front of him, exuding a cold and eerie feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every time he came here, he felt an indescribable sense of oppression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was like being weighed down by something heavy, making it hard for him to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only when he was with Tina did that heavy sense of oppression disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being with Tina made him feel relaxed and at ease, making him feel like a normal person again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Young master, you're back." Hunter's servants lined up to welcome Chandler's arrival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where's the old man?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Over by the church," the servant replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler pursed his lips and walked towards the direction of the church.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hunter's church, where they prayed for Hunter's enemy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it should be said that it was a woman whom one of Hunter's ancestors had once loved, but for various reasons, the two eventually went their separate ways.</p></div>
