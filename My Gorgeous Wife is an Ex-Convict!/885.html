        <h1>Chapter 884</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason got out of the car. Outside the bar, he could hear the commotion and screams coming from inside. He could not help furrowing his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence only looked carefully at his boss' expression before saying, "Master Reed, there are a lot of people in there. Why don't I... go in and bring Miss Cummins out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'll go in myself." Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another silver Porsche zoomed up and stopped in front of the bar. In the next moment, a lanky figure got out of the Porsche.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was stunned when he saw Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was also a little shocked when he saw him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men looked at each other, engaging in an intimidating staredown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Terrence could not help wanting to laugh. After all, it was rare to see something like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you here for Lina?" Finally, Jason was the first to break the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's eyes lit up. "Are you here for... Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's each take our own woman home later," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Alright, it looks like Jason is really looking out for Grace,&rsquo; Hadwin thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had rushed here because Lina was so excited that she took a picture of the stage and posted it to her Instagram.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as he saw it, he immediately looked at the location below the photo she sent and asked someone to find out the specific address. Then, he rushed over here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman kept telling him she had a project to work on, so she could not meet him this weekend. It turned out she was here looking at handsome men in high spirits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought of the caption she posted with the picture&mdash;"I got to see five handsome men today! What do I do? I like all five of them!"&mdash;made Hadwin's teeth feel sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'All five? Didn't she say I'm the only one she likes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The little liar! Let's see how I'll punish her later!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, he had thought she sneaked in here all by herself. However, it seemed that she had dragged Grace along with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Hadwin did not expect to meet Jason at the bar's entrance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Our own woman?" Hadwin suddenly smiled faintly. "I seem to recall Grace breaking up with you, so she's not exactly yours anymore, Master Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Hadwin finished speaking, Jason's expression changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Turning around coldly, Jason went straight into the bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin touched his nose and followed suit, hoping Lina was not enjoying herself too much! 'She already has me, yet she's still interested in other men!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll make sure she clarifies who's the man she likes!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bar was full of loud voices, women's screams, deGracetions of love, men's hoarse singing, and music that all blended into a cacophony.</p></div>
