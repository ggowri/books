        <h1>Chapter 2622</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I did some basic research on you. After all, there are some basic facts about you that I need to be aware of if we're really going to date," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was silent. 'So, he knows all my basic information? Is that why he could call out my name in front of Raymond Bowman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who the hell are you?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She recognized the logo of the car they were in. It was a Cayenne, which was not cheap. It was not something ordinary working-class people could afford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He managed to find out all her basic information in only one day after she agreed to be his girlfriend. She could tell he was no ordinary man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do I spell that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"G-U-L-I-C-H-E-N," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sounds like a nice name," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced at the person next to him. Judging from her expression, she must have never heard of the name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? The surname Hart is one of the top ten surnames for male protagonists in romance novels," she thought of a post she had seen before and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Surnames for male protagonists?" He was slightly surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, many writers like to give their male protagonists the surname Hart," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a little twinkle in his eye. &lsquo;Male protagonists&rsquo; surname? But I&rsquo;ll only be a supporting role in Grace's story.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a sudden silence in the car, and a depressing atmosphere spread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did I... say the wrong thing?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." He gave a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated slightly before saying, "Do you really want to date me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you think I was joking yesterday?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't know anything about you!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, project leader. I live in Emerald City and am the only child in my family. My parents are still alive and healthy..." He introduced himself simply without any superfluous details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller listened carefully and realized the car had stopped at a restaurant&rsquo;s entrance when he was done speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn't seem to eat much just now. Let's eat here. The food in this restaurant is pretty delicious," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, sure," replied Valda Theller as she followed Brian out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The restaurant manager evidently knew Brian. As soon as they saw Brian, they approached him passionately and said, "Mr. Hart, you came. Do you want the same private room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, give me the same private room," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager led the way. Once Valda Theller followed Brian into the private room, she realized it was large. Besides the dining table, there was also a couch, coffee table, pool table, electronic screen, and so on. It was enough to hold a small party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she opened the menu and looked at the food, the prices stated almost shocked her so much that she did not have the heart to order anything.</p></div>
