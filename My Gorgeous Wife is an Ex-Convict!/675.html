        <h1>Chapter 674</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got up feeling sore, then she washed up. She was about to go downstairs when her phone rang. It was from Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Grace answered the call, Stella Lindsay's voice sounded into the phone. "Are you free today, Grace? I want to talk to you face to face about something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it for a moment and said, "Sure, let's meet up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Coincidentally, she also wanted to ask Stella Lindsay about the name Bryn and what she said to her about saving Brian when he was a child. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace met Stella Lindsay, she was dressed in the latest collection of a luxury brand. She was carrying a crocodile bag and wearing a pair of seven-inch high heels. Her hair was curled sophisticatedly, she had on delicate makeup and a pair of dark glasses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked like a socialite from the city. Who would have thought that Stella Lindsay used to be an ordinary housewife from a small town?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, Grace. There you are!" Stella Lindsay stepped forward, took off her sunglasses, and said to Grace with a smile, "Speaking of which, we rarely get together like this. I plan to stay here in Emerald City, so we can see each other more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Stella Lindsay. She did not think Stella Lindsay asked her out today due to their sisterhood. Her cousin had not been on good terms with her since childhood, let alone after they grew up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the time of her accident, it was said that Stella had been making fun of her imprisonment in town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you have anything to say to me, just say so," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on Stella Lindsay's face stiffened as she sat down and said in a hushed voice, "Then I'll just say it. I came to see you today to talk to you about Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart fluttered. 'What a coincidence.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you were so sudden the other day. Why did you call Brian that so suddenly? You and Jason are now a couple. People would misunderstand you easily when you call Brian by such intimate terms," said Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you really tell me about how you saved Brian when you were little? Besides, did you tell me about the name Bryn as well?" Grace got straight to the point and asked what puzzled her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay stiffened and tried to suppress the fear surging from her heart. She said to Grace, "What are you talking about? Would I lie to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just thought if you really told me, why don&rsquo;t I remember it?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay replied, "Who would remember clearly what they said when they were little? Children forget a lot of things they say. Can you remember everything we said when we were little?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned. "So it was you who saved Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course!" Stella Lindsay said angrily. She was angry that she was being questioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why don't you tell me how you saved Brian again?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although angry, Stella Lindsay did tell Grace what happened. She added at the end, "It's been so many years since this happened that I've forgotten some of the scenes, but it's more or less that way. I've told you whatever you want to know. Now that you have Jason, I hope you can keep your distance from Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her coldly.</p></div>
