        <h1>Chapter 3707</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as his hand was about to pull her hand off his neck, her previously closed eyes had opened and were staring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was stunned, and at this moment, time seemed to stand still. All his attention seemed to be drawn to her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were still hazy with drunkenness. At this moment, she was still drunk and not sober.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason..." her murmured voice rang out leisurely, "Is... is it you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his thin lips and did not answer her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She squinted her eyes hard, as if trying to see him clearly. Then her hand slowly moved from his neck to his cheek, her fingers slowly stroking his cheek as if trying to feel his face and bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... should be Mason, should be..." she muttered, "Do you know? I miss you so much. I know I shouldn't have blamed you back then. Later, I thought a lot..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thought a lot?" His cold voice finally sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes... thought a lot..." she murmured, her face getting closer to his, and her drunken eyes widening as if trying to see him more clearly, "I thought... I was afraid... afraid that the balance between us would be broken, afraid that in the end, we couldn't even be... siblings. But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly laughed again, but her laughter seemed bitter. "But in the end...if we can't be siblings, we can't even be friends..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you regret it, don't you?" he stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." she opened her mouth. Suddenly, she flipped over and pressed him down beneath her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fingers were still feeling his face, and in this position, it seemed easier for her to see his face clearly. "I regret it. I shouldn't have hurt you like that...if I could go back in time, that would be great..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her voice fell, her head fell heavily on his chest, and she fell asleep again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because of her words, he was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was someone he shouldn't care about, so why didn't he push her away just now? He even let her touch his face and said a bunch of nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether she regrets it or not is meaningless now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He should push her away now and leave, but...everything is in chaos again after meeting her again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt her head throbbing. Why was her head hurting so much? Right, she drank a lot of alcohol yesterday, and then...she wanted to leave, but Crispin chased after her and grabbed her. She wanted to struggle, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her hand seemed to touch something, it was...another person's body?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica shuddered. Did Crispin...do something to her last night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she opened her eyes, she saw Mason's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica blinked in confusion. Was she dreaming? She actually dreamed of Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like before, Mason used to love lying on her bed, holding her intimately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene before her seemed so unreal that she reached out her hand and trembled as she touched the other person's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before her fingers could touch the cheek, a hand suddenly grabbed hers, preventing her from moving forward.</span></p></div>
