        <h1>Chapter 3169</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the elderly Mr. Hart and Mrs. Hart also walked over. "What's going on? What happened?" they asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, Mom," Brian turned to his parents, "You know how important Valda is to me. If anyone tries to ruin the relationship between me and Valda, they will be crossing a line and I won't let it go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, the elderly Mr. and Mrs. Hart glanced at their son's serious expression and then at Auntie Sandy and Lexi standing nearby. They understood to some extent what might happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, before Brian arrived, some of Lexi's words were filled with disdain towards Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart thought that the child was only speaking like this in front of their own family, and would not do anything in front of Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it seems that we were thinking too optimistically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, get out of here!" Brian looked at Lexi again and spoke in a cold tone, making it clear that there was no room for argument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi's face was pale and she looked at old Mr. Hart and old Mrs. Hart with pleading eyes. "Uncle and Aunt, I really just said a few words casually. I only mentioned that Miss Theller did a good job saving Grace's child. I didn't say much else. I don't understand why Brian got angry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, Lexi is still trying to argue and make excuses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Lexi mentioned the name Grace, both Mr. and Mrs. Hart's expressions changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Hart has been in the business world for many years, while Mrs. Hart has been the head of the household for just as long. It's likely that they can both guess what Lexi said, and their expressions turned unpleasant as a result.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fact that their son couldn't win Grace's heart for so many years has been a constant worry for the Hart family. Now that their son has finally fallen in love with Valda, they fear that any further complications could delay his marriage and starting a family for who knows how long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Hart immediately spoke up, "Sister, you better take your Lexi home. I don't think Lexi should come here again in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Auntie Sandy was shocked to hear this and said, "Big sister, what do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, show them out," Mrs. Hart ordered the servant standing nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The servant immediately walked up to Auntie Sandy's family and gestured to show them out, saying, "Please."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big sister, we've been relatives for so many years. Lexi just said a few words to an outsider. Do you really..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Outsider?" Mrs. Hart said coldly, "Valda is my future daughter-in-law, not an outsider. And in the future, Valda will be the mistress of the Hart family. Since your daughter Lexi doesn't know how to respect Valda, there's no need for her to come here again! You can leave now. You can come back in the future, but your daughter is not welcome! Show them out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Hart shouted "show them out" for the second time. Auntie Sandy realized that they were in the wrong and could only grit her teeth and leave with her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other relatives in the room understood the Hart family's importance of Valda and became even more enthusiastic towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked down at Valda and hesitated, "No matter what Lexi said earlier, don't take it to heart, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda readily agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her straightforwardness instead caused a hint of worry to rise in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the elderly Mrs. Hart approached and said, "Valda, come here, I want to talk to you for a moment."</p></div>
