        <h1>Chapter 1217</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace subconsciously wanted to escape Jason's arms, but he held her a little tighter instead. His nose was full of her scent. He even took it in greedily, and once his hands embraced her, they did not seem to want to let go anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How long was she going to influence him for? All his reason and insistence seemed to crush easily when it came to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the one in distress right now, but why did he feel like he was the one utterly defeated? He even... abandoned his armor and surrendered?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held her with his face buried deep in her shoulders as if to hold her forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Doesn&rsquo;t he hate me? He hates me to the point of disdain, so why is he hugging me now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... can give you two million dollars." Finally, Jason's thin lips parted gently and a hoarse voice escaped his mouth. "I can also find better hospitals and doctors to treat Lina. I can even pay for all of Lina's treatment expenses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes widened, and she could hardly believe what she heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did... Did he say... he'll save Lina?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Re-Really?" Her lips trembled as she choked, afraid that he was only giving her another glimmer of hope so that he could crush it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you can sacrifice everything for Lina, then... let's get married," he murmured, never thinking that one day he would have to make such an offer just to marry her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at Jason, finding everything so unreal. 'What did he say? Get married? He wants to marry me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to... marry me?" she asked blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you willing to do anything for Lina? Then it won't be difficult for you to marry me," he said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's not difficult, but I don't get it. Shouldn't he hate me? Didn't he just tell me that I have no room for regrets? But why is his attitude so different after I woke up?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why... do you want to marry me?" muttered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you're pregnant now. 13 weeks along. I don't want my child to be a b*stard," he said, unwilling to admit that he could not get over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she fainted in front of him, he felt a panic he had never felt before. At that moment, his only thought was that nothing could happen to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If something did happen to her, what would he do? How was he going to live his life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he could keep her out of his heart, but it turned out it was hard not to love someone after you had fallen for them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was utterly dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if one shock after another had come to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm pregnant? I have a baby in my tummy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's already widened eyes widened even more. She looked at Jason and lowered her head to look at her belly. She was lost in such extreme shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I going to be a mother and have a child of my blood?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Am I... really pregnant?" she asked in a trembling voice, afraid she had misheard it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do I have to deceive you? Or do you think I&rsquo;m lying about your pregnancy because I want to marry you?" he asked with a hint of sarcasm.</p></div>
