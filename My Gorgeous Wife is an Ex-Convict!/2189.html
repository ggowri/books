        <h1>Chapter 2187</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper finally apologized after wanting to do it for a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She also said that she always thought of him when she ate and slept. She did not even find chocolate appealing anymore because he was gone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She babbled childishly, confusing the maid nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What is she talking about...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Brother and I came with our parents to see you this time. Why didn&rsquo;t you come see us? I was so disappointed that I didn't see you at noon today. I almost cried!" said Jasper as she pouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William pressed his lips together tightly. His father did tell him they were coming to Deer City and asked if he wanted to meet them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wanted to see Jasper, but... he was afraid that she would look at him like he was a naughty child when they met and she would want him to go back to apologize to Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, he told his father that he was not going and wanted to attend his class instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not expect Jasper to appear in front of him like this and tell him such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You... know I didn't push Nelson Corbyn down the stairs?" William asked after a long while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, didn't your daddy tell you? The police found out that someone shot an air gun in Nelson&rsquo;s direction. Fortunately, you pushed Nelson away. Otherwise, Nelson would have been seriously injured," said Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked confused. His father did not tell him this when he came back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, stop being mad at me, okay? I'll... believe you from now on. I'll believe you no matter what happens. Brother wants to apologize to you too. Let's go find Brother!" said Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper grabbed William's hand and ran out of the storeroom. However, when they reached the living room in the main house, there was already a row of servants and security guards standing there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides them, the owners of the Barlow family&mdash;Charlie Barlow, Chelsea, and Philip Barlow&mdash;were here too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Panic flashed across Jasper Reed's little face as she gripped William tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chelsea frowned as she looked at the little girl standing next to her grandson. Chelsea only thought the little girl had humiliated the Barlow family when she made such a scene in the residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All those grown-ups could not even catch a little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is this Jason's daughter?" Chelsea asked unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, she's called Jasper Reed." Philip Barlow smiled and said to Jasper Reed, "Little girl, it's inappropriate to break into my home like this. Didn't your parents teach you to tell the host in advance if you want to visit them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just wanted to see William," said Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow said, "Now that you've seen him, can you let go? And where's your brother? You must have come with your brother. Where&rsquo;s your brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper immediately grasped William's hand tighter. Then, she pressed her lips together tightly to show that she would not say a word.</p></div>
