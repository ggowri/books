        <h1>Chapter 3461</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica and Daniel entered the temple, but since it was not allowed to light incense inside the hall, they just paid their respects without doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica is looking at the majestic Buddha statue in front of her, with her hands clasped together and her eyes closed, praying sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Daniel stood on the side, staring blankly at Veronica, feeling as if the distance between them was growing farther and farther.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How should he bring it up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he really said these words, how would she look at him? Would she think that he was only dating her for some ulterior motive?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica opened her eyes and looked at Daniel, she said in a slightly strange way, "Why do you look a bit weird?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Strange?" Daniel was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, the way you're looking at me seems cautious, like you have something to say," Veronica said. "If you do have something to say to me, why not just say it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I don't really have anything to say," Daniel chuckled nervously and said, "I was just curious about what wishes you made earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "I can't say that. Don't they say that wishes won't come true if you speak them out loud?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wish she just made was for a smooth relationship with Daniel and for Mason to be safe, healthy, and happier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel didn't ask any more questions and continued to accompany Veronica as they walked around the temple. However, in the end, he didn't say the words he wanted to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Daniel returned home, he was met with the anxious faces of his parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daniel, how did Zixi say it? When did she bring this up with Mason?" asked Mr. Cross anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't talk to Veronica," said Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, you didn't say?" Old Mr. Cross looked surprised and then scolded, "How could you not say it? Do you... do you want me to go to jail?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Daniel, this matter cannot be delayed!" Mrs. Cross, the elderly woman, repeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I understand. I will go talk to Veronica about this," Daniel promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the next day, when he arrived at the entrance of the Barlow family's neighborhood, he was invited to a private room in a hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person in the private room was none other than Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, why do you suddenly want to see me, and... um, in a place like this?" Daniel asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, his family was in dire need of a business deal with the Reed family, and the person he had originally planned to ask for help from, Veronica, was now standing in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why did you go to the Barlow family?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel became even more nervous, "I... I just wanted to find Veronica..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it because of your father's embezzlement?" Mason asked calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he said this, Daniel was stunned, his pupils suddenly contracted, and he looked at the person in front of him in disbelief!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He... actually knew!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the problem was... how did he know?! Could this be the Reed family's Mason? Even secrets from other families could be easily known.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Am I wrong?" Mason's expression remained unchanged, in stark contrast to Daniel's shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why...how do you know?" Daniel murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I not only know about your father's corruption, but I also know that someone is using your father's name to pursue a business deal under the guise of the Reed family," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's throat felt a burning sensation as he realized that the things he had been carefully considering were already known by the other party.</p></div>
