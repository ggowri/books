        <h1>Chapter 2200</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm already back, but I have something to take care of in the office. It's urgent, so I'm not going home tonight. I'll be back tomorrow. You should rest early. Don't exhaust yourself!" said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, okay. By the way, do you want to make a video call so I can show you Tina?" said Lina. Since Tina was born, Hadwin Stephenson would make video calls to see their daughter whenever he took a break from work in the office. Lina could foresee that her husband would probably dote on their daughter very much in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson said, "No thanks. I can see her when I get home tomorrow anyway. I have a lot of work to do right now, so I'm going to hang up." With that said, he ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at the phone in her hand and somehow felt a surge of uneasiness course within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She thought that he was acting a little strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He usually seemed as if he could not get enough of their daughter. Besides that, his voice sounded a little strange on the phone. It was also vaguer than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina held the phone in her hand tightly and suddenly got up. She told several nurses, "Take good care of Little Young Lady. I'm going out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, Young Madam," the maids answered quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, Lina left hurriedly, telling the driver to go to the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When they arrived at the building of Stephenson Group in Emerald City, Lina rushed in. The security guard on duty hurriedly walked over at the sight of Lina. "Young Madam, Hello."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is the president here?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," the security guard responded as he went to the elevator with Lina and helped her press the elevator button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina entered the elevator. It was already evening. Besides some employees working overtime and those who were still on duty, there were not many people. When she arrived at the floor where Hadwin Stephenson's office was, only one secretary was still on duty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is the president in his office?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," the secretary said. However, when she saw Lina heading toward the president&rsquo;s office, she quickly said, "But the president has ordered not to let anyone go in and disturb him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze. The uneasiness in her heart spread because of what the secretary said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't worry, I'll take responsibility if anything happens. He won't blame you!" said Lina. Then, she headed to the president's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The secretary did not stop her. After all, Young Madam was usually an exception for the president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina gently pushed the office door open. However, to her surprise, it was dark in the office and no lights were on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In other words, Hadwin was not working in the office at all? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina closed the door. Her hand fumbled around the wall for the switch. She flipped it on and turned on the lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The room lit up instantly. Then, there was an angry shout. "Get out! I told you, no one can enter without my permission!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked up and saw that Hadwin Stephenson was sitting on the couch instead of at his desk. He had his head down and seemed to be filled with dejection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Are you in a bad mood?" asked Lina.</p></div>
