        <h1>Chapter 2016</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," Philip Barlow said and ended the phone call. He opened the car door, got out of the car, and walked toward the tiny figure in the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Philip Barlow approached his son and the woman who helped him make the phone call, the woman was surprised as if she had not expected the father to come so quickly. He was so... handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you. I've come to pick up my son," Philip Barlow said to the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You... You're welcome." The woman blushed a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow took William's hand and said, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one obediently followed his father to the car parked nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they got into the car, Philip Barlow seemed to say nonchalantly, "What's the matter? Have you decided to return to Deer City with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one shook his head. "I... I want to borrow some money from you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Borrow money?" He seemed to have heard a funny joke. "You're asking me to lend you money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah," the little one responded uncomfortably. His pearly white teeth were biting his lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow stared at him. "If you're asking me to lend you money, how are you going to pay me back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Embarrassment flashed across William's face. 'Yeah, how am I going to pay him back? I can't make money at all!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if he wanted to earn money by performing like buskers, he had no piano!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll lend you the money if you return to Deer City with me," said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Return to Deer City?' His little body stiffened, and he shook his head firmly. "I... I'm not going to Deer City." He wanted to stay with Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you want to stay with the Reed family so badly? What good will it do for you when you're so dependent on others' charity and can't even afford to buy a present?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was instantly surprised when Philip Barlow said this, and his beautiful dark eyes opened wide to look at the man in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Didn't you ask me to lend you money so you could buy Jasper a birthday present ?" Philip Barlow asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William asked in a mutter, "How... do you know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm your father. Of course, I know what you're thinking. Now, what are you going to do if I won't lend you the money? What will Jasper think of you when you can't even get her a presentable gift?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one lowered his head and was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, you've been out long enough. I'll send you back. Otherwise, the kindergarten teacher will worry," said Philip Barlow before ordering the driver to drive to the kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When William returned to the kindergarten, the teacher had noticed that he was missing and was checking the surveillance footage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as Jasper saw him come back, she rushed to him and hugged him. "William, why did you go outside? Didn't the teacher tell us that we can&rsquo;t go outside alone? We'll get kidnapped by bad people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I..." William was silent, too embarrassed to say that he wanted to see what presents he could buy for her. However, they all cost a lot of money and he was broke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Jasper noticed Philip Barlow. "Thank you for bringing William back, Uncle."</p></div>
