        <h1>Chapter 1997</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The Tang family was found to be cutting corners in a property development project. Relevant authorities in tMason Swansonty had decided to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This property development project was the Tang family's key project in the past two years. Since tMason Swansonty authorities wanted a thorough investigation, it was necessary to stop work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Since they had to stop working, the pre-sale a month later would also have to be suspended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even after the rectification, it was unclear how sales would fare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If sales were bad, fund recovery would be slower than expected and the entire Keller Group might be dragged down by the chain reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The expressions of the Tang family changed, and Monica Keller was shocked. She had no idea about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At the board meeting, everyone's phones were turned off and not brought into the meeting room. Hence, Monica Keller could not even make a phone call to find out what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I didn't know about the news until this morning either. If you want to save the Tang family, you should sell the shares of Stephenson Group you have in hand. Otherwise, once the Tang family's capital chain is cut off, it won't be a question of whether the Tang family can get a slice of the cake but whether you&rsquo;ll be destroyed entirely," Hadwin Stephenson said nonchalantly as if everything was in his anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For a moment, Monica Keller could sort of understand how Katherine Jackson had felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This man could unexpectedly corner you into doing what he wanted you to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even if they have to sell, I can buy the Tang family's shares," said Emily Flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson glanced at his mother. "Mom, I'm afraid you can't take those shares with the money you have, or are you going to keep on giving the Tang family empty promises and buy those shares in installments?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." Emily Flowers glared at her son fiercely. "Okay, then let's bid for it and see who the Tang family is willing to sell to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I never said anything about bidding against you! If the Tang family wants to buy my shares, then the price is up to me. If the Tang family doesn't want to sell, it doesn't matter either. The Tang family can just keep holding on to their shares," said Hadwin Stephenson as he took out a statement of agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers frowned. "What's this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's a joint multi-party agreement between me and some shareholders of Stephenson Group to freeze their shares and set up a holding company. The holding company's shares have exceeded 51%, so you and the Tang family don't stand a chance!" said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers instantly jumped out of her chair and glared at her son in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was the son she had high hopes for. She had changed her fate with this child but never expected him to cause her downfall!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When her son brought down the Jackson family, she found that her son's scheming mind was far beyond her imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she thought that her partnership and the Tang family would be enough to defeat her son. After all, it was more realistic to have power in your own hands than in others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... she now had no chance to turn the tables.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With a sullen look on her face, Emily Flowers turned around to leave the meeting room. She had no reason to stay here any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just when she nearly reached the door, Hadwin Stephenson's cold voice came from behind. "By the way, my dear mother, the meeting will be over in a short while. I still have some things to discuss with you. Why don't you wait for me outside?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers looked embarrassed as she stomped her heels and left the meeting room.</p></div>
