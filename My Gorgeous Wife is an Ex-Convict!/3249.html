        <h1>Chapter 3247</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the end of the day when the shooting was over, Kyla was still a bit dazed and wondered, "Is it over just like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the end also means... the time to release from hypnosis is getting closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Martin was driving back to the mansion, Kyla said, "Tonight, I booked a suite at the hotel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you book a room?" He paused, looking at her with surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Today, I wore a wedding dress, so I want to spend a night with you in the hotel, as a way to make up for our wedding night. Will you refuse such a small request?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That mom and Nelson, they..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have told my mom that she should tell Nelson that you went on a business trip today and I accompanied you, and that we will be back tomorrow," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like you have everything arranged. Which hotel are we staying at?" Martin asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla mentioned the name of a famous upscale hotel in Emerald City, which Martin already knows the location of, so there's no need for Kyla to provide the specific address again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin looked at the car while Kyla tilted her head and stared straight at Martin's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, the car stopped at a red light at a four-way intersection. Martin turned to Kyla and asked, "What's wrong? Is there something on my face? You've been staring at me since earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I just really wanted to look at you a little more," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" he raised an eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated for a moment and said, "Well, you can understand it as... you're very handsome, so I want to look at you more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He chuckled, "I'm already at this age, what's so handsome about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he has entered middle age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're still very handsome, the charm of a mature man," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes narrowed slightly, as if he was thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" She suddenly felt a sense of guilt, as if his gaze had seen through something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just feel like you're a bit different today," he said as the traffic light turned green and he started driving again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's different?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I feel like today, you're starting to resemble the you that I first met," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't help but fall silent. In truth, the her from back then was the most authentic version of herself. But later on, due to the harsh realities of life, she quickly changed herself and gradually forgot what her original personality was like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And today, she wanted to show him the original version of herself that she was when they first met!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at the hotel, Kyla had booked the presidential suite and also ordered dinner, which was delivered by the hotel staff to their room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even specially ordered scented candles, which made him feel nostalgic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He remembered that when they were dating, she would always arrange candlelit dinners whenever she wanted a romantic meal. He never expected that after so many years, he would once again enjoy a candlelit dinner arranged by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he was happy to accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The dinner made them feel like they had gone back in time to their early days together. After they finished eating, Kyla took out her phone and played some music, filling the room with a melodious tune.</p></div>
