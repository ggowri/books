        <h1>Chapter 725</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her uneasiness seemed to be heightened by his fragility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you saying that all of a sudden?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Say you'll never betray me, okay?" His voice was already hoarse, and it sounded a lot like a plea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, other than anxiety, she felt a pang in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's Jason! Why would he use such a tone to beg me to never betray him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked past him to see the memorial tablet behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew it was his father's memorial tablet. The man with gentle eyes chose death because the one he loved abandoned him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That... Was a betrayal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father was betrayed by his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he was betrayed by his father who left him alone in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were still fixed on her, waiting for her to give him an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her nose felt sore. He seemed to get whatever he wanted, but who knew he had such a deep trauma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she just wanted to calm his vulnerability and trauma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ll never betray you," her eyes returned to his face to meet his eyes as she said in a tone of great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" he murmured, his voice sounding so soft.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really," she answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, his cheek brushed against her palm as if the warmth of her hand could warm the cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not know how miserable he had felt when he stood before his father's memorial tablet just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after so many years, his father's incident was still so bloody cruel to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father had said, "Jason, don't love someone the way I did. If you love someone too much, you'll only hurt yourself in the end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with someone, and I love her deeply, Dad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides, Grace is unlike Mom, so I won't end up like you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'We won't end up the same!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then, you must remember what you promised me tonight," he muttered, kissing her on the palm. "Grace, I won&rsquo;t be able to take it if you betray me." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If she really betrays me one day, I don't know what I would do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe&hellip; I'll destroy her too!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace woke up the next day, Jason was no longer in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She frowned when she thought of how he made her promise never to betray him last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He might seem strong, but he was more insecure than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe when we're spending time together, I should say more I love yous to make him feel more secure?' thought Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the reminder alarm on her phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the schedule on her phone and got up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost forgot that she had made an appointment with the psychiatrist with the last name Leng today.</p></div>
