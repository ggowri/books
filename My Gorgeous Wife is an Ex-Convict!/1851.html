        <h1>Chapter 1849</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, the weather was getting colder now, so it was not unusual that Grace was wearing a turtleneck sweater.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... for some reason, Grace still felt uneasy when she thought of Jay&rsquo;s unusual reaction yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Yesterday was not a day for mourning, but Jay went to the mourning hall and mentioned his mother. He was obviously not in the right mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she did not manage to find out what had happened that made him suddenly go to the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, Grace!" Old Lawyer Watts's voice rang out in Grace's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace snapped back to her senses. "Ah, Mentor. What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is Jason... not coming today?" asked Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jason has a meeting this morning, so he might be late. Let's enter the cemetery first," said Grace. The car had stopped in front of the Reed family's cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright," said Old Lawyer Watts as he helped Mrs. Watts out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts had not said a word since she left the hospital today. Mrs. Watts stopped dead in her tracks in front of the entrance of the cemetery while staring blankly at the gate. Her eyes reddened. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Watts, why did you stop?" Grace asked aloud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah, n-nothing. Let's go in," Mrs. Watts said, sounding like there was a slight lump in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts patted his wife on the shoulder as if comforting her or reminding her of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace led the two into the cemetery and arrived at her father-in-law's grave. There was a black and white photo of her father-in-law when he was young on the tombstone. The man in the photo had a slight smile on his lips and appeared as gentle as water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Time also seemed to freeze in the black and white photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the person in the photo, Mrs. Watts suddenly burst out into tears with a cry as if she could no longer control her emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was instantly at a loss. "Mrs. Watts, what's come over you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Mrs. Watts only continued to cry. She was almost kneeling in front of the tombstone. Her cries sounded sad and mournful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She probably recalled one of her friends... She had a friend who died young too, so she's a little emotionally unstable," explained Old Lawyer Watts. Then, he crouched down to comfort his crying wife, saying, "Stop crying. It's over. It's all over now. You were just discharged. You're going to exhaust yourself with all the crying, and your leg will probably take longer to recover."</p></div>
