        <h1>Chapter 1338</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss thought about Kyla Corbyn's messy hair, bruised face, and thin figure all night. He could not get the image out of his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's wrong with me? Why am I thinking about Kyla Corbyn so much these days?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she handed Nelson to him in three months, he would have nothing to do with this woman anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chairman Ye? What do you think of this proposal? Chairman Ye?" His subordinate's voice suddenly interrupted his trance, and he finally came back to his senses. He saw that he was in a meeting room where he was in a meeting with the company's senior management.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll look over this proposal and discuss it later. Let's dismiss the meeting first," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Dismiss?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The senior executives looked at each other. 'Didn't he say the proposal has to be perfected in today's meeting?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, since their boss had already said so, then the others had nothing else to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They gathered their papers and filed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, Martin Weiss said to the secretary nearby, "You get out too. I want to be alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the secretary replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When only Martin Weiss was left in the meeting room, a trace of fatigue and struggle finally appeared on his face. He raised his hand and covered his forehead. "Kyla Corbyn..." His thin lips uttered the name through clenched teeth, but it sounded aggrieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was lying in bed, barely wanting to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the hospital had said she only had superficial wounds, every bone of and every inch of her muscle were in pain right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doorbell rang. 'Did Mom leave her keys behind?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn struggled to open her eyes and then shuffled to get out of bed. However, as soon as her feet touched the ground, her legs gave way and she nearly fell over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough... her body was unlike before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when she was beaten in prison previously, she would not be this weak the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doorbell continued to ring, and it sounded urgent. Kyla Corbyn went to the door and opened it. However, she did not expect to see Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, she was a little stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at Kyla Corbyn with displeasure. "Why did you take so long to open the door?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn had the urge to laugh. "Mr. Weiss, this is my home. I can open the door whenever I want. I can even choose not to open the door."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together tightly and looked at her with those deep penetrating eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was not as bruised and swollen as the night before, but she looked very pale. She was wearing worn-out pajamas, and her hair was a little unkempt. She had obviously been sleeping earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stretched his long legs and walked into the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "This is my home. I didn't allow you to come in, did I? Please get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your home?" Martin Weiss suddenly smiled sarcastically. "Believe it or not, I can ask the landlord to break the contract and rent the house to me right away. What you call 'your home' can become 'my home' right away."</p></div>
