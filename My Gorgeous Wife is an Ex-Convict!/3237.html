        <h1>Chapter 3235</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her steadily, his eyes flickering slightly, and said, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla breathed a sigh of relief, fearing he might refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go," she said, taking his hand and leading him towards the parking area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He paused for a moment, his feet coming to a stop, and stared blankly at the hand that was being held.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla turned her head to follow the other person's gaze and said, "Martin, I just don't want to waste any more time between us. We're not young anymore, and we've spent so many years in those ups and downs. Now, I just want us to be like a normal couple, able to stroll around, watch movies, and chat casually."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their lives have already passed halfway, and the remaining time should be cherished every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin didn't say anything else, he just lifted his feet and followed Kyla to their car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the car arrived at the underground parking lot of tMason Swansonnema, Martin took the initiative to hold Kyla's hand as they got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, it was Kyla's turn to be stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin said, "As you said, we are not young anymore, and we really shouldn't waste any more time. Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla smiled and felt the warmth of the hand holding hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them took the elevator and arrived at the movie theater where they bought their tickets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While waiting to enter, Martin held Kyla's hand the whole time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although holding hands in a movie theater is quite normal, after all, many couples come to tMason Swansonnema.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Martin himself is already quite good-looking, and coupled with the fact that there are more young people than middle-aged people in this cinema, holding hands like this actually attracts attention in a strange way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many young women looked towards them, and some even whispered envious comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, how sweet!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They must be very loving! I wish my future husband could hold my hand like that too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha, who knows if she's the other woman!" Some discordant voices also chimed in, "Usually, married couples don't hold hands like this. It's usually when there's someone else outside that they do this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, before the person could finish speaking, Martin's cold gaze swept over them, causing the rest of their words to get stuck in their throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin walked towards the person, and Kyla followed him because they were holding hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Martin?" Kyla asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I saw Martin standing in front of the person who had just spoken, and he said coldly, "This is my wife. If I hear any more false statements from you that defame my wife and me, we'll see each other in court."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the other person heard Martin's words, their face changed and their mouth moved, but in the end, they didn't say anything. Instead, they walked away dejectedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla looked at Martin strangely. In the past, if he heard people say things like this, he might not have bothered to pay attention. But today, he walked straight up to the person and warned them.</p></div>
