        <h1>Chapter 3280</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I don't need to go to the hospital. I just need to rest for a while," Lawrence quickly said. "Earlier, did I play badly? If I rest for a bit, I can play well again without making mistakes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your hands are like this, how can you play? Of course, you need to go to the hospital right away," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence, hands are very important. If there is any problem with your hands, you won't be able to play beautiful music. So, listen to me and go to the hospital to have a doctor check your hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper called for the butler and together they accompanied Lawrence to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After examining, the doctor concluded that playing the piano too much has caused some damage to the ligaments in the wrist joint, and it is necessary to rest properly for a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you enjoy playing the piano, you must also know when to stop, especially since you are still young. It's important to be careful because if you develop any health problems now, it will be difficult to recover fully when you grow up," the doctor advised Lawrence with a serious tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence asked anxiously, "How long until I can play the piano again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At least take a break for two weeks first. After two weeks, come back for a follow-up to check on your recovery," said the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half a month? "Can't it be any shorter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor was amused by his bargaining behavior, "It's only half a month, it will pass quickly. Doing this will help you play the piano better in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if that's the case, he won't be able to practice the piano during this time and won't be able to see Jasper. Also, when he can practice the piano again, will he become unfamiliar with it and regress?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One worry after another, swirling around Lawrence's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the way back, Lawrence said to Jasper, "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you saying sorry?" Jasper asked strangely in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... If I can't practice the piano, then... then I won't be able to play it for you, even though we had agreed that I would play it for you often," he stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After you've healed, you can play for me often," Jasper said. "I should be the one apologizing for not noticing your injury. The doctor said your hand must have been hurting for a while now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's expression turned serious as he spoke, and he addressed Lawrence with great sincerity, saying, "Lawrence, I'm sorry! If I had been more attentive to you, I would have noticed your hand was hurting earlier!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her in a daze, never expecting her to apologize to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the future, you must take good care of your hands because they are the hands of a pianist, very important, very important!" said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pianist?" he murmured, never having thought of becoming one himself. He played the piano because he enjoyed it, and now he played it because he wanted to play for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because she truly enjoys listening to him play the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper said, 'The teacher said that if you continue to study hard, you will definitely become a great pianist in the future.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, will you also become a pianist?" Lawrence asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked his eyes and said, "I'm not sure. I really enjoy playing the piano, but I don't like performing like a pianist. What I love the most is playing the piano for someone I care about to listen to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's heart stirred at these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That... um, when you play the piano, do you... sometimes play for me? And, um, do you maybe... like me a little bit?" He stumbled over his words, blushing and looking like he couldn't quite get the whole sentence out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Jasper took the initiative to say, "Yeah, I like you, so I also like playing the piano for you to listen to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spoke openly and honestly, without any attempt to conceal anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His heart warmed up as he knew that she played the piano for many people she was close to, and she liked those people, especially Mr. Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She enjoys playing the piano for Mr. Barlow the most, so it seems that he is her favorite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he was also among the people she "liked", and that made him very happy! For him, this was a great satisfaction.</p></div>
