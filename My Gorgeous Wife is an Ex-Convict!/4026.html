        <h1>Chapter 4024</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandma, I need to go to Emerald City for treatment. If you want to go with me, I'll find a place for you to stay. If you don't want to go to a strange place, then I'll come back to see you when I'm better." Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If... she really dies with her unborn child, then she will leave all her savings to Miss Fowler, at least to ensure her retirement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I'm afraid I won't adapt to the big city. I still want to stay in the village for now." Miss Fowler said, "But I'm afraid I won't be able to visit you often when you're being treated in Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll buy you a smartphone and teach you how to make video calls. We can talk to each other through video calls frequently in the future." Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Miss Fowler didn't understand anything about smartphones, so Nancy explained to her in detail what video calls are.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Miss Fowler left, the doctor conducted a fetal heart rate test and some basic examinations on Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is the baby okay?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The baby is fine, but your condition is not good." The doctor said with a serious expression, "Your blood pressure is high now, and combined with your previous fall into the sea, your body is in a mess. Giving birth is just a gamble for your life. But in this world, not all gambles can be won. Many people lose their lives in gambling, you just haven't seen it yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know." Nancy said, "Doctor, I'm mentally prepared!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor sighed. As a doctor, he couldn't make decisions for his patients. He could only do his best to ensure their safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the doctor left, Jason and Grace walked into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason said to Nancy, "If your condition remains stable in a couple of days, we will take you back to Emerald City. Once you're there, you can consider whether or not to have an abortion. However, the longer you wait, the more damage it will cause to your body."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't consider having an abortion, so you don't need to say anything more. This child is mine alone!" Nancy said warily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she was like a hedgehog, raising all her spines to protect the child in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Regardless of whether this child is born or not, it is not just your child, but also the Reed family's child!" Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, his words made Nancy even more guarded!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace saw this and said to Jason, "You go out first. I'll talk to Nancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason nodded and left the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace said, "I'm sorry. My husband didn't mean any harm by what he said. He just wanted to explain that the Reed family also cares about the child in your belly. However, they care more about your safety than the child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Nancy's guarded expression gradually faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace sat down by the bedside and said, "Nancy, to me, you are my daughter's benefactor and my future daughter-in-law. I am grateful to you, cherish you, and understand you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was startled by Grace's words of "future daughter-in-law."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I'm not anyone's daughter-in-law..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you love Mick?" Grace asked.</p></div>
