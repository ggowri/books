        <h1>Chapter 4352 Drawing the Line</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing someone approaching, Laurel's expression changed again, revealing a beaming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley, let's have a meal together. As relatives, you wouldn't deny me this small favor, would you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disgust in Harley's eyes deepened. This Laurel was clearly trying to use her to show off. He had been going around the company claiming to be a relative of the Harley family, using this connection to gain advantages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the fact that the Blair family had once helped my grandmother, with their work capabilities, they would have been unable to stay in the corporation for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Harley still acting indifferent, Laurel once again reached out, trying to pull Harley towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Laurel's view, with others present, especially the children of the group's senior executives who had met Harley before, Harley naturally wouldn't make the situation awkward in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Harley obediently went to dinner with him, then naturally, the relationship between the Blair family and the Hart family would be further highlighted within the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Blair family, this was naturally a great opportunity to ride on someone else's coattails!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, now that Harley had broken off her engagement, it was common knowledge within the group. If Laurel could somehow manage to charm this princess of the Hart family, then his future would be on the up and up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the entire Hart family's estate would be his in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, the way Laurel looked at Harley became even more intense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What caught him off guard, however, was that Harley didn't seem to have any intention of saving his face at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My last name is Hart, yours is Blair. We're not related in any way. Even if your family and my grandmother's family are from the same village, there's no blood relation between us," Harley stated bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurel's face suddenly turned extremely unpleasant, and those who walked over looked at Laurel with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they often heard Laurel saying that the Blair family and the Hart family were relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because they cared about the familial ties between the Blair family and the Hart family that these people usually showed respect to Laurel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, how could a person with a low level of education, who came from a small village, possibly have been popular among the children of these middle-class elite families!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What...what did you say?" Laurel asked, her face turning red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've made myself perfectly clear. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop telling people we're related. We're not," Harley said, before turning to Calvert, who was standing there dumbfounded, and heading towards the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laurel was fuming with embarrassment. "Harley, you were dumped by Lornell, so you just picked up some random guy to keep, didn't you? If others found out that the princess of the Hart family is supporting a man, I wonder if it would make the headlines!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley paused, feeling the wrist he was holding stiffen incredibly. The owner of the wrist, at this moment, had a face as pale as a sheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley turned around, staring coldly at Laurel: "I didn't realize your mind was so filthy! Would I having a meal with my friend make the headlines? Filthy people think filthy thoughts. People like </span><span>you,</span><span> I hope to never see you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Harley said this, not only did Laurel's face change, but even the others next to Laurel also changed their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Harley said this, he was completely drawing a line between himself and Laurel. For the little princess of the Hart family to say such a thing, signifies that it would be difficult for the Blair family to survive in the corporation in the future. And if they were to maintain a relationship with Laurel, their own family might get implicated as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, their parents were also middle and senior executives at Hart Group.</span></p></div>
