        <h1>Chapter 1443</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss could not care about anything else now. He immediately picked Kyla Corbyn up and said to Nelson, "Follow me and we&rsquo;ll bring Mommy to the hospital. You don't want Mommy to be in such pain all the time, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one said nothing and just followed Martin Weiss closely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After getting into the car, Martin Weiss put Kyla Corbyn in the front passenger seat while Nelson got into the back seat without a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one's eyes that were similar to Kyla Corbyn's kept staring at her nervously through the gap between the seats. His little mouth kept saying, "Mommy, it's okay. It's okay. Once we reach the hospital, the doctors will treat you. You'll be okay right away!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With difficulty, Kyla Corbyn breathed a sigh of relief and squeezed out a smile for her son. She did not want the child to worry too much about her. "I'm fine... The pain will go away in a minute..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the mother and son, Martin Weiss felt a touch of bitterness in his heart. He stepped on the gas pedal and quickly drove toward the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Along the way, he watched her suffer in pain with clenched teeth to stop herself from crying out in pain, lest the child became more worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His mind suddenly went back to when she had accidentally fallen and her ankle got swollen. However, she did not say anything and did not tell him. He did not realize her injury until he sent her home and noticed that she was walking a little slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her ankle was already turning a little purple then, and there was a huge swollen bump.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why didn't you tell me you&rsquo;re hurt?" he had asked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She stuck out her tongue and said, "I didn't want you to worry! It's nothing. I'll just spray it with pain relief spray when I get home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That was how she was; she was a person who did not want others to worry about her. She would rather bear all the pain in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The traffic light happened to turn red when the car reached the intersection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss stopped the car, took a tissue, and leaned over to wipe the sweat off Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, her face was covered with sweat. Her forehead was covered with big beads of sweat, and he could see that she was in terrible pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The moment he touched her forehead with the tissue, she seemed to notice and trembled a little. Then she half-opened her eyes. The look in her eyes made Martin Weiss's heart tense suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyes were indifferent and distant. There was even... resistance. She seemed to be silently rejecting his touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss was ashamed for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, he woke up from his memories. She was no longer the innocent Kyla Corbyn who was willing to bear the pain for fear of his worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was only bearing the pain for Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss quickly wiped the sweat off Kyla Corbyn's face. The red light turned green, and he drove to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When they arrived at the hospital, Kyla Corbyn had already fainted from the pain. Martin Weiss held Kyla Corbyn in his arms and went to the emergency room while Nelson followed Martin Weiss closely. His young face was full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace received a phone call from Martin Weiss an hour later. On the phone, Martin Weiss seemed to sound tired. "Kyla is in hospital now. She fainted from the pain today. The doctor said if she doesn&rsquo;t get a transplant right away, even a transplant will be useless once it spreads completely."</p></div>
