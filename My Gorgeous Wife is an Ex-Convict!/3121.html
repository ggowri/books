        <h1>Chapter 3119</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm actually not afraid of what others say about me, but I'm afraid that Brian will be pointed at because of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you prefer to suffer yourself and make him suffer too? But are you sure he really wants what you think is good for him? What you consider 'good' may not necessarily be good for him, and in the future, you may also regret why you backed down. Valda, do you want to regret in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't end up like me, regretful but already too late," advised Amber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian and Simon returned, they saw Valda and Amber exchanging phone numbers and chatting about archaeology and comics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I have any questions about comics or archaeology in the future, I'll have to come to you," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, no problem," Amber replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them stood up and Valda looked at the things Brian and Simon brought back, which almost filled up her entire fridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian picked out some ingredients and said to the two of them, "Why don't you sit down for a while, I'll make lunch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then we'll have to trouble you, Mr. Hart," Amber said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little guy was not polite at all and pointed out what he wanted to eat to Brian, and even demanded that it not be too bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber laughed at her son's ignorance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">You know, it's really hard to eat food made by a prince, and many people can't even get a taste of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... can the food made by this prince really be delicious? Amber was a bit skeptical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda noticed Amber's suspicion and whispered, "Actually, Brian's cooking is quite delicious, don't worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber raised her eyebrows slightly and whispered, "It seems like you've had this before. But being able to eat a dish made by the Crown Prince is an extra blessing for today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, after Brian finished cooking and served the food on the table, the four of them had a satisfying meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Simon, the little friend, expressed his satisfaction with the meal and said that he would come to see Valda often in the future and also enjoy Brian's cooking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Brian's face immediately turned dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for Valda liking this child, he would have definitely thrown away this unpleasant kid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Simon and Amber left, Brian said, "That kid has quite a thick skin, just like his dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's alright, Simon is quite cute," said Valda. "When you guys went out earlier, I heard from Amber that Simon has come to Emerald City several times this year with George, and during the winter and summer breaks, Simon stays with Amber. At least George hasn't completely cut off their mother-son relationship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"George is probably still hoping to get back together with Amber," Brian said. He didn't really like George's personality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If you love someone, how could you not go see them even once, knowing that they have been suffering in a mental hospital for so many years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If George had just taken a glance at Amber during those years, he would have understood the kind of suffering she had gone through. Perhaps the situation wouldn't have turned out like it is now.</p></div>
