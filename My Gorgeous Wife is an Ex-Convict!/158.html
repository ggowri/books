        <h1>Chapter 157</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had heard Brian's name before.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, the Hart family was in charge of all kinds of businesses within the entertainment industry. Some even said that in the entertainment industry, whoever Brian wanted to be successful would become successful. If Brian wanted to suppress someone, then they would never be able to be successful for the rest of their lives.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">From this, one could tell how influential Brian was in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she had been dating Sean, she had once heard Sean mention him. Although the Stevens family was also considered rich and powerful in the city, compared to the aristocratic Hart family, the Stevens family was lacking.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean, of course, was not qualified to make friends with Brian.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for the other "hearsay", it had come from the mouths of those gossipy women in the Sanitation Service Center. It was said that Brian was indifferent and difficult to get along with, but he never was short of girlfriends.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had also made all of his girl friends famous, but once they broke up, he would be very decisive and brisk, even capable of being cold-blooded and ruthless.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, although he was the Crown Prince of the entertainment industry, he had never two-timed. When he was in a relationship with a woman, no matter how short the time was, during this period of time, he would only associate with that woman and would not be unfaithful.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was also the reason why he was not cursed on the Internet.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, they were adults, and they were all consenting. It could even be said that the women who had been in a relationship with him had all gained great benefits.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, there were also many women who dreamed of having a relationship with Brian. After all, they could gain a lot from it, and if they were doted on like a treasure by a handsome man, even if it was shortlived, it would be like a firework's moment of brilliance.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had never expected that it would be Brian who had barged into her rental apartment in the middle of the night. Furthermore, Brian had barged in just to retrieve an unremarkable silver bracelet.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed like this silver bracelet was very important to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alas, the Crown Prince and Emily broke up again. It seems that he's now dating a third-rate celebrity." Grace had been returning her tools while the girls in the Sanitation Service Center were chatting about Brian's gossip.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who's that third-rate celebrity? She actually defeated Emily?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She hasn't been exposed yet, that'll probably take a few more days. But it hasn't been too bad for Emily, if she hadn't been dating the Crown Prince, she wouldn't have become a first-rate star so easily! So thinking about it, she has also gained a lot."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I really hope that I can meet the Crown Prince one day. If he likes me, even if he only wants one night with me, I'll be willing."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In your dreams."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The young girls were laughing and gossiping as they browsed the online forums.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace did not know what they would think if they knew that she had met Brian in the middle of the night.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, what's wrong with you?" Claire said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Nothing." She came back to her senses, returned the tools, and changed out of her work uniform.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she put on her casual clothes, she looked at the scar on the palm of her right hand. This was from the night of Thanksgiving. In order to wake herself up, she had gripped some broken pieces of mirror. Fortunately, it had not injured the tendons of her hand.</p></div>
