        <h1>Chapter 96</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean left as if he was treading on air.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once the engagement ceremony started, Jason watched the exchange of the engagement rings on the stage and listened to the engagement speeches between Sean and Lily. A smile flashed across his face.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was estimated that tomorrow, the photos of Sean and Lily's engagement party would come out. Then it would be impossible for Grace and Sean to be together.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn&rsquo;t really think that Grace would ever welcome back Sean after what he&rsquo;d done or how he&rsquo;d deserted her, but he wasn&rsquo;t taking any chances.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the engagement ceremony ended, the hall was filled with people congratulating the glowing couple. However, Jason left the scene and walked out by himself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A silver Bentley waited outside. Terrence opened the door respectfully, and Jason hopped in.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, will you be going back to the rental apartment now?" Terrence asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah," Jason leaned against the back of the seat. Then, he slowly closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today, Brian Hart's presence surprised him. He hadn't thought that the woman that Brian had taken a fancy to would actually be Evelyn Cummins, Grace&rsquo;s half-sister.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In his opinion, there was nothing worthwhile about that woman at all. He really didn't know why Brian had taken a fancy to her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, this was someone else's business. Naturally, he wouldn't care too much about it, as long as Evelyn didn't try to cause trouble for Grace in the future. Otherwise... he would naturally make Evelyn suffer tens of thousands of times more.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, Director Atkinson called to ask why you left in advance. I think he is worried about whether you are annoyed or not," Terrence Klein said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just call him back and tell him that I am very happy tonight, but I am a little tired, so I have to go back early," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The car drove to the entrance of the community. Jason got out of the car, walked to the narrow door, took out the key, and opened the door.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the room, dim light was pouring down.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was knitting under the light. When she saw him coming back, she looked up at him with a sweet smile. "You're back. It's pretty cold outside, isn't it?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's fine," he said, looking at the wool in her hand. "Where did you get the wool?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I took apart some old sweaters to make a scarf and gloves for you. I have nothing to do at home these days, so I might as well find something to do."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was only then that he noticed that there were still a few labels on the table, and they were from a brand that he knew. "I recognize this brand. It's not cheap, is it? Why would you tear apart your clothes? Isn't it better for you to wear them?" He picked up the label and waved it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace said, "They aren't cheap, but the style of these sweaters is a little bit over the top. They are not suitable for me to wear now, so it's better to put them to good use."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That sweater was originally similar to the raincoat. Paired with narrow leggings, boots, and makeup, it would look very elegant. But now, she had no occasion to wear this kind of clothes, nor did she have a pair of narrow leggings and boots that could match her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was no chance to wear it at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I think this wool should be enough to make a scarf and gloves. Do you like the color?" she asked. The color of the wool was oat, which was neutral and suitable for both men and women.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason stared at the woman before him, and he marveled at her. Where everyone around him was consumed with taking, with what they could get out of him, all she did was <span style="font-style: italic;">give</span>.</p></div>
