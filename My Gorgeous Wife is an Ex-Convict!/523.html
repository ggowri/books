        <h1>Chapter 522</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned out to be the driver responsible for Jennifer Atkinson's accident, and Jason was now dating her. Two of the most unlikely people had become a couple. Who would have thought?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of something heavy hitting the ground was heard from behind Patrick. Patrick turned around and saw that Tasha Farmer's legs were so weak that she had once again fallen to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick gave Tasha a sympathetic look that spelled bad luck for the Farmer family; Tasha Farmer was likely to be expelled from their social circle soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Jason had never been a generous person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Elsie Jordan and Felicia Kemp felt a wave of fear in their hearts. This was especially true for the former. No matter how unwilling they were, hints of fear could be seen in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's attitude earlier meant that he had already been aware of Grace's imprisonment. Thus, what Tasha Farmer had just done was a death wish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not to mention... Jason even knelt in front of Grace like that&ndash;Which woman had ever been treated that way? Not even Jennifer Atkinson had been treated like that before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elsie Jordan could not hide her jealousy toward the scene she had witnessed. Nevertheless, at the same time, she was relieved that it was at least Tasha Farmer who had done it and not her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, Tasha Farmer seemed to have come to her senses as she looked at Elsie Jordan and Felicia Kemp eagerly. "You must help me, Elsie and Felicia. I... I did that to Grace for you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop spouting nonsense. We didn't ask you to do any of that," Felicia Kemp quickly denied her involvement in the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer's face turned red out of anxiousness. "How can you say that? I am only aware of Grace's imprisonment because you told me about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I merely remembered it and told you about it. I never asked you to mention it in front of so many people," Felicia Kemp said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer was fuming with anger. She turned to look at Elsie Jordan. "Elsie..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Among the three of them, Elsie Jordan was the most interested in Jason. If she had not wanted to please Elsie Jordan in hopes that the Lu family would help the Farmer family, she would not have been so aggressive toward Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elsie Jordan looked embarrassed as she said, "You were too impulsive this time, Tasha. Here, why don't you find a chance to apologize to Young Master Reed and Miss Cummins? Maybe there's still room to turn things around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Apologize?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Tasha Farmer had the urge to pop her veins. What Elsie Jordan was saying was equivalent to nothing; she was completely denying her involvement in the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three of them caused the current mess together, but she had to bear the consequences of it alone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer immediately jumped up to her feet and said, "It was you who didn't like the woman and dragged me over to play the bad cop. However, you&rsquo;re reluctant to admit it now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about?" Elsie Jordan immediately retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm speaking the truth. All right then. You and Felicia are using me as cannon fodder right now, aren't you?" Tasha Farmer said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the banquet, a dog-eat-dog competition began amongst the three women. Consequently, they made themselves the biggest joke of the event.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily sneered coldly. Apologize?! Hmph. If Jason accepted apologies that easily, her family's shopping mall would not have ended up being demolished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three women had involved Sean just to embarrass Grace. They had never considered the fact that Sean was currently her fiance, and they would only embarrass her by doing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was why she had not warned them that Jason was already aware of Grace's past. Sure enough, Tasha Farmer, the fool, could not wait to get into trouble in front of Jason while she became an onlooker.</p></div>
