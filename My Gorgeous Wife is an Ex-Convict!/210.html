        <h1>Chapter 209</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not?" he asked rhetorically. "Since I need to marry a woman in this life, does it make any difference whether I do it later or earlier? Jennifer Atkinson was quiet and obedient enough. A marriage with the Atkinson family could help the Reed family's development in shipping, so why not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was talking business, and Grace felt a faint pang of fear as she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he did not know love at all&hellip; Even marriage could be a business to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What would really matter to a person like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, now I think it&rsquo;ll be nice if I married a woman who is interesting to me." His eyes were fixed on her as he smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned away awkwardly. He spoke as if he was referring to something else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told herself not to think too much about it. He and she were people of two worlds. They would never be in the same boat. Soon, after giving him the gloves, surely he and she would never see each other again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I'll get you your gloves." She hurried around him to get the gloves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No hurry." He took her arm, slowly bent down, and looked at her. "Sis, you haven't answered my question from earlier. Are you trying to reverse the verdict?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she was! If she did not reverse the verdict, it meant that she would have to bear this crime and could not hold her head high for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about it?" she asked rhetorically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really want to reverse the verdict, then I can help you, Sis," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gasped. "You believe that I didn't drive under the influence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter to me whether you drove under the influence or not," he muttered. "It's just to get your drunk driving conviction out of the way. To reverse the verdict, I'll find the best lawyer I can to help you find a loophole in the case. That should get you out of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The gleam in her eyes was replaced by gloom. She understood what he meant. According to the innocent until proven guilty principle, she had to find some arguable statement before she could reverse the verdict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that did not mean she could be vindicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The innocence of the suspect would always be controversial even if the case was reversed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? Don't you like the idea?" He saw the change in her expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to get to the bottom of it. I want to know what went on during the accident. Why did the witnesses all say I was drunk? What happened to the physical evidence? What happened to the blood test that the police gave me after the accident, and why did it indicate I was drunk driving..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This series of questions had been buried deep in her heart over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did not get it straight, she would have to bear the crime forever. Even if the innocent until proven guilty principle found her innocent, in the hearts of others, she was still a criminal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face gradually darkened. A cold look seemed to appear in his deep, black eyes. "Is it that important for you to know the truth?"</p></div>
