        <h1>Chapter 745</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a simple word, but it meant that Lily was really blacklisted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she was mentally prepared, Grace was still shocked. After all, Lily was not an ordinary celebrity in the entertainment industry. She was the second daughter of the Atkinson family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason... Blacklisted her just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Staring at the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; on her phone, she was momentarily a little lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Grace sent another message, &lsquo;Will the Atkinson family turn against you?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to have his career affected because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the Atkinson family was also rich and powerful in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's response was concise. &lsquo;The Atkinson family won&rsquo;t dare to do anything.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those few words made her feel relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, Lily publicly announced that she would quit the entertainment industry and return to the Atkinson family to inherit the family business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The entire entertainment industry was immediately in turmoil at this sudden news!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Lily was the hottest celebrity right now and was even more likely to be named best actress with the movie that was about to be released this year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had not even been named best actress yet and she was going to quit?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Immediately, the news was the most searched topic online with hundreds of thousands of comments pouring in below.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw the news on her phone and found that everything was changing too fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day of the fair, Lily was still a famous female celebrity, but now, she was forced to quit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you looking at Lily's news?" Jason's voice unexpectedly rang in Grace's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just happened to stumble upon this. It's now the most searched topic online," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you don't want to forgive her, then I'll get back everything she made you lose," said Jason. He glanced at Lily's exit statement on the hot search list and smiled. "It's not so easy for Lily to quit glamorously."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does he mean?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Her phone rang suddenly. Grace took a look at it and saw that it was a call from her best friend, Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had just pressed the answer button when Lina's panicky voice sounded. "Grace, have you seen the news online? Lily wants to quit the entertainment industry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's so shameless. She was blacklisted, so she had to quit, yet she said she thinks her parents are getting older, so she has to go back and take over the family business," Lina said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hated Lily! She had treated her best friend cruelly. Those methods of torture were simply vicious! Who would have thought it was done by a woman who looked elegant and intellectual?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "How do you know that she was blacklisted, so she had to quit?" She had not told Lina that yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Someone broke the news, of course! I need to share it quickly to make it more popular, so more people know that this woman was blacklisted and forced to quit!" Lina's voice sounded eager. "By the way, is it Jason who blacklisted her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace did not hide it from her best friend and just confessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, what a nice husband you've chosen!" praised Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blushed immediately. 'Please! Jason isn't my husband yet! We haven't registered our marriage!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason was beside her right now and Grace was ashamed to say it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. We'll talk about it the next time we meet. I got to go!" Lina said and hung up the phone.</p></div>
