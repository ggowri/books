        <h1>Chapter 173</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason pulled Grace into the car and ordered, &ldquo;Get us to Royal Court.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Terrence acknowledged as he carefully observed the expression of the two people sitting behind via the rearview mirror.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace&rsquo;s head was lowered, thus he could not see her expression. However, Jason&rsquo;s mood seemed to be less moody compared to before he entered Grace&rsquo;s place. &lsquo;Hmm, I guess it&rsquo;s considered a good thing,&rsquo; Terrence thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Royal Court Restaurant was Emerald City&rsquo;s famous restaurant. It mainly served traditional palace court dishes, so prices here were exorbitant as well. The diners here solely comprised of the rich and famous. Regular people would not be able to afford a meal here.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the car came to a halt at the entrance of the Royal Court, Jason naturally held Grace&rsquo;s hand once they got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wanted to pull her hands out of his grip, but his hold on her was firm.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Sis, don&rsquo;t move. Otherwise, I can&rsquo;t guarantee what I&rsquo;ll do to bring you in,&rdquo; Jason casually said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was dumbfounded and stopped struggling.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He led her into the restaurant. The staff in the restaurant were very respectful and courteous toward Jason, but they would throw a few side-eyes and weird glances at Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace knew very well that her cheap clothes were a world of difference compared to the restaurant&rsquo;s classy interior.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Reed, you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; The restaurant manager greeted enthusiastically. &ldquo;The same private room?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before the manager could lead the way, Grace&rsquo;s vision caught sight of someone. She was stunned for a moment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&lsquo;That is... Maria !&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace&rsquo;s impression of Maria was that she was a spoiled princess. Her family owned a factory. When Grace bumped into her before this, Maria had spewed plenty of mockeries and even set her up to appear during a student reunion party.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, what made her shocked right now was that Maria was leaning on a short and chubby middle-aged man, looking so sweet and intimate as if they were lovers.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Based on Grace&rsquo;s understanding, Maria only had eyes for handsome-looking men. When they were still studying, Maria only dated the school jocks and openly despised fat boys.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet right now, she was...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As if feeling Grace&rsquo;s gaze on her, Maria turned to look over. When she saw that it was Grace, her expression changed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Grace, why are you here? Is this the kind of place that you can visit?&rdquo; Maria chided.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, she did not notice Jason who was standing next to Grace. All her attention was focused on Grace. She was urgently hoping that someone would chase Grace out!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, Grace was witnessing what a deplorable state Maria was in right now. If Grace let the word out about this...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That thought made Maria loathe Grace further, feeling that Grace was a bad omen for her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After bumping into Grace at the mall once, her car had unknowingly gotten smashed. After that, she had set Grace up to appear at the reunion party. Then, some things happened to her family. Their loan application got rejected by the bank, so their potential business collaborators decided to go back on their words and refused to work with them. Her family did not know who they had offended.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Subsequently, to ensure the survival of her family business, she now had to lower herself and gain favors with such a fatty. If drastic measures were needed, she would need to sell herself out!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She found it so nauseating each time she had to plaster a smile on to please this fatty!</p></div>
