        <h1>Chapter 2556</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked stunned as if she had heard an unbelievable story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My child? My child with George Gregory? Didn't my child die at birth? Why did George Gregory say Simon's mine? What the hell is going on here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's voice continued ringing. "It's true! I can show you the doctor's DNA test results if you don't believe me. Amber Mitchell, Simon is your child!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The special wedding hastily ended with George Gregory's intervention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell came to the hospital and looked at Simon lying inside the sterile room through the glass window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had donated blood to the little one in the hospital the last time, she did not see him. She saw the child through the glass window for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The child was asleep and wearing an oxygen mask. He had short black hair, and his eyes were closed. His features were delicate. His eyes and eyebrows looked a little like hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this... my child?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon's attending doctor also handed Amber Mitchell the little one's DNA test report. "Our hospital compared your blood with Simon's and found that you're mother and son. You can go to another authoritative institution for testing if you're still worried. But I think the result should be the same."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked at the report in her hand and was a little distracted, but she knew one thing. There should not be any problems with this report. After all, this hospital was a leading hospital in the industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What on earth happened?&rdquo; Amber Mitchell asked as she looked at George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know what happened. The doctor informed me when they unintentionally found out that you and Simon are mother and son. Louise Mitchell also admitted that Simon is your child. It's just that since we discovered the news so suddenly, we still need to investigate how she did it," replied George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell pressed her red lips together tightly. There was now little point in finding out how Louise Mitchell did it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it had happened, and Louise Mitchell was now behind bars for life. It did not matter much that she had committed one more &lsquo;sin&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor left, leaving George Gregory and Amber Mitchell alone in front of the sterile room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amby, I know I was wrong about what happened that year. Nothing had happened between you and Herman Moss. I misunderstood you. I lacked trust in you, and I wronged you. No matter how you want me to repay you, I'm willing to do it. But I hope you can believe that Simon is really our flesh and blood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never bowed down to others easily, but he was letting go of all his pride to beg for her forgiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was wrong. He was awfully wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell gazed silently at the man, whose face bore the traces of today's confrontation with the Moss family's security guards. She had never seen him like this before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want me to help Simon with his blood transfusion?" Amber Mitchell asked slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" A look of surprise flashed across George Gregory's face.</p></div>
