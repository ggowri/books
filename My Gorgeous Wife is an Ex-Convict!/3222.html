        <h1>Chapter 3220</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not old at all," Jason said, leaning down and placing his hands on either side of Grace's body. His handsome face drew closer to hers. "In my eyes, you're still very young."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You always know how to say things that make me happy," Grace murmured. "In a few years, I might start getting crow's feet around my eyes, followed by gray hair and wrinkles..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So I'm also growing old with you slowly," Jason said, as he leaned in and gently kissed Grace's cheek. "Grace, being able to grow old with you is the happiest thing for me. Thank you for not giving up on me and coming back with our child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace lifted her hands and wrapped them around Jason's neck. "So should I also thank you for still being willing to fall in love with me, even after being hypnotized to forget our memories?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then tonight, just thank me properly." He continued to kiss her eyebrows, eyes, and nose...finally landing on her lips. His voice was hoarse as he said, "If I'm not satisfied, you won't be able to leave..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though they were an old married couple, Grace couldn't resist his temptation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To her, he always had such an irresistible charm that sometimes just a word or a glance from him could make her heart skip a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He kissed her and she responded passionately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being able to grow old with him is also one of her happiest things, isn't it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if in the future, they have white hair and wrinkles, their love for each other will still remain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and Brian's honeymoon trip was pretty good overall, except for the occasional awkward moment of being recognized while walking down the street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Valda also bought a lot of anime-related merchandise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although many things can be bought online, there is still a different feeling when personally selecting and purchasing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the second to last day of their honeymoon, there happened to be a local anime convention. Visiting the convention was something Valda had planned in advance and was looking forward to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really going to the anime convention?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly, it would be a shame not to browse around since we have the time." said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A flicker of hesitation crossed Brian's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda shuddered at the thought of a certain possibility and asked, "Are you afraid that I'll go to the anime convention and it will bring back bad memories?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A rare expression of embarrassment appeared on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she knew she had guessed correctly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she was once attacked at an anime convention. And when she was being attacked by others, he received news of Grace's difficult childbirth and left without turning back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, it was precisely because of this that she broke up with him once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled and said, "Do you think I'm such a stingy person? The past is already behind me, and I know that you love me the most now. Your feelings for Grace are a thing of the past."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spoke and took his hand, "Alright, let's go. If we don't leave now, we'll probably get stuck in heavy traffic later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He followed her footsteps with a dazed expression, his phoenix eyes lowered and fixed on her hand holding his. It was she who had pulled him out of the abyss, and from now on... she would always be there to pull him along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Between them, there are still many years of life that they can spend together!</p></div>
