        <h1>Chapter 3082</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... just have a limp in my leg, I can still walk on my own. I... can walk by myself!" she said, not wanting to become more dependent on others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She now needs to be more independent and strong than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you can walk, I just want to make it easier for you," Brian explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But this kind of ease can't last forever. No one can carry another person forever, so people must learn to be independent, especially... someone like me," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not?" he argued. "I can carry you forever, Valda. If you don't want to be independent, it's okay to never be independent. I can be your support." He said urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt like there was a gap between them that kept growing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And her voice echoed in his ears - "But Brian, I want to be independent. I don't want to rely on you anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In an instant, he felt like an insurmountable chasm had opened up between them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stood at the bathroom door, feeling complicated. The sound of running water came from inside, Valda was taking a shower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before today, he thought that when she reappeared in front of him one day, he would be extremely happy and they would be happy together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But he didn't expect it to be like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved her, but she didn't believe it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought the biggest obstacle between them was his inability to fall in love with her, but now he knows that the biggest obstacle is her lack of belief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda hobbled out of the bathroom with her crutches, Brian approached her and said, "I'll have the bathroom renovated to make it more convenient for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need, I... don't plan on staying here for long," Valda said. "I still want to go back to my own apartment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned, "Don't you want to live with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda pursed her lips, "I still want to go back to my own apartment. That way, I'll feel more comfortable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you uncomfortable with me?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lowered her head gently and whispered softly, "We've been apart for a year, longer than we were together. I think I'll be more comfortable alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips almost straightened into a line. At this moment, every word she said was like a sharp sword, cutting into his heart and causing him pain. "Then who will take care of you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't need anyone to take care of me. I can take care of myself. I... I'm just lame, not incapable of taking care of myself!" A hint of embarrassment flashed across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't mean it that way, I'm just worried that it might be inconvenient for you to live alone," he explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, I've done it before... I came to Emerald City by hitchhiking alone and stayed in a hotel for several days, and everything was fine," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly froze, his dark eyes fixed on Valda. "You've been staying alone in the hotel for several days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda suddenly realized that she had let slip, and immediately bit her lip with her teeth, a look of confusion flashing across her face.</p></div>
