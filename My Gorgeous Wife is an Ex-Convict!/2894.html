        <h1>Chapter 2892</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, alright. Since Brian Hart has said so, let's not bother about how he does it. After all, you have handed over all the company's affairs to your son. Why bother about so much?" Madam Hart said, already considering Valda Theller as her future daughter-in-law. "When will Brian Hart bring Valda Theller back so that we can meet her? We have only heard of her but never met her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had always heard of Valda Theller but had never met her in person. Although their son had mentioned that he was dating her with the intention of marriage, they were still doubtful as they had not seen her yet. They thought it was just a passing fancy or there might be some other reason. However, now it seemed that their son was very serious about this woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Brian Hart's reaction was not as joyful as his mother's. He simply lowered his eyebrows and said, "Let's talk about it later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When later? When will that be?" Madam Hart asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, I have something to do. I have to go now. I just want to tell you that I will handle The Cross Family's affairs in my own way. No one can plead for them," Brian Hart said and left the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart and Madam Hart looked at each other in confusion. It seemed that Mr. Hart could not do anything about The Cross Family's affairs. After all, compared to The Cross Family's daughter, their future daughter-in-law was more important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the Hart Mansion, Brian Hart returned to his villa. Valda Theller had already gone to bed, and one of the two bodyguards was guarding the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can rest now," Brian Hart said to the bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, sir," the bodyguard stepped back, and Brian Hart pushed open the door and walked into the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was lying on the bed, sleeping quietly. The moonlight shone through the window, falling on her face, reflecting her peaceful face, which was so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, what do you want me to do so that you can stay with me again?" he murmured, but she was asleep and could not give him an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">-----</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller woke up, she freshened up and changed her clothes. However, when she walked out of the bedroom, she did not see any bodyguards at the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past few days, whenever she left the bedroom, the two bodyguards would always follow her closely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she walked downstairs, she saw Brian Hart waiting for her. "You're up, let's have breakfast together," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda Theller replied, looking around and still not seeing the bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you looking for?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are the two bodyguards? I haven't seen them," she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I gave them the day off today. I have nothing to do and wanted to spend some time alone with you," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller remained silent and followed Brian Hart to the dining table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The breakfast was already laid out on the table, consisting of some Chinese dishes, all of which were to her taste. "Try it," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller ate her breakfast quietly, even though she could feel his gaze on her from time to time, even when she lowered her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have any place you want to go today?" Brian Hart suddenly asked. "If you have somewhere you want to go, I can take you there..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I can't go alone, can I?" she asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face darkened slightly. "Is that all you want, to leave here?"</p></div>
