        <h1>Chapter 2424</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the woman listened to everyone talk, she became terrified. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, who the hell did I offend today? Could an ordinary man speak to the crown prince like that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outside the bar, Brian saw Martin Weiss, who had a bruised face, getting into the car alone. He said, &ldquo;Why don't you get in my car and let me take you back? I'm afraid it's inconvenient for you to drive when you're injured."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks." Martin Weiss refused. However, as soon as he opened the car door, he suddenly turned around and asked, "You... love Grace, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression changed slightly. "What's the matter? Since when did you become interested in other people's relationships, Chairman Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss continued by asking, "If you can hypnotize yourself to forget your feelings for her, would you be willing to do it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't understand what you mean, Chairman Weiss," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's a type of hypnosis that makes your feelings for someone fade without losing your memories about them. Those memories will just be like a movie in your mind, while you&rsquo;re an audience member. You won't feel anything toward the relationship. Would you opt for it?&rdquo; Martin Weiss asked. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled coldly. "I won&rsquo;t. If I lost those feelings, I don't know what I would have left."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you&rsquo;ll still want to keep your useless feelings even though you&rsquo;ll never get that person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think such feelings are useless?" Brian's eyes fell on Martin Weiss's bruised face, and his eyes seemed to sympathize with him. "It's sad if you don't even have such feelings. Having these feelings is painful, but at least they show me that I can love someone to that extent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was silent, not expecting such an answer from Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chairman Weiss, since you don't need me to send you back, then I&rsquo;ll say my goodbyes." Brian turned to leave after saying that. He got into another car not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's phone rang in the car. He answered it and frowned after listening for a while. "Keep a closer eye on them and figure out what's going on there, including the security system and how many people are inside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the person on the other end of the line answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian put away his phone and looked out the car window to see Martin Weiss getting into the car not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked thoughtfully at the car that gradually drove away. He did not expect Martin Weiss to ask such a thing. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Forget those feelings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Forget that I ever loved Grace?' The thought seemed to have never occurred to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His affection for Grace had continued throughout his childhood, youth, and adulthood... It would last throughout his entire life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian murmured, "Grace, I refuse to forget my feelings for you, but... I wish I could start over. If I could start over, I wouldn&rsquo;t let go of your hand. I'd ask for your name, where you lived, and then... we could grow up together. I&rsquo;d make sure you fall in love with me before you met Jason!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was never going to get that chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once you missed a chance... you could never get it back. Some regrets were destined to be lifelong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss drove back to the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Along the way, he could not help thinking about what Brian had said.</p></div>
