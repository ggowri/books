        <h1>Chapter 3228</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I just don't know if this attachment will turn into love in the future, and I wonder what Veronica Barlow thinks about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, these are all things for the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a brief chat among a few people, Brian and Jason went to the study to discuss some business matters, while Valda and Grace continued to chat in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The conversation shifted unknowingly to the topic of almost being kidnapped. Grace laughed and said, "During your honeymoon, you made it to the trending topics twice. I saw the videos others took, and Brian really cares about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, if he hadn't arranged for someone to follow me beforehand, I might have actually been kidnapped," Valda said. "Fortunately, everything's okay now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about the baby then?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Baby?" Grace was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard Mommy and Daddy say that when Auntie Valda and Uncle Brian came back from their honeymoon, they had a baby." Jasper said this while staring at Valda's belly with his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face turned slightly red, "Not so fast, we still need some more time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see," said Jasper with a disappointed look. "I was hoping to see Auntie Valda and Uncle Brian's baby soon. I have many toys that I could share with her. I would be a good big sister to her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a servant approached and said, "Madam, Miss Three, the Abbott family's people have arrived."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, ask them to wait in the side hall for a while. I'll go over there in a bit," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The servant left and Valda asked, "Do you have something to attend to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll be done soon. Please wait for me," Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper happily said, "Lawrence is here, Auntie Valda. Later, I'll ask him to play the piano for you. He plays really well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was surprised and looked at Grace, "Is this Lawrence the little boy that Jasper was looking for before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, that's him. He plays the piano well. I invited them over today to sign a contract. From now on, the Reed family will be responsible for all of Lawrence's educational expenses," Grace explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This education includes regular academic courses and all expenses related to piano lessons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace took Jasper to the sitting room while Mick stayed with Valda in the main hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Mick, who was almost 10 years old and resembled Jason the most among the triplets. However, their personalities were completely different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason gave people an unpredictable feeling, but Mick was mostly cold and seemed indifferent to everything. However, he was very protective when it came to family matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Valda and Mick looked at each other for a while before Valda spoke first, "Mick, do you have a girl you like in your class?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nowadays, children are much more open-minded than those in her generation. Some even have girlfriends or boyfriends in kindergarten, and in the first or second grade of elementary school, they can write love letters using pinyin and characters after learning just a few words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda became curious and wondered what Mick would be like if he had a crush on a girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was just destined to be disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick simply answered with two words, "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you not have a crush? Or are you just too shy to tell Auntie Valda?" Valda continued to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No." The little one's face showed no sign of embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have a favorite celebrity or cartoon character?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really none?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I like them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was left speechless by this question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them stared at each other with wide eyes, and Valda couldn't help but marvel at how different the triplets' personalities were.</p></div>
