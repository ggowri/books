        <h1>Chapter 849</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hugged Lina, her nose feeling sore. "Sure, your child is my child. Our child will have two mothers..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina. The only person who won't abandon me is probably you, Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How can I repay her for her kindness?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe even the rest of my life won&rsquo;t be enough time for me to repay her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the following days, Grace was busy collecting relevant information about the case, so she naturally came in contact with Chase Harper more frequently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had dinner a few times, but Grace always insisted on going Dutch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chase Harper must like you. I think he's pretty good. He seems upright." Lina came to see Grace once and met Chase Harper. They even talked for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt good about Chase Harper. 'He may look ordinary, but he's honest, reliable, and a little shy. He even blushes when he sees Grace.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such pure and innocent men were rare nowadays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's great, but he's not for me. He can find a better woman," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when she was having dinner with Hadwin on a date, Lina would think about her best friend and Chase Harper, wondering if the two were possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's on your mind?" Suddenly, a voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was surprised and immediately came back to her senses. Then, a beautiful face caught her eyes up close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, when did Hadwin get so close to me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; I'm thinking about..." she murmured, feeling her mind beginning to lose focus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was easy to be distracted by a face that looked like the face of a hero in a comic, and he was so close to her too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm?" His long eyebrows were slightly raised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Um... She felt a nosebleed coming, and she was tempted to tackle him at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man's good looks were also a test for a woman's willpower!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, what were you thinking about? Why were you so absorbed?" His thin lips opened lightly, that magnetic voice seducing her into temptation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm thinking about&hellip; Chase Harper&hellip;" she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chase Harper?" The name sounded like a man's name no matter what. Hadwin's brows became furrowed. "Why were you thinking about him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think he's quite pure and innocent. He keeps blushing too. I don't know if&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, don't forget whose girlfriend you are!" Hadwin's expression immediately sank. 'What is this woman thinking? She just confessed to liking me a few days ago, and now she's thinking about another man?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's beautiful eyes were glaring at Lina. In his mind, he had already stabbed the man named Chase Harper dozens of times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's scalp tingled. She knew that Hadwin had misunderstood, so she said quickly, "No, no, no! Of course, I remember that I'm your girlfriend. I'm just thinking of Chase Harper for Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean?" he asked suspiciously.</p></div>
