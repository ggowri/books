        <h1>Chapter 3354</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one, like finding a support, hugged his father's neck with a pitiful expression, wanting a hug, a rub, and some comfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the little one was very clever and knew that she absolutely couldn't tell on mommy. If she did, even if daddy loved her very much, he wouldn't be happy with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the little one was only three years old, she understood very clearly who was at the top of the food chain in the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, amidst the lively birthday party, the little one turned to Valda and said, "Mommy, I've been good today. You have to take me to the amusement park and keep your promise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, mommy promises you," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Recently, a new large amusement park had opened in Emerald City. When Tina came to visit, she talked about it and Harley's eyes lit up. She couldn't wait to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda said. "You have to be good today, and daddy and mommy will take you on the weekend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," the little one smiled brightly and nodded her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It must be said that the little one was really beautiful when she smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The party continued, and Harley played with Martin and Kyla's daughter Trista, the youngest member of the Reed family Jasmine, and Tina. Although the three children were older than Harley, they could still play together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eight-year-old Tina had become the leader of the group, while Jasmine, due to her weak health, looked shorter than Harley, who was three years younger. She seemed like a little protector.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few girls were playing in the garden behind the hotel, and Mick and Chandler were following along with them. The adults were also at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, there are bodyguards and security guards protecting the hotel surroundings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite this, half an hour later, a shocking fight broke out in the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's not an exaggeration to say that it was earth-shattering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both sides involved in the fight have quite a reputation. One side consists of several members from the Crypt families, who are also well-known like Hunter. These younger members heard that Chandler was going to attend the birthday party of a young princess in the entertainment industry, and wanted to join in on the fun, so they decided to come along and check it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Between the Crypt families, they hold significant power in secret, but they do not show themselves in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Generally, they don't socialize with families outside of their own. However, there is some interaction between the Crypt families.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The younger heirs of these families and Chandler, who are also acquainted, are considered part of the same social circle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler naturally brought them along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side of the fight, we have Harley leading the charge with Hart, Stephenson, Weiss, and Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The reason why Harley is considered the leader is because he was the first one to start the fight. Initially, it was just a playful scuffle between kids. However, as more and more children joined in, it became apparent that these kids came from influential backgrounds, turning the fight into a "world-shocking" battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in the next ten years or so, it will become a topic of conversation that those who participated in the birthday banquet will enjoy talking about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, because the major families were suppressing this matter at that time, it was not reported by the media.</p></div>
