        <h1>Chapter 1255</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice rang coldly in the car resolutely, not allowing a rejection!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a swollen face, Stella arrived at Brian's mansion to complain. Of course, the most important thing was to tell Brian that Grace had married Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was the only bit of good news ever since she was beaten to a pulp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This way, Brian&rsquo;s feelings for Grace would also end. However, at the thought of Grace marrying Jason and therefore becoming the young madam of a rich and powerful family, she was filled with jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unexpectedly, she was stopped by the security guards when she arrived at the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Hart isn&rsquo;t back yet," the security guard said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if Brian isn&rsquo;t back yet, I can go in and wait for him. He has never stopped me from going in before," Stella said arrogantly, venting the resentment she felt earlier on the bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That was before. Yesterday, Young Master Hart gave us an order saying you're no longer allowed to step foot in here again," the security guard replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was shocked. "No way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Lindsay, if you don't believe me, you can go to Young Master Hart for confirmation!" the security guard said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She came here to look for Brian because she could not find him! She was also turned away when she went to Brian's office, and no one answered when she called Brian's phone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella clenched her teeth and spoke arrogantly, "So what if I want to go in? Whoever dares to stop me can forget about keeping their job. I'll tell Brian about this later. Believe it or not, you're going to lose your job!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just as she was about to force her way in, she was stopped by the security guard. Then, the security actually called... the police!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella gaped at him. "How... dare you call the police?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you want to force your way in, we can only deal with it this way!" the security guard said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella clenched her teeth, her swollen face looking even more hideous now. "Just wait and see. I'm going to get rid of all of you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While she trash-talked, she did not notice that someone not far away was snapping their camera at her in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That night, one of the trending searches was &lsquo;Was the crown prince's woman beaten?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sight of Stella arrogantly throwing a tantrum at the gate of Brian's mansion with a swollen face was utterly hideous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a ton of speculation in the comments below. There was also speculation that the crown prince had beaten Stella himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's face became contorted as she looked at the trending news about her. Such a photo was a stain on her life, and she feared she would be laughed at even if she became the best actress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly called her manager and asked him to take the post down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she immediately got her manager's reply. "We can't remove it. Several parties are making it viral!"</p></div>
