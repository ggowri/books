        <h1>Chapter 2369</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them sat down. While they had dinner, Kyla could not help but ask, "Umm... Is my novel with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Novel? You mean &lsquo;Loving You For The Rest Of My Life&rsquo;?" Asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she replied. 'Has he even memorized the title?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "I have it. But I'm a little surprised that you&rsquo;re fond of such books even now. I recall you enjoying reading such books when we were dating."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was speechless. Likewise, she did not expect him to take her book. "It's only to pass the time. After all, I have to stay away from some electronics now that I&rsquo;m pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you enjoy the novel?" he asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright," she said. Of course, a novel that was a bestseller and published in hard copies was good. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss seemingly spoke nonchalantly, "But don't you think the two people in the book are wasting their time with each other? She spent 20 years with a man in a coma, wasting 20 years of her youth. Even though he woke up in the end, they were both already old. It would&rsquo;ve been more practical for her to find a new relationship rather than waste her time on someone in a vegetative state, no?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at the man in front of her. "Feelings are never commodities. It doesn't matter whether it's practical. She willingly stayed by his side because she loves him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Willingly? I think the woman just felt guilty! She made him fall into a vegetative state, so she was haunted by the guilt," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not guilt. If it's just guilt, how could she gently wipe his body, apply the medicine for him, and do the dirtiest and most tiring work by herself every day for 20 years? If it's just guilt, wouldn't it be more convenient for her to just find a nurse?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "The author probably has the same mindset as you, so they made it out to be love. Isn't it silly to bet the rest of your life on whether a person will wake up or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really think it's silly?" Kyla asked as she stared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t this man say he would spend the rest of his life betting on a chance&mdash;a chance for me to forgive him? Even though I repeatedly told him that I wouldn&rsquo;t fall for him again, he insisted on taking a chance.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, she thought he was only being regretful and feeling guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she later learned that he loved her and was willing to love her with his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... he could no longer love her like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't it silly?" he retorted with a look of amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes darkened. "Perhaps... it is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I brought the book back. I'll return it to you later, but you should read fewer such books while you're pregnant. I'll buy you some books suitable for antenatal training."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said as he lowered his head and continued eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Martin Weiss. After a long while, she said, "Do you no longer believe in love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just blurted out the words. She had no idea why she asked that either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's not a question you should ask." He looked up at her coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart instantly trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that she had ruined some things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace called to inform Kyla that Jacqueline Bowman's trial was set to be held three days later.</p></div>
