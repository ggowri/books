        <h1>Chapter 869</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The fingerprints on the steering wheel and the surveillance video of the two of them getting into the car showed that Pansy Dittman was driving in the driver's seat while Elise Dean was in the passenger seat," said Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. That's true, but... the timing doesn't match," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The timing?" Lawyer Carter narrowed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace continued saying, "I found a taxi this morning and tried it out. From where they got into the car, it would take about 15 minutes to drive to the scene of the accident at the speed we got from the surveillance. The witness, Chase Harper, called the police immediately after the car crash, but the time they started the car to when the car crash happened took 23 minutes! At any rate, eight minutes is too great a difference."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter's eyes lit up. It was a detail he had not noticed before. An eight-minute delay was indeed a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As far as we know from the surveillance, they were only monitored within the first 10 minutes after driving. There was no footage after that, so both of them probably changed seats for some reason during that time," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter thought about it and said, "It's not out of the question."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'd like to see Elise Dean and sound her out. Maybe I can find something," said Grace. The actress Elise Dean was only used as a witness in the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the traffic case was closed, even if there were some doubts about the case, these doubts alone might not lead the police to reopen the investigation&mdash;unless more evidence was found!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter pondered for a moment before saying, "Alright, but watch your words so you don't make her suspicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, got it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not hard to find Elise Dean who was currently filming in Emerald City's film studio. Grace approached Elise Dean to explain that she was the paralegal representing the victim's parents and wanted to ask more questions about the case. When she heard that, the actress' delicate face was full of impatience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Pansy Dittman is no longer my assistant. She&rsquo;s the one who caused the accident. I can't help it that she transferred her assets and refuses to pay compensation. I've already donated 100,000 dollars to the injured patient out of kindness. Isn't that enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I just want to get a clearer picture of what happened. After all, Miss Dean, you're also a witness. I'm sure you sympathize with the victim, right? You hope that the victim gets justice too, don't you?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean was embarrassed to refuse since Grace had put it that way. After all, an actress like her was naturally aware of her reputation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did not cooperate now and the media found out about it later, she would not be able to fix her damaged reputation no matter how much money she put in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just ask me anything you wanna know. You'd better hurry, though. It's my turn to film soon," said Elise Dean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure!" Grace answered and began to ask questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After about 15 minutes, Elise Dean started filming again. Grace walked alone with her head down as she headed toward the exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean's answer just now was perfect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She deliberately started by asking Elise Dean what she had already said in her testimony. Then, she asked her if there was anything that distracted Pansy Dittman when she was driving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean replied that a cat ran out and surprised Pansy Dittman. After a while, she tried to drive again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the place where Elise Dean said the cat appeared, it was along the stretch of road with no surveillance. In other words, whether it was true depended on what she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Recalling the moment Elise Dean said these words, Grace had a feeling that Elise Dean deliberately prepared this speech.</p></div>
