        <h1>Chapter 4313 Saving a Life</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley lowered her head slightly because even though she was engaged to Lornell, she was still considered an outsider to the Quentin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't actually know much about the Quentin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked into the campus and headed towards the dormitory, suddenly a noise came from a dark corner. Then, Harley heard someone say, "If you dare to seduce my woman, believe me, I'll destroy you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I didn't..." a weak voice spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another sound of fists hitting: "Didn't? Then why does my woman keep staring at you all the time? Do you think you're so great just because you're good-looking? Well, today I'll make your face more interesting and see if any woman still likes your face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley listened, furrowing her brows. She was about to step forward, but her friend Karen held her back. "Don't go, the person speaking is a notorious troublemaker in school. It's not worth getting involved with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite furrowing her brows, Harley shook off her friend's hand and walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What caught her eye was a skinny teenager, being pinned against the wall by another boy. The boy pinning him down held a knife in his hand, gesturing menacingly in front of the teenager's face as if he was about to slash it harshly at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the teenager didn't seem as afraid as Harley had imagined. Rather than being scared, it seemed more like resignation. He didn't even struggle, as if he was simply waiting for the cruel fate to descend upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Harley shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, all the people at the scene turned their gaze towards her, including the boy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy holding the dagger looked at Harley and his eyes flickered. "Oh, who do we have here? It's the Hart family's little miss. What's the matter? Are you here to play the damsel in distress?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley glanced at the beaten boy. He now had a completely battered and bruised appearance, and there was nothing remotely beautiful about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if I am?" Harley retorted. "If you release him, we can talk things out. But there's no need for this kind of approach. This is a school, and if he really got hurt, you won't be graduating either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy's face turned unpleasant. Harley was quite famous in the school, after all. With the support of the Hart family, she was recognized as the princess of the entertainment industry. Many people wanted to flatter and please her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if we can get the resources of the Hart family, then in the entertainment industry, even if we can't become top-tier stars, we'll still have a good chance of making it to the A-list!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Harley already having a fianc&eacute;, there would probably be a line of people chasing after her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Consider yourself lucky!" The guy who got punched spat at the boy and left unwillingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley walked up to the boy, looking at his face full of wounds, and noticed that he was looking at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although one of his eyes was swollen shut from the punch, the other eye that was uninjured was surprisingly beautiful, with long eyelashes and deep black irises, giving off a hint of allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this face can reduce swelling, it might actually look quite attractive. After all, it has a pair of captivating eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can help you once, but I can't help you every time. If you haven't done anything wrong and the other party is just picking on you, then you need to find a way to help yourself instead of resigning to your fate!" Harley spoke up.</span></p></div>
