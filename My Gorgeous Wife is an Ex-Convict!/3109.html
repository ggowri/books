        <h1>Chapter 3107</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the parking lot, Camille volunteered and said, "I'll drive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Brian replied, handing the car keys to Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille is driving the car while Brian is holding Valda in the back seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda remained silent, her face still buried in Brian's embrace. Her hands unconsciously clutched onto her dress, her teeth gritted as she tried to suppress the urge to scream in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because if she shows a lot of pain, it will only make Brian and Camille more worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does it hurt? If it hurts, it's okay to shout out," Brian said with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her slender body stiffened in his embrace, and after a while, she said, "It's okay...not that painful..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the more she acted this way, the more it hurt him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to see her face, but every time he moved, she moved with him, never letting him see her current expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian had to give up, but his heart felt even more uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the car arrived at the hospital entrance, Brian quickly got out of the car and carried Valda in his arms, rushing towards the emergency room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Camille went to the parking lot to park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Here in the emergency room, Brian had already instructed his subordinates to contact the hospital beforehand while they were in the car. Therefore, there is already a doctor waiting for us now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctors rushed over when they saw Brian carrying Valda and quickly placed her on a stretcher bed for an urgent examination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only at this moment did Brian finally see Valda's face clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her forehead was already wet, with many strands of hair sticking to her forehead and cheeks due to sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face was pale, and she had a pained expression. Her teeth were tightly biting her lower lip to prevent herself from crying out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian saw Valda like this, he felt his heart twist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the woman he tried so hard to protect, but he ended up turning her from a healthy person into what she is now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there any way to relieve her pain now? Like anesthesia or something?" Brian asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At present, due to the examination, if anesthesia or painkillers are used, it will actually be difficult to identify the source of her pain. Only after a thorough examination and diagnosis can appropriate painkillers be prescribed," explained the doctor on the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Brian could only watch helplessly as Valda suffered in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the first time, he regretted not studying medicine. If he had studied medicine, he would have had a better understanding of her pain and symptoms, and perhaps could have found better ways to alleviate her pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he can now dominate the entertainment industry, he feels so powerless in the face of her pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the initial examination, Valda was pushed to take an X-ray.</p></div>
