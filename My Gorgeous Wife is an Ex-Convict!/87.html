        <h1>Chapter 86</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Zoe didn&rsquo;t stop.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their parents watched her as she launched into a rant about how cheap Grace was, how shameless she was to set foot in the designer store, and a litany of other grievances that sounded hollow at best. And of course she latched onto him writing Grace a check for millions.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He hoped she cashed it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a sizable chunk of money and it could get her back on her feet.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And it was probably the only gesture standing between him and Jason Reed breaking down the door to their house right now.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mom!!!&rdquo; Zoe railed. &ldquo;He slapped me! In public!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean knew the real root of the problem was that Zoe had taken a hit socially when Grace hadthe accident&mdash;they all did. And him hitting her&hellip; if that went viral, he&rsquo;d all but kill his sister&rsquo;s social life again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I warned you,&rdquo; Sean began.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Zoe went apeshit as soon as he said it, and he opted not to bother trying to reason with her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was unreasonable even on her best days.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Would Grace accept the money? he wondered again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That check was enough that it could be considered compensation for her injuries.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not all of her injuries&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That niggling voice came from the back of his psyche. Where at the oddest times he recalled the prison and everything that had befallen Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Punishments he himself had seen to.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn&rsquo;t feel guilty about things per say, but he did think that he could have left things alone, not encouraged Lily so much nor tried so hard to stay in the Reed Family&rsquo;s good graces.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But that was all in the past.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not after today&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;&hellip;it might not be a lot of money to us,&rdquo; Zoe went on. &ldquo;But that golddiggin bitch doesn&rsquo;t deserve a penny!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sean, surely Zoe is mistaken. You wouldn&rsquo;t make such a mistake,&rdquo; Mrs. Stevens stared at her son anxiously.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You should ask Zoe what she did," Sean replied instead. "She told Grace to choose a dress from the shop to buy for her and Grace chose a couture dress. I was just cleaning up Zoe&rsquo;s mess."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Just because she chose it, you had to give it to her?!" Zoe retorted insolently. "Brother, why didn't you say that you still have feelings for Grace?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm saving your life!" Sean shouted. He was itching to slap his sister again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh please.&rdquo; Zoe&rsquo;s hands shot to her hips. &ldquo;What is Grace, the sanitation worker, going to do to me? Do you even hear yourself right now?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's right. Sean, you've gone too far, hitting your sister because of Grace. That woman is a curse. If it weren't for her, would our family have to be so wary of the Reed Family and afraid of offending them?" Of course his mom defended his sister. She always was her favorite.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mom, it's not what you think it is..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then what else could it be?" his mom replied. "That Grace is still unwilling to give up. You're already getting married and she's still inserting herself in your life? Trying to take your money!? How dare she!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His mom&rsquo;s eyes were glowing with rage and he watched as she worked herself into a full-blown meltdown. Sean stood up abruptly. "Mom, why don't you ask what Zoe did to Grace later? She intentionally tripped Grace and caused her to fall down the escalator!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So what?" Madam Stevens said dismissively. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the worst that could&rsquo;ve happened? She got hurt? Big deal. The Stevens Family can compensate for any amount of medical fees. Did you really have to hit your sister over something like this?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean took a deep breath. He reminded himself that he had information that his family did not. If Grace wasn&rsquo;t supported by Jason Reed, would he be agonizing over these things and going out of his way to help Grace? Probably not.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he couldn&rsquo;t tell his family the truth, not without risking Jason Reed&rsquo;s wrath&mdash;the one thing all of his efforts were intended to avoid.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We are better than this,&rdquo; Sean said neutrally. &ldquo;Should a video surface of Zoe intentionally tripping a woman down a flight of stairs, we will create a PR nightmare for Stevens Corporation!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh, please. Do you think I&rsquo;m stupid? I already paid to have the mall surveillance deleted.&rdquo; Zoe huffed. &ldquo;And what about the situation you&rsquo;re creating with Lily?&rdquo; Zoe shot back.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A fair point. &ldquo;You just let me worry about my fiancee.&rdquo; Sean turned back to his parents. &ldquo;Anyway, Mom, Dad, look after Zoe. Don't let her create any trouble..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, his father&rsquo;s phone rang suddenly. Dad answered the call and after listening for a few moments, his face immediately turned pale.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Dad, what happened?" Sean asked quietly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The bank has suddenly closed on our loans," his father said in a shaky voice.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How could this be? Didn't the bank say that there wasn't a problem before? Why don't you call Bank Manager Chasetao?" his mom hastily suggested.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's no use. Bank Manager Chasetao was the one who called me," his father replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He needed to think. This situation called for damage control.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He&rsquo;d already tried to make good on his sister&rsquo;s actions, but clearly it was not perceived that way. Maybe the slight would&rsquo;ve gone unchecked but tripping her down the escalator&hellip; Zoe had gone too far.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And, really, was his sister&mdash;and mother&mdash;so stupid to think that Grace couldn&rsquo;t have died? She could have broken her neck or bled internally.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean&rsquo;s whole body broke into a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Stopping the loans would impact the operating revenue and diminish the flow of funds for Stevens Group. Was this the backlash?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Or was Jason just beginning?</p></div>
