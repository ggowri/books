        <h1>Chapter 2910</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he heard the word "disgust", a hint of pain flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Life may have many missed opportunities, and between you and me, it was also a missed opportunity. In fact, when you hurt me, I once fantasized that one day you would stand in front of me and say that you regretted it, that you wouldn't hurt me again, that you loved me. At that time, I also thought that if you really said that to me, then I would forgive you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And you..." His face showed a sense of urgency.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused and continued, "But later, as other classmates in school subjected me to various forms of campus violence, and you just stood by and watched, gradually, I no longer had this kind of fantasy. All my feelings for you were erased at that time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice calmly recounted her own emotional journey, the things that had once hurt her deeply. Now, speaking of them again, she could do so calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She didn't know if the past between her and Brian Hart could also gradually become calm with the passage of time, and no longer make her feel so uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, I think the reason we missed each other is that I liked you too early, and you loved me too late. So even though you've said so much these past few days, I don't feel anything in my heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no waves in her heart, not even a desire to be with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Too early...and too late?" Raymond Bowman murmured, his arms that were supposed to embrace her now hanging weakly at his sides. "Valda Theller, is there really no possibility at all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." She answered him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because you love Brian Hart?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her lips. "Yes, I love him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But things aren't good between you and him, are they? Did you break up? So just now, there was no intersection between you two?" Raymond Bowman guessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said calmly, "As I said, I don't want to talk about my affairs with you, and please don't ask me again. How things are between me and him is our business. Between you and me, it's already over, or you could say it never really began."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she finished speaking, she walked past Raymond Bowman and headed towards the banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman stood in place with a desolate expression on his face. After a while, he took a step forward and walked towards the banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But as soon as he returned to the banquet hall, he saw Barbara Schuman walking towards Valda Theller's table, holding up a glass as if she was going to toast Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman frowned slightly. He had no good feelings towards Barbara Schuman now, but he was also worried that she might harm Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Immediately, Raymond Bowman walked up and heard Barbara Schuman say to Valda Theller, "Valda Theller, we're all old classmates. You don't even want to drink a toast with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think Miss Schuman and I are close enough to drink together," Valda Theller said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why say that?" Barbara Schuman smiled slightly. The corner of her eye caught sight of Raymond Bowman walking over, and the smile on her face became even more obvious. "Even if you liked Raymond Bowman back then, and Raymond Bowman liked me, I'm not with him now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned her head and said to Raymond Bowman, "Raymond, look, Valda Theller still likes you now, that's why she doesn't want to reconcile with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Barbara Schuman spoke, the people around them perked up their ears, curious to hear the gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Barbara Schuman's words made Raymond Bowman feel embarrassed. "Barbara Schuman, that's enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why is it enough? I really want to make peace with Valda Theller!" Barbara Schuman said, "Valda Theller, let me tell you a secret. Actually, Raymond Bowman likes you now too. He even told me that he wants to be with you. It's a pity that you didn't get together back then because of me. Why don't you get back together now? After all, you both liked each other, didn't you?"</p></div>
