        <h1>Chapter 2006</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Lina went to Kyla's store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Business was rather slow around two o&rsquo;clock. Kyla was happy to see Lina look so happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Good times were finally starting for Lina after her hard times were over. She would not end up the same as her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Things will get busy when your baby is born. Now that you and Hadwin Stephenson are back together, where are you going to settle down when you get married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mainly Emerald City, I guess. Hadwin said my parents are used to living in Emerald City, so they probably won't get used to J City if we made them move there. If I separate from my parents, I'd be worried about them missing me. So he said Stephenson Group will set up another headquarters here in Emerald City when the time comes," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Hadwin Stephenson really cares about you. You and Grace are doing well. I'm happy for you two."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, you&rsquo;re always happy for us. Have you ever thought of yourself?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Me?" Kyla paused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You've always said that you're going to stay with Nelson and this store. Your store is doing okay now, but living costs will only increase as Nelson grows older. Aunt is getting old too. The medical expenses and whatnots will be expensive if she gets sick," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's eyes dimmed. She had thought about what Lina said, but there was so little she could do. The quiet life she had now was already a luxury to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, have you thought of doing any other businesses? For example, you can open a restaurant or something. Lina and I can invest in it. You'll be in charge of managing it. You'll be a shareholder with your skills. If business is good, we'll make it a chain. It's better than opening a store."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla knew that her best friends were trying to help her, but she had never liked taking advantage of others. Her friends would be giving her money for free if she went with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Watching Kyla's indecisiveness, Grace said, "Kyla, you may think about it. There's no need to answer us right away. There's no rush to open a restaurant anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you. I'll think about it." Kyla was speaking when her cell phone suddenly rang, so she answered it. After listening for a while, her expression instantly changed and she quickly said, "Okay, got it. I'll come over right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that, she hurriedly got up and said to Grace and Lina, "Sorry, I can't entertain you anymore. I have to go to the school now. Something happened to Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson? What happened to him?" Grace and Lina asked hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They said he beat up his classmates at school. His class teacher asked me to go over now." Kyla woke Mrs. Corbyn, who was taking a nap inside, to take care of the store. Then, she packed up her things and went to the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Lina followed her to the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When they arrived at the discipline office, they saw that Nelson Corbyn's uniform zipper was torn and one sleeve was ripped. Dirt covered his body in many places, his face was red and swollen, and his lips were injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla quickly ran forward as she looked at her son in distress. "What happened? How did you get into a fight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Nelson said nothing. He only lowered his head. He seemed anxious as the hands by his sides were clutching the dirty hem of his shirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla paused a little. "Nelson, what's wrong? Tell me what happened."</p></div>
