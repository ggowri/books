        <h1>Chapter 2820</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a minor injury. Don't worry," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his words did not put Valda Theller at ease. "What about your body? Are there any other injuries?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think so," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller worriedly said, "You don't think so? Didn't you check yourself when you showered? No, let's check again in case we missed any injury."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Check? How are you going to check?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have to take off your bathrobe, of course. Let me see if you have..." She fell silent in the middle of the sentence, her face already red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I talking about? I actually asked him to take off his bathrobe. I don't think he's wearing anything under his bathrobe...' With that in mind, she could not help glancing at his chest that was vaguely obscured by his bathrobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want me to take off my bathrobe?&rdquo; Compared to Valda Theller who was blushing, Brian was calm as if Valda Theller had just said something common.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller instantly had no idea whether to answer yes or no.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the doorbell of the hotel room rang. Valda Theller hurriedly got up and said, "I... I'll get it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hotel staff delivered the medicine Valda Theller needed at the door. When she walked back to Brian with the medicine, she blushed and said, "Let... Let me take care of that cut on your arm first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said and put the medicine on the coffee table. She rolled up his bathrobe sleeve before disinfecting the wound with iodine solution. Then, she cautiously applied ointment for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she still looked at him anxiously after applying the ointment. After all, he had fallen on his whole back, hitting the stones at the bottom of the stream. She wondered if his back was injured...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want me to take off my bathrobe?" Brian's voice rang in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated and finally took a deep breath before saying, "Okay, take it off!" She spoke as if she had made a resolute decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Surprise flickered in Brian's eyes. Then, he slightly loosened the strap of his bathrobe and pulled off the collar. The upper part of the bathrobe slid down his body to his waist, and she instantly saw his chest and back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller instantly felt her heart beating violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It thumped as if it was about to jump out of her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His upper body was bare in the light. His wet hair was a little messy, toning down his usual indifference and adding some nonchalance. He had an angular face, delicate features, and a beautiful outline...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything about him was like a work of art&mdash;flawless and stunning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was in a trance until Brian's voice rang again. "What's the matter? Are you hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She came to her senses and calmed down. She went around behind him and looked at his back. Fortunately, there were no new wounds or scratches on his smooth skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No," she muttered as she gulped. She suddenly understood why the female characters in some comics and films could not help having their way with men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had the same urge now.</p></div>
