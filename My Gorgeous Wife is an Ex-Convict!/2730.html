        <h1>Chapter 2728</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were sounds of gasps all around, and Valda Theller was slightly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was currently in Brian's arms as she heard Brian's voice mutter, "Sorry, I was late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just a short sentence, but it somehow made Valda Theller's eyes water instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she looked brave when facing Phoebe Cross and the socialites, only she knew how nervous she was earlier. She even had the feeling as though she was going to war. She was afraid they would destroy her if she were not careful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she heard Brian say that short sentence while he held her in his arms, her nervousness finally eased a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned and stared coldly at Phoebe Cross and the rest. "Phoebe Cross, do you have any advice for my girlfriend?" His cold voice sounded faintly furious, making Phoebe Cross panic instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, it was... It was just a misunderstanding. I... I was just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A misunderstanding?" Brian snapped his fingers coldly and let the waiter with the wine come to him. Then, he picked up a glass of red wine from their tray and shoved it into Phoebe Cross's hands. "Are you stupid, or am I stupid?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's expression changed. 'Is Brian... asking me to spill it onto myself?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she would be embarrassed if she did so in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's eyes shifted expectantly to Patrick who was standing beside Brian. She thought he would plead for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick got the hint. After a moment's hesitation, he cleared his throat and said, "Brian, why don't you let Phoebe apologize to Valda? And this matter&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before Patrick finished speaking, Brian interrupted him, "Valda is my girlfriend. Do you think she was spilling the drink on Valda or the Hart family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick said nothing as soon as he said that. Since Brian brought up the Hart family, it meant Brian was standing up for Valda Theller rather than just putting on a show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Patrick's eyes could not help darkening. It seemed that Brian was more serious about Valda Theller than he imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross clenched her teeth and glared at Valda Theller, whom Brian held in his arms. After a while, she finally said, "Miss Theller, it was my fault just now. I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she spilled the glass of red wine on her gown, put it down, and turned around to walk away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was embarrassed to stay at the banquet in this state and wished she could leave as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She now hated Valda Theller even more. She felt that all the humiliation she suffered today was due to Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Phoebe Cross left, Valda Theller hurriedly asked Brian, "There's wine all over your suit. Let me help you wipe it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't bother," Brian said, taking off his suit and casually hanging it on his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wore a suit vest inside. Pairing it with the white shirt and dark-colored tie, he looked casually elegant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it okay what you... did to her?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're my girlfriend. Of course, I'm going to get payback after she treated you like that. Alright, I'll introduce you to some people. Maybe it&rsquo;ll help you in your future development," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they broke up in the future, he wanted her to have a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed like the first time he had thought about his girlfriend's future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian mostly introduced Valda Theller to leaders of cultural enterprises and producers.</p></div>
