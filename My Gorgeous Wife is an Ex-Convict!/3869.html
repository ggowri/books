        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever she missed him, she would play this piano and imagine that they were playing together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you're leaving Emerald City, we probably won't have any more intersections in the future. So, how about playing a piece with me now?" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Play together?" Lawrence sneered, "Jasper, do you want to play with me to say goodbye to the past?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," she said, "because I want to completely erase you from my heart, so that I won't feel guilty or regretful about you in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence looked at her steadily. Her words made him feel empty, followed by more unwillingness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was unwilling to let her easily say that she had no feelings for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, since you want to play a piece with me, let's do it," Lawrence said. "What piece do you want to play?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since their relationship started with Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige, it would also end with this piece.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's body trembled slightly, his thin lips tightly pursed into a line. After a moment, he suddenly smiled, "Okay, let's play Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two sat down, their hands resting on the black and white keys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper felt bitter in her heart. She had once hoped for this scene so much, but now it was so painful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know what their future held, but she was certain that they could never go back to the way things were before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's begin," Jasper took a deep breath and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fingers pressed down on the keys and the sound of the piano filled the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige... This piece of music held a special meaning for the two of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were both very familiar with it, and even though they hadn't practiced together before, their playing was perfectly in sync.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if they had rehearsed it countless times in their minds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper immersed himself in the music, using it as a way to express all the emotions he had for her and their past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the piece came to an end, Jasper was still lost in the music until Lawrence's voice broke through, "Why are you crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper touched his cheek and realized he had tears on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because from now on, I won't cry for you anymore," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's eyes darkened, "Do you really think that after this piece, we're completely over?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He reached out and wiped away her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned away, avoiding his touch, but his fingertips still brushed against her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, this time your tears are for me, but it won't be the last time. I'm leaving Emerald City, but that doesn't mean I won't come back! Someday, I'll return to Emerald City and what's between us isn't over yet!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wiped away her tears and looked at him, "Are you still seeking revenge? Are you going to continue to involve innocent people?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So as long as they're not innocent, you can seek revenge?" he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, she understood that the "not innocent" person he referred to was her.</p></div>
