        <h1>Chapter 4264 May You Have a Safe and Happy Life</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the divorce agreement handed to her and suddenly felt a sense of bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this really what she wanted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it really okay to divorce Chandler like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So according to the contract, when I am in good health and the doctor considers me fit for pregnancy, we will go to the hospital for artificial insemination..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, he interrupted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned. She never expected Chandler to say that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you said..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, what you heard that day was only part of it. Breaking the curse doesn't necessarily require the umbilical cord blood and placenta of a child. There are other ways, albeit more difficult. But as you said, the birth of a child should not be solely to save someone's life. It should be because two people love each other. I don't want this child to resent me for the reason of its birth, and I don't want you to have this child for such a reason!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> there are other methods?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Tina didn't know whether to feel relieved or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was a hint of disappointment in her heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the bond between them had diminished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh my God, Tina, what are you thinking! She shouted at herself in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't it better this way? Since she chose to divorce him, their bond should be as little as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you put it that way, then I won't say anything," Tina said, getting up to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina!" Chandler also stood up. "Wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look at him. "Is there something else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I hug you again?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment, and he quickly added, "Just a hug. I won't bother you anymore. Even if I want to visit our daughter, if you don't want to see me, I can have someone bring Quinn over and then send her back to you at the agreed time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was almost humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt her heart become heavy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If possible, she didn't want him to speak to her in such a humble tone. It only made her feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" she agreed and opened her arms willingly. "Just a hug. And even though we're divorced, if you want to visit our daughter, you can come anytime. I won't consider it a bother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her and walked up to embrace her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person he loved the most!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always thought that there would be a good ending between them, but he never expected that their ending would lead to them becoming strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't have a daughter, maybe in the future, they would truly just be two strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The future...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, Chandler self-mockingly wondered if he even had a future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no need for Tina to know these thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was set Tina free and not let her be trapped in his destiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler held Tina tightly, feeling the warmth and breath in his arms, feeling that she was alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, as long as she was living well, that was the most important thing. Everything else didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, whether you believe it or not, I love you. I wish you a safe and happy life!"</span></p></div>
