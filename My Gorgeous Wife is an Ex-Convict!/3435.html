        <h1>Chapter 3433</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, when the Archer couple saw Mason coming out of Veronica's room, they were both very happy, knowing that the two children had made up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Apart from that, they don't care about anything else. If Mason really did something beyond the boundaries of siblinghood with Veronica, they would probably be even happier and feel that the Barlow family and the Reed family are inseparable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After learning about Mason and Veronica's reconciliation, Lionel's eyes darted around and a mischievous smile appeared on his face. He secretly approached Mason and whispered, "Bro, my method worked, didn't it? Actually, my sister is the type who responds better to kindness than toughness. As long as you're willing to be gentle with her, she'll definitely let go of any grudges."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason looked at Lionel with his dark eyes, but didn't say anything. Lionel, on the other hand, felt a bit uneasy under Mason's gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bro, why are you looking at me like that?" Lionel timidly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are not allowed to repeat what you just said to anyone else. If I hear it from someone else, you may not be able to stay here anymore," said Mason coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel shuddered involuntarily, realizing that the other person was warning him. These words were mainly meant to keep Veronica in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, of course, I definitely won't say it!" Lionel quickly smiled and replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wants to curry favor with the money tree in his own family. Although he is still young, he knows very well that he needs to please Mason if he wants to have a good life in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now those older people who are mixed up in society and bow down to him outside, isn't it all because of Mason's connections that they can easily get a large amount of pocket money from his mother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, of course, he is going to work hard to make sure Mason stays with the Barlow family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Mason only cares about Veronica, all we need to do is to reconcile her with Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And his advice to Mason was clearly successful. So, if he continues to offer advice to Mason on his sister's affairs, Mason will value him more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Will he be better off then than he is now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about this, Lionel felt quite proud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mason returned to the living room, Veronica asked, "What did the kid say to you just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't say anything," said Mason calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he asks you for any favors, don't agree easily," she said, afraid that her younger brother might come up with various excuses to ask for money or help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't want her younger brother to end up like their father and stepmother, who only use Mason and eventually become parasites of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, I know what to do," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, this was indeed Lionel's suggestion that brought him and her back together, so even if he had to give Lionel some benefits, he didn't mind.</p></div>
