        <h1>Chapter 551</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I promise you. You'll always see me." Her gentle voice rang in the air. It was as soft as the softest of comforts, soothing his troubled heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked down, straight into her eyes. "Really? You're not lying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, it's true," she said, for how could he, a man who loved her so much, do anything to hurt her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not Martin Weiss, and their life would not be like Martin Weiss and Kyla&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me you love me and you can't bear not seeing me," he said with a hoarse voice, his bright eyes filled with yearning and longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes the look in his eyes shocked and amazed her, making her feel as if she was the world to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How much did this man love her? If at first, she had doubted his love, now she was certain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I love you." She put her hand on his cheek. She did not understand why he was afraid. Perhaps it was because of his childhood experiences that he felt insecure about love? In that case, she would try to soothe his fears. "Therefore, I can't bear not seeing you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His Adam's apple moved, and a sigh gently escaped his mouth. Then, he lowered his head and kissed her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cool lips kissed her so affectionately, as if he wanted to seize all her sweetness and imprint his breath, his temperature, and everything he had into her soul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was being kissed so hard that she could hardly breathe. Suddenly, Jason picked her up and walked over to the bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He placed her carefully on the bed. His hands rested on either side of her body while his black eyes were full of desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he gently took her hand, pressed her palm against his cheek, and gently rubbed it against her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body quivered slightly as if she understood what was going to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want you, Grace. Do you want me?" he asked in a whisper with a face full of desire and a subdued forbearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that if she said no, he would not touch her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not want to suppress her feelings. "I want you," she looked at him and answered him affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, his body covered hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the most intimate touch and the strongest attachment...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Grace woke up with another bout of back pain. She could only blame it on his charm, which made her indulge in him over and over again...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she opened her eyes, all she could see was his handsome face. He was now lying on his side beside her, looking at her with a smile in his deep, dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um..." Grace whispered a reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're tired, just get some more sleep," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly shook her head. "I have work to do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you so committed to your job?" he said grudgingly. In his opinion, the job at the small restaurant was tiring and underpaid. He could offer her more choices, but she did not want them.</p></div>
