        <h1>Chapter 2500</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a fake family. Our marriage was never real. We only got married because you don't want our child to be a bastard. I didn't end the marriage because I want to see how boring life with you really is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sighed bitterly. "Yeah, I'm a pretty boring wife." She also hoped they could have a happy marriage, but perhaps a marriage based on a deal was never going to be happy from the start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But it's just a family photo. Consider it my last plea to you. I won't ask you for anything more than that, so will you please say yes?" she pleaded with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glimmered. "You won't ask me for anything else? Kyla, don't you think you should be asking me to save you? If something does happen to your liver, I'm the only person who can donate you a liver!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His deep voice with a hint of sarcasm rang in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you&rsquo;ll also be at risk. It's only been more than six years since your last liver transplant. It&rsquo;ll be too risky for you to donate again," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you worried about me? You don't care if people like me live or die." His body suddenly leaned forward, and his face was close to hers. His piercing eyes almost penetrated her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at the face right before her eyes and suddenly raised her hands. She put them gently around his neck, laying her face upon his shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was taken aback by her sudden actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He tried to push her away, but his body seemed to instinctively resist and come closer to her as if he wanted her to hold him tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, don't donate your liver to me. Don't gamble your life away. Giving birth to this baby is my gamble, not yours. So, I'm not going to ask you to donate your liver. I only hope you'll visit the kids more often and bond with them when you're free." All she wanted was for him to live well. That was already a blessing for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened, and her speech scared him. It was as if she was giving her last words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No way. She should not know about her current liver condition. He, Jason, and Grace had reached an agreement that the doctor would not reveal her true condition to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're saying that to use the baby to arouse my sympathy and make me feel sorry and give you my liver, you'd better forget about it. I'm not going to sacrifice myself like that for a woman who doesn't love me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She ended the hug with a smile. "I know you won&rsquo;t. Martin Weiss, I have no regrets for you. I want to sleep now, so can you please leave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she would cry in his presence if he did not leave now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had so many regrets for him that she wished she did not have this illness so that she could tell him that she loved him and was willing to be with him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how much pain they had experienced together, she wanted to try again. She wanted them to try being together again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a pity she could never say that to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This regret was destined to accompany her to her grave!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened as he left without saying a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the sound of the ward door closing rang, tears fell from Kyla's eyes.</p></div>
