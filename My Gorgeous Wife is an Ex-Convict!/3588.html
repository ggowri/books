        <h1>Chapter 3586</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If your feelings for William aren't that strong, why not consider me instead?" Roger leaned in towards Jasper, suddenly lowering his body and bringing his head close to her cheek. His lips approached her ear and he whispered softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gentle voice was almost like a spell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's face turned even redder! He instinctively avoided eye contact, covered his burning ears, and said, "You--"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, if you're not interested in me at all, you can just say so," he said. "Jasper, do you really not have any feelings for me at all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was speechless. "I just... see you as a friend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As a friend?" He suddenly chuckled. "Do you really see me as a friend? Do you see Roger as a friend? Or are you just looking for traces of 'Lawrence' in me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She froze, not knowing how to respond to his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the beginning, she approached him because of his resemblance to Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, his piano, his appearance, and the mole on his neck all seemed to prove that he was Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, she said, "Roger, if you really are Lawrence, why won't you admit it? Is there some hidden reason? Or do you hate me? I...I just want an answer. I...I just hope...you're living well..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice was already choked with emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her expressionlessly, as if her sadness meant nothing to him. "Do you want Roger to live well? Or do you want the Lawrence you speak of to live well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at him with a bit of confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, I'm not Lawrence. Why won't you admit it? Do you have to project Lawrence's image onto me? Is it only if I were Lawrence that you would feel better?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words were like a sharp sword, brutally cutting open the side of her that she didn't want to admit, and causing a sharp pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, she wished he was Lawrence, so that at least it could prove that Lawrence was still alive and doing well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of being gone without a trace, with nothing left in this world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you only see me as Lawrence and want to be friends with me, then I think we may never truly become friends," Roger said before turning and leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper watched him leave and couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing up at the orphanage, Jasper and Meave were on their way back to school when Meave couldn't help but mutter, "Why did Roger leave by himself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He didn't come with us in the first place, so it's not wrong for him to leave first," Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But we're all from the same school, we could have gone back together. Besides, he knows you too!" Meave argued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper pursed her lips, inexplicably sensing that Roger was angry about what she had said to him earlier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Meave, no one wants to be seen as someone else's shadow," Jasper suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't that obvious? Who would want to be seen as someone else's shadow?" Meave replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper lowered her gaze, wondering if Roger really wasn't Lawrence after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And then, the DNA testing laboratory provided the results: the sample sent in was not from the same person as Lawrence's DNA on file.</p></div>
