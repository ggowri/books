        <h1>Chapter 1777</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he pushed open the door, he saw Jasper and William lying on the bed. William seemed to be asleep, while Jasper looked like she was reading as she was holding a storybook. A maid was looking after them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The maid immediately got up when she saw Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You can go out first," Jason told the maid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The maid replied softly and left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Daddy?" Jasper looked at Jason in confusion. 'Uncle Butler said Daddy would be staying with Mommy in the hospital these days. Why is he back again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Were you telling William a story?" Jason asked gently. He had shed his usual indifference and pride. He looked like an ordinary father in front of his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yup!" Jasper said, but in a lower voice than usual. It was as if she was afraid of waking William. "He couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd tell him a story so he could fall asleep. Whenever I can't sleep, Mommy reads me a story and I'll fall asleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper hesitated a little and said to Jason, "Daddy, I know William's mommy is a bad person who wanted to hurt Mommy and my brother, but William isn't a bad person. Can you not send him away? Let him stay here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "Why? Do you like him very much, Jasper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, I do." Jasper nodded her little head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why do you like him?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one said, "Because he plays the piano, and it's strange that he didn't play better when he could. Even so, I&rsquo;d love to hear him play and play with him. It&rsquo;d be fun!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Jasper said this, her apricot eyes that were similar to Grace's seemed to sparkle with light. They were full of expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes flickered with a hint of gloom. "So you deliberately handcuffed yourself to him and flushed the key down the toilet because you thought he could stay if you did that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper did not speak, but her expression seemed to show a tacit agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But did it occur to you that the new key will be delivered soon, and he&rsquo;ll still have to leave the Reed family once the handcuffs are off?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper Reed's little face crinkled up immediately. She pouted and said, "Then... Then I'll throw away the new key!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What she implied was that she would keep William in the Reed family no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at his daughter and said lightly, "Do you think he can stay in the Reed family if you do that? Did it ever occur to you that it's actually a piece of cake if I really want to separate you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one blinked, her eyes full of confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"For example..." Jason glanced at their handcuffed hands. "If William's hand is chopped off, you can still be separated even with the handcuffs on, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper Reed's almond-shaped eyes instantly widened with panic and fear. Suddenly, her small hand immediately pressed on William's handcuffed hand. "Daddy... are&hellip; Are you going to chop off William's hand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her daughter's panicked appearance made Jason feel a little guilty. He should not have said what he did and frightened her, but he wanted her to see the reality of things.</p></div>
