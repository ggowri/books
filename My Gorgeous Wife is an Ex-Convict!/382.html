        <h1>Chapter 381</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You asked me for 50 million dollars. Why don&rsquo;t you just let me help you find out where your mother is buried?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked. He reminded her that she was really stupid. Even if she gave her father 50 million dollars, would her father be satisfied? Would he not ask for more?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like what Jason said, instead of asking him to give her 50 million dollars, she could just ask him to help her find out where her mother's grave was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only say that she panicked, so she did not even notice such a simple thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you take me there now?" Grace asked anxiously. She could only calm down once she was sure where her mother was buried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no hurry. You need to take a break first. Take a nap if you're sleepy," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was not in the mood to sleep! She just looked at him longingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">About 15 minutes later, Jason's phone rang. A moment after Jason answered it, he replied, "All right, got it. Wait for me over there, and settle everything I told you to do as soon as possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he put away his phone. He stood up and said to Grace, "Come with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace instantly realized that he was going to take her to her mother's grave, so she immediately got up and followed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only after she got in the car did she soon realize that they were not heading in the direction of the cemeteries in Emerald City. Instead, they were heading for a large residential area in the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car stopped, Grace looked on in surprise. She then turned to look at Jason in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, his car was parked in an urban village in the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on," he said, taking her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Jason stiffly, walking all the way to one of the houses. She saw Jason's secretary, Terrence, there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Other than Terrence, she also saw a few others who looked like bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing Jason, Terrence immediately came forward and said, "It's inside, Young Master Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason led Grace into the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Clearly, Terrence had cleared the house beforehand. Grace walked into it and could see that it was a place for group rental, but the house was deserted at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence went ahead and opened one of the rooms. It was a simple room with only a bed and a table. There was nothing on the bed&mdash;not even a bedsheet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace entered the room, she saw a box on the table. Apart from this, there was nothing else on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was&hellip; a cinerary casket!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's pupils contracted suddenly as she stepped forward. Her hands were almost trembling as she touched the urn. On the side of the cinerary casket, she could find the small print inscribed with her mother's name and the date of her death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was... her mother's cinerary casket!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt her heart tremoring. She thought that since her father was going to move her mother's grave, he would at least buy her a cemetery plot so that she could be buried again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it never occurred to her that her father had not even bought her mother a cemetery plot. He just rented a room in a group rental house to put her ashes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence's statements also confirmed Grace's speculation.</p></div>
