        <h1>Chapter 2671</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not love Barbara Schuman. He even became an exchange student and left the university without hesitation and reluctance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's find a place to sit after I finish giving out the mooncakes. It's been so long that I have so much to say to you," Barbara Schuman said gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's thin lips were almost pressed into a straight line. He glanced at Valda Theller, who was turning to leave. Moments later, his eyes fell on Barbara Schuman again. He slowly uttered one word. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At noon, in the private room of a restaurant room near the film studio, Barbara Schuman looked at Raymond Bowman and smiled. "Speaking of which, how many years have we not seen each other? It's been almost eight years, right? When you went abroad as an exchange student, you never contacted me again. I didn't know you returned until I saw you in the photo of the TV show&rsquo;s booting ceremony."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What on earth are you up to? You suddenly sponsored this show under the guise of business," Raymond Bowman asked as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman said, "Didn't you also invest in this TV show? What about you? What are you up to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both of them looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, Barbara Schuman smiled and said, "You're not gonna tell me that you invested in this TV show for Valda Theller, are you? You stopped at nothing to make her a fool back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's face darkened. "Shut up. I won't go easy on you if you bring it up again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman&rsquo;s smile grew sweeter. "We were partners in crime back in the day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face instantly turned pale, and the words &lsquo;partners in crime&rsquo; stung.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, I've never forgotten you all these years," Barbara Schuman said as she reached forward and touched Raymond Bowman's hand suggestively. "Now that we&rsquo;ve met again, why don't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman shook off her hand and got up, saying, "Barbara Schuman, you're not the one I love, so nothing will happen even if we meet again. I only came here to tell you to leave Valda Theller alone whatever the purpose of your sponsorship is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's expression changed slightly. "What if I don't want to leave Valda Theller alone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then your factory might not be able to make mooncakes anymore next year." Raymond Bowman's tone was dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that a threat?" Barbara Schuman glared at Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just telling you what might happen!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're so protective of Valda Theller. Don't tell me you're in love with Valda Theller," she said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He unexpectedly confessed, "Yes, I love her, so I won't let you hurt her again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman froze for a long time before suddenly laughing and saying, "Hahaha... Did you fall in love with Valda Theller? What kind of joke is this? We were partners in crime. You loved me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's face darkened. "What happened back then is my biggest regret. Barbara Schuman, you'd better watch out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he turned around and left.</p></div>
