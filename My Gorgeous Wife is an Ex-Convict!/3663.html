        <h1>Chapter 3661</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William asked Jasper, "What did you say to him today? What does he mean by 'making up for it'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stared at Roger's back for a moment and said, "I didn't say anything. I want to go back. Can you take me home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flickered slightly. "Sure, let's get in the car. I'll take you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two got in the car, and William helped Jasper fasten his seatbelt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper closed his eyes wearily. He had been waiting at the bar for three hours tonight, and now he felt exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William started the car, turned the steering wheel, and drove in the opposite direction of Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Roger, who was walking on the other side, stopped and watched the car gradually getting farther away. His right hand hung down, still feeling the warmth of her hand when he held it before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, even now, you still let go of my hand." Roger murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he was always the one left behind. Was William the one who could truly stand by her side?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the car, Jasper stared at his own hand absentmindedly. He didn't know what Lawrence had been through all these years. He was just a 10-year-old child who had experienced such a big change and was taken away from the hospital. He might not </span><span>have had a good life before being adopted by the Elliott family and becoming Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she didn't know how he was adopted, she wondered what kind of hardships he had gone through as a child before being taken in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked at Jasper, who was lost in thought, and felt a sinking feeling in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that her mind was probably filled with thoughts of Lawrence at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his view, Lawrence was like a ticking time bomb, filled with intense resentment. And usually, it was better to defuse such a bomb as early as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...that person was Lawrence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the one she had been yearning for all these years! If he really got rid of Lawrence, she would probably never forgive him for the rest of her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, was Lawrence really just filled with resentment towards her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was clearly another kind of feeling there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, William's hand on the steering wheel tightened unconsciously. He didn't want to see either kind of feeling from Lawrence in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, do you think Lawrence has gone through a lot in these years? Even though he's now a child of the Elliott family and living a comfortable life, what about before that? How did he end up going abroad? What did he go through on the way?" Jasper's voice suddenly rang out in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want me to help you investigate? Even though it's been many years, we might be able to find something," William offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper shook her head. "No need. If he's willing to tell me himself one day, then I'll know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you plan to do with him in the future?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll try my best to become friends with him again and make up for what I can," Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if he's not willing? Besides, he's now the heir of the Elliott family and doesn't lack anything material. What do you plan to use to make up for it?" William questioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suddenly thought of Lawrence's proposal to date her and shook her head vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing, just feeling...you're right. Sometimes, even if you want to make up for it, it's really hard to do so," Jasper said.</span></p></div>
