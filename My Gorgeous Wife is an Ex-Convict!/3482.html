        <h1>Chapter 3480</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, we need a billion, and in US dollars! Anyway, the Reed family has so much money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A group of young people were discussing, but Lionel became more and more frightened as he listened. "What are you talking about? A billion-dollar ransom? Didn't we agree that you would help me stage a fake kidnapping?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What fake kidnapping? How can there be a distinction between real and fake kidnapping?" The other person chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can you do this? I, I'm not doing it anymore!" Lionel shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are the mastermind, how can you not do anything? This whole thing was planned by you. You were the one who led them into the private room, released the gas to make them unconscious, and finally, you were the one who took them out and put them in the car. Look, it's all because of you!" said the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel was dumbfounded as he realized that he had already fallen into the trap set by the other party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're just here to assist you. Anyway, if you get caught, you'll be the one with the heaviest charge. So, Mr. Barlow, it's best for you to cooperate with us now. That way, we can all be safe and sound!" The other person spoke while patting Lionel's shoulder reassuringly. "Now, you're on the same boat as us. If you want this matter to end well, you need to cooperate with our actions!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel is at a loss for words. He only intended to stage a fake kidnapping, but now it has turned into a real one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper and Veronica went missing at the nightclub, and the driver was the first to notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, the driver nervously reported this matter to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, the nightclub was surrounded by both the police and members of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some of the surveillance equipment was damaged, so there is currently a lack of specific information about the disappearance of Veronica and Jasper from the nightclub.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to the driver who brought them here, Jasper came with Veronica to find her brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the moment, Lionel's whereabouts are unknown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After further investigation into Lionel's recent whereabouts and activities, the police discovered that he has been frequently associating with members of social gangs. Additionally, they found records of Lionel purchasing gas with a special incapacitating function online. Furthermore, there have been reports of Lionel mentioning words related to kidnapping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, someone began to speculate whether Lionel had kidnapped Jasper and Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the Barlow family heard this speculation, they were almost fainting and kept denying that their son could never do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, unfortunately, Lionel is currently missing and all the relevant evidence points towards him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After learning that her eldest daughter and Veronica had gone missing, Grace didn't break down in tears or faint, but her trembling fingers betrayed her fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will Lionel really be the one to do this?" Grace asked her husband. After all, Lionel is just a middle school student, and she has watched him grow up. Although the child is not likable, she doesn't think he has the courage to plan such a kidnapping event.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not sure yet, but even if he didn't do it, he might still be involved," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He naturally knew that a junior high school student, no matter how capable, could not have carried out such a kidnapping case. Or perhaps it was more likely that Lionel was being used as a pawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I just don't know what kind of role Lionel played in this matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace saw a flash of cruelty in her husband's eyes and knew that unless Lionel wasn't truly planning to kidnap someone, he wouldn't spare even a member of the Barlow family or a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, family is his bottom line!</p></div>
