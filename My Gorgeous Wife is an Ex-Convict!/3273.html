        <h1>Chapter 3271</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, stop thinking about the child, why don't you think about me instead?" Jason said with a hint of teasing. He didn't want his wife to keep worrying about these troublesome things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace laughed, "So how do you want me to think about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For example, like this..." he said, leaning in and planting a kiss on her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could react, he continued to shower her with kisses on her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One kiss after another, making Grace feel a little dizzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jason..." she breathed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That sounds so nice, I love it when you call me Jason," he kissed her deeply on the lips, and after a while, he ended the kiss and lightly stroked her rosy lips. "You're the only one who can call me Jason, Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know," she smiled, and this time, it was her turn to kiss him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The night was long, and for them, the rest of their lives was still long...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Jason sent his personal secretary, Terrence Klein, directly to the elementary school where Lawrence was studying. The children who had taken Lawrence's watch the day before, along with their parents, were also called into the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When these parents found out that the watch was worth over ten thousand, they were completely shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who would have thought that a regular kid would be wearing such an expensive children's watch on their hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several parents were constantly scolding their children, afraid that they might cause trouble. After all, Mr. Reed's personal secretary had appeared before them today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The watch naturally returned to Lawrence's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona's chin was raised high as she accepted the apologies of the parents. She felt that even the teacher's gaze towards her had changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, Mr. Reed sent his personal secretary to support her. Now everyone will know that she has truly established a relationship with the Reed family. From now on, she can walk around this school with confidence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, I'm afraid there will be many people trying to flatter her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Wilona felt justified in her actions from yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After resolving the matter, Terrence, Wilona, and Lawrence left the office together. Lawrence went back to the classroom first, while Wilona kept thanking Terrence repeatedly, saying, "Terrence, thank you so much for today. And when you see Mr. Reed, please tell him how grateful I am that he helped Lawrence get justice. Otherwise, those kids might continue to bully Lawrence in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Terrence and Wilona walked out of the school gate, Terrence stopped and turned to look at Wilona. He said, "Ms. Yuan, Mr. Reed has a few things he wants me to tell you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Wilona immediately smiled and asked, "What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Reed said that in this world, there are many people who play the piano well. Lawrence is fortunate to have caught Jasper's attention, but he should not think that this fortune can be used recklessly. If he tries to use Jasper and the Reed family again by playing clever tricks, he should carefully consider whether he can bear the consequences.</p></div>
