        <h1>Chapter 1601</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then... Why don't you play with me? I want to play. Mason, accompany me!" The little girl thought for a moment before taking a different approach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay." This time, the boy named Mason said yes without hesitation. "Sis, if you want to play, I'll play with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The appellation &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; made Grace tremble again. Not only was the look in the little boy's eyes and his expression just like Jay but also the way he called out &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two children got up with the little girl taking the little boy's hand. The chubby boy called Lil Tian walked over, followed by several older boys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The chubby boy said to the older boys, "He's the one I'm talking about. He's a good fighter. I've never seen him lose and I&rsquo;m sure you can't beat him either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He Yetian, what are you talking about?" the little girl snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm not wrong. Mason Swanson's a good fighter!" the chubby little boy said with a look of mischief on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Watching this, Grace knew the chubby little boy was saying those words on purpose to trigger the other boys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, the older boys were ready to fight Mason Swanson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little girl refused, and she used her tiny body to shield the little boy as she said to the boys, "My brother doesn't fight. We came to play, not to fight! Go away, or you... You're gonna get it from me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her threats had no effect. One of the boys in the lead pushed the little girl away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was too late for Grace to stop them now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little girl stumbled and was pushed to the floor, banging her head against a pillar. She screamed in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The cry of pain seemed to trigger the little boy named Mason Swanson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, the thin little boy pounced at the boy who had pushed the little girl like a beast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a noticeable difference in the physique of both boys. However, the older child was immediately tackled by the little boy. Several other boys wanted to help but were also tackled to the floor by the small and thin child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was shocked. She could even see that the way the child fought was not the random fighting style of ordinary children but... he was hitting the weak spots in the joints. His tiny fists were probably stronger than children of the same age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, the children were defeated almost instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy was still punching the boy who had pushed the little girl, while the chubby little boy was petrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace quickly skirted the fence and rushed inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Other people around them noticed what was happening and gathered around to pull the little boy away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the little one stuck to the older boy like candy and continued to punch him. Even the adults could not pull the two apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little girl hugged the little boy and said, "Ci, stop. I&rsquo;m not hurt, I&rsquo;m not hurt!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy finally let go and looked at the girl. "You&rsquo;re not hurt?"</p></div>
